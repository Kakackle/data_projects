i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading, and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off, they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music, you make elevator music ""oh, he's too mainstream."" well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it ""it's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock, shock rap with doc throw on ""lose yourself"" and make 'em lose it ""i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use."" let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains, i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?! ugh, school flunky, pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself, but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you i'm drunk, so, satan, take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz, still ""chunky but funky"" but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have, then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? make lemonade then! but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake 'em a cake then? don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and don't be a retard—be a king?

judgin' her past and shit? well, it's completely my future her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit and i'ma need that forty dollars even if i got to fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot, gonzales park, i'm followed by a married man, and father of three my titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with e's he got a cousin named david and i seen him last week this is the life of another girl damaged by the system these foster homes, i run away and never do miss 'em see, my hormones just run away and if i can get 'em back to where they used to be, then i'll probably be in the denim of a family gene that show women how to be woman or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin' then you probably need to beat her, that's how i was taught three niggas in one room, first time i was tossed and i'm exhausted, but fuck that ""sorry for your loss"" shit my sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain if you can't fit the pumps i walk in? i'll wait… your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date, just make sure i'm not in the song 'cause i don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own and matter fact, did i mention that i physically feel great? a doctor's approval is a waste of time, i know i'm straight i'll probably live longer than you and never fade away i'll never fade away, i'll never fade away, i know my fate and i'm on the grind for this cake, i'ma get it or die tryin' i'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin' you lyin' to these motherfuckers talkin' about you can help 'em with my story you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit… when the lights shut off and it's my turn to settle down, my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off and it's my turn to settle down, my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me  sometimes i look in the mirror and ask myself: am i really scared of passin' away? if it's today, i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost 'til it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin' the scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance with the other side may come soon, and if i'm doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe 'cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when i'ma rest and you're right, your brother was a brother to me and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the tv screen by any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between her personal life, i was like ""it need to be told"" cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul exactly what'd happen if i ain't continue rappin' or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's i count lives, all on these songs look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone am i worth it?
