this evil serpent sold the dream to that hes deserted but i think its workin these verses are makin him a wee bit nervous and hes too scurred to answer me with words cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least hes heard it cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin him or ask if im linked to terrorists i

lived in either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block and your mom was savin money for you in a jar tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college almost had a thousand dollars til someone broke in and stole it and i know it hurt so bad it broke your mamas heart and it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart mom and dad was arguin a lot so mama moved back on to chalmers in the flat onebedroom apartment and dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on novara and thats when daddy went to california with his cd and met dr dre and flew you and mama out to see me but daddy had to work you and mama had to leave me then you started seein daddy on the tv and mama didnt like it and you and lainie were too young to understand it papa was a

distorted i find nothing but trouble in my life im fortunate you believe in a dream this orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine and last night was just another distraction or a reaction of what we consider madness i know exactly what happened you ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help held him like a newborn baby and made him feel like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up but the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will thats blood spilled on your hands my plans rather vindictive everybodys a victim in my eyes when i ride its a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black a demon glued to my back whispering ""get em"" i got em and i aint give a fuck that same mentality i told my brother not to duck in actuality its a trip how we trip off of colors i wonder if ill ever discover a passion like you and recover the life that i knew as a youngin in pajamas and duntaduns when thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb niggas like me never prosper prognosis of a problem child im proud and welldevoted this piru shit been in me forever so forever ima push it wherever whenever and i love you cause you love my brother like you did just

this is the life of another girl damaged by the system these foster homes i run away and never do miss em see my hormones just run away and if i can get em back to where they used to be then ill

in one room first time i was tossed and im exhausted but fuck that ""sorry for your loss"" shit my sister died in vain but what point are you tryna gain if you cant fit the pumps i walk in ill wait… your rebuttal a little too late and if you have a album date just make sure im not in the song cause i dont need the attention bring enough of that on my own and matter fact did i mention that i physically feel great a doctors approval is a waste of time i know im straight ill probably live longer than you and never fade away ill never fade away ill never fade away i know my fate and im on

promise that you will sing about me i said when the lights shut off and its my turn to settle down my main concern promise that you will sing about me promise that you will sing about me  sometimes i look in the mirror and ask myself am i really scared of passin away if its today i hope i hear a cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon with the holy ghost til it drown in the blood of jesus i wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin the scent of a reaper ensurin that my allegiance with the other side may come soon and if im doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and im not sure why im infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe cause im a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wonderin when ima rest and youre right your brother was a brother to me and your sisters situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak on somethin thats realer than the tv screen by any means wasnt tryin to offend or come between her personal life i was like ""it need to be told"" cursin the life of twenty generations after her soul exactly whatd happen if i aint continue rappin or steady bein distracted by money drugs and 45s i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one day youll be strong fightin for your rights even when youre wrong

inside he was hurt cause hed done all he could my papa was a great old man i can see him with a shovel in his hand see education he never had he did wonders when the time got bad the little money from the crops he raised barely paid the bills we made oh life had kicked him down to the ground when he tried to get up life would kick him back down one day papa called me to his dyin bed put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said he said ""patches im depending on you son to pull the family through my son its all left up to you"" two days later papa passed away and i became a man that day so i told mama i was gonna quit school but she said that was daddys strictest rule you might also likeso every morning fore i went to school i fed the chickens and i chopped wood too sometimes i felt that i couldnt go on i wanted to leave just run away from home but i would remember what my daddy said with tears in his eyes on his dyin bed he said ""patches im depending on you son ive tried to do

and you know mama knew what i was going through cause every day i had to work the fields cause thats the only way we got our meals see i was the oldest of the family and everybody else depended on me every night i heard my mama pray ""lord give him strength to make another day"" though years have passed and all the kids have grown the angels took mama to a brand new home lord knows people i shedded tears but my daddys voice helped me through the years sayin ""patches im depending on you son to pull the family through my son its all left up to you"" oh i could still hear papas voice sayin ""patches im depending on you son ive tried to do my best its up to you to do the rest"" i could still hear papa when hes saying ""patches im depending on you son to pull the family through my son its
