Boy, I've been watching you like the hawk in the sky
That flies, but you were my prey (My prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days (Days)
We gon' hook it up, prolly talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it

But if I, if I let you know
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

Boy, won't you pick me up at the park right now
Up the block, while everyone sleep, sleep, sleep
I'll be waiting there with my trench, my locs, my hat
Just so I'm lowkey, If you tell the world

Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you

But if I, If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
I hope you're responsible
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody

Baby girl, I'm the man from the big VA
Won't you come play round my way
And listen to what I gotta say
Timbaland (What) don't you know I am the man
Rock shows here to Japan
Have people shaking, shaking my hand
Baby girl, better known as Aaliyah
Give me goosebumps and high fevers
Makin' playa haters believers
Don'tcha know, gotta tell somebody, cause
'Cause I really need somebody (What?)
Tell me you're that somebody (Say what?)
If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?

Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in Manchester
Just swerving with Balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassing
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know
Can't you talk to me?
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby (Yo, what's up?)
Sometimes you are all alone (Need your love, need your love)
But there's no doubt (All the love)
So don't just shut me out
'Cause that's not what love's about
Tell me why

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Yeah)
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (No, I can't)
Came too far to give up, gotta try
'Cause I can't do it on my own
Ooh (Oh)
What's up?

Can you talk to me? (Can you talk to me?)
Tell me what you need (Tell me what you need)

Let me know
Let me know
Haah, haaaah, let me know, let me know
Let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know
There are times when I'll find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see, yeah

But at your best, you are love, yes
You're a positive, motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why?
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me, yeah

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
I'm all about, all about

Straight from high school, you up and left me
We were close friends, also lovers
Did everything for one another
Now you're gone and I'm lost without you here now
But I know I gotta live and make it somehow
Come back to me, can you feel me calling?

Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you

When we hooked up
We sat down, made an agreement
We vowed that, that we'd always
Be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never, ever leave us
That was awhile ago
But now lately it feels like, I mean, I feel like
All we do is fight every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back and take it way back
All the way back, can we start again?
Do it over, can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?

Yo, turn my music up

Mama always told me to be careful who I love
And daddy always told me make sure he's right
I always had my eyes on this one particular guy
I was too shy, so I decided to write

I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time

People always say that I've played myself for you
They say that you don't even notice me (Me, me, me, me, me, me)
Maybe when I get the nerve to come to you
Promise me that you won't diss me

I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss
And when I write him, he better get it on time
I'm sending him a four page letter
And I enclosed it with a kiss

And have a real conversation with your fuckin' boy
With the fuckin' man, Mr. Lover-Lover-Man

How come you ain't never busy when I'm busy
But the moment that I'm free
You always end up with some other plans?
How you make a good dude wait so long?
I don't understand why, that's some girl shit
And what you doin' in the bedroom with your clothes on?

How can I explain myself to you?
Questions keep lurking through my mind

If it is real, I sure can't see

And in my, my heart won't take no more
I know it seems that I don't care
Sometimes my ways of love ain’t fair
I feel it's time for me to take a stand
See, you have given me no choice
I feel I must exercise my voice and say

This feeling, there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold, I can see your breath, I swear
They told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along

At night, I lay awake in tears and pain (Tears and pain)
Searching my heart for what went wrong (Hey)
Askin' myself ""What's goin' on?""
Why cannot we seem to see things eye to eye? (Eye to eye)
Sometimes I really feel the danger (Hey)
And now I'm sleeping with a stranger
To see all these years, we flushed 'em down the drain (Down the drain)
Is that a love that came for us?
Now, it's too late for both of us
No regrets of what we’ve lost and what we’ve shared
Maybe tomorrow we'll love again (Yeah)

And every girl in here got to look me up and down

Circulate the image every time I come around

Le sexe, je veux dire: l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça ?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe, mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

Remember those walls I built?
Well, baby, they're tumblin' down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you in
But I never really had a doubt
Standin' in the light of your halo
I got my angel now

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'
It's the risk that I'm takin'
I ain't never gonna shut you out

Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face

You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like fallin'
Gravity can't begin
To pull me back to the ground again

It's like I've been awakened
Every rule, I had you breakin'

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I'd roll out of bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls
I'd kick it with who I wanted
And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home
To come home

'Cause he's taken you for granted (Granted)
And everything you had got destroyed

It's a little too late for you to come back
Say, it's just a mistake, think I'd forgive you like that
If you thought I would wait for you
You thought wrong

But you're just a boy
You don't understand (Yeah, you don't understand, oh)
How it feels to love a girl
Someday, you'll wish you were a better man
You don't listen to her
You don't care how it hurts
Until you lose the one you wanted
'Cause you've taken her for granted
And everything you have got destroyed
But you're just a boy67Embed 139 ContributorsMine Lyrics

To win the war caused by pain, pain
But every diamond has imperfections
But my love's too pure to watch it chip away
Boy, nothing real can be threatened
True love breathes salvation back into me
With every tear came redemption
And my torturer became my remedy
So many people, I know that they're just tryna touch ya
Kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you
Give you some time to prove that I can trust you again
I'm gonna kiss up and rub up and feel up
Kiss up and rub up and feel up on you

All night long
Love all night long
Sweet love all night long
Sweet love all night long
All I wanna, ain't no other
We together, I remember
Sweet love all night long

Your challengers are a young group from Houston
Welcome Beyoncé, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly, and Ashley
The hip-hop-rappin' Girls' TYME!
Part I: ""Bow Down""

I'm out that H-Town, comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches (Crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches (Crown)
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches (Crown)
H-Town vicious, H-H-Town vicious
I'm so crown-crown, bow down, bitches

H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down

Part II: ***Flawless
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
Say, ""I look so good tonight""
Goddamn, goddamn
Say, ""I look so good tonight""
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
My mama taught me good home-trainin'
My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so goddamn fine, I'm flawless
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)

Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe

Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Anything else that you may read between the lines

Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

Someone I thought had died

Oh, I'm screamin' out and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'

I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong

And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed

Baby, can't you see I'm callin'?
A guy like you should wear a warnin'

Losing my head, spinnin' round and round
Do you feel me now?

Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when

Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear

What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

Ooh

At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you're haunting me
I guess I need you, baby26Embed 51 ContributorsLucky Lyrics
This is a story about a girl named Lucky

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""
And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star""
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
""If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?""

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""
And they say

""I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky""
""Oh my God, here she comes!""

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star""
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
""If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?""

Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse

That means you're speaking my language, come on

Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah

He is a hustler, he's no good at all
He is a loser, he's a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun
I know you told me I should stay away
I know you said he's just a dog astray
He's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

He is a villain by the devil's law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
The man's a snitch and unpredictable
He's got no conscience, he got none, none, none, none
Oh-oh, I know, oh, should've let go, but no
'Cause he's a bad boy with a tainted heart
And even I know this ain't smart

But mama, I'm in love with a criminal
And this type of love isn't rational, it's physical
Mama, please don't cry, I will be alright
All reason aside, I just can't deny, love the guy

Tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm
So I guess it's okay, he's with me

Try to make remarks, keep us apart

'Cause mama, I'm in love with a criminal

You tell me you're in love with me

It's not that I don't wanna stay
But every time you come too close, I move away

But if you really want me, move slow

Sometimes I hide
Sometimes I'm scared of you
But all I really want is to hold you tight
Treat you right
Be with you day and night

Dark mascara dripping down my face
Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

Last night I was in your arms so strong (It felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)

We crossed the line and it was on, we crossed the line
It was on this time
I've been denying how I feel
You've been denying what you want, you want from me
Talk to me, baby

I want some satisfaction, take me to the stars (Hey)
Just like ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah

I wanna cut through the clouds, break the ceiling
I wanna dance on the roof, you and me alone
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah (Woo)
I wanna play where you play with the angels
I wanna wake up with you all in tangles, oh
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah
I wanna cut to the feeling, oh yeah

Cancel your reservations
No more hesitations, this is on, can't make it stop
Give me all you got
I want it all or nothing
No more in-between, now give your everything to me

Be tormented by me, babe
Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me, babe
Let it hit you cold and hot
Let your feelings be revealing that you can't forget me

Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not

In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
Fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it
This emotion, you feel it
All that we could do with this emotion

Paint a picture for me, boy
Where the sky's forever blue
Tell me there is nothing I can't have and nothing you won't do
Toss and turn without me, boy
Let it hit you cold and hot
All my kisses, say you'll miss it and you can't forget me

I used to be in love with you
You used to be the first thing on my mind
I know I'm just a friend to you

But I still love you, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I love you

But I can't get you out of my head
And I want you to miss me when I'm not around you

Oh, won't you come around to the spot that we met?

Woke up this mornin', it feels like every day
I got the blues, babe, not going away
Another bad dream where you were running away
I'm forever haunted by our time
We had a moment, we had a summertime
Asked me to leave with you, but I could never decide
I've been so torn up, I've been so out of it
I'm forever haunted by our time

I've been all alone, on my own
Every single night, I pray
When you coming home? Coming home?
'Cause I've been livin' for that day

Julien, in your heart, yeah, you must believe
Julien, it was more than a fantasy
To the end, to the last breath that I breathe
I'll be whispering, ""Julien""

Boy number one made a picnic for two
Saw he was nervous, I thought it was cute
Until I found out that his mom made the food
It was good though
Boy number two had a beautiful face
I highly agreed to go back to his place
His wife really had some impeccable taste
She was sweet though

This roller coaster's a carousel
And I'm getting nowhere

Boys around the world, I want to believe that

I can see you spinning around in your head
(There's a little ghost of us)
A little history of us in there (Oh)
And now we've finally got to the safe other side
(Something's coming over us)
Why would we risk it for another try?

Waking up next to you every morning
How did we get this far? It came without a warning
And in the nighttime, you tell me your whole life
You and me get too real but all I feel is alright

Tell me you'll keep it, mmm

I remember being naked
We were young freaks just fresh to LA
Never cared about the fake kids
We would write and sing and wear whatever

But money makes your whole world spin
'Til everything is dizzying
And suddenly...

Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop
Planes, I'm hopping
Cards, I'm dropping
No shop can fill me up
There's a little black hole in my golden cup, so
You pour, and I'll say stop, so
Take me into your arms again
Shake me from LA hallucinations

Used to stay up all night, he and I
Filling up each other's pages
But the teeth come out when the camera flashes

We said we'd always be the same
But we lost each other in the game

You pour, and I'll say stop

Whatever happened to predictability?
The milkman, the paperboy, the evening tv?
How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me, please
'Cause this old world is just really confusing me

Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird that knows your tune
Then a little voice inside of you whispers
""Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!""

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you

Whatever happened to the good old days?
Talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away
Now I'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene
Cause how do you know where you're going, if you really don't know who you've been?

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you

Drove by your place, and stopped again tonight

Always busy dreamin' 'bout boys, boys, boys (XCX)

I need that bad boy to do me right on a Friday
And I need that good one to wake me up on a Sunday
That one from work can come over on Monday night

Them twenty questions, they askin' me where I'm at

Know I keep on saying I'm alright
But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess I’ll go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry ’bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call

Champagne pourin' in your mouth
Called your friends from out of town
Got the party bag with the purple pills
And I'm waiting for you by the window, yeah
Called your digits, but the phone kept ringin'
Wish I knew what you were thinking, na-na-na

Kiss me on the mouth, say you love me?

Don't say you love me 'cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry 'cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings, but won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on, you'll never see me cry
I hate the silence (Ah-ah), that's why the music's always loud
So many problems (Ah-ah), I try to drown 'em out
1000 bottles (Ah-ah), collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

You're so forgiving (Ah-ah), my friends think you're the best
From the beginning (Ah-ah), your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection (Ah-ah), it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the best damn part of me was always you
You might also like
I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love, yeah
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
One day I'll pull through and I'll be good enough
I don't deserve you, I don't deserve your love
Oh, your love

Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy

Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me

He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough

I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision

I know it's hot
I know we've got
Something that money can't buy
Fighting in fits
Biting your lip
Loving 'til late in the night

Tell me I'm too crazy
You can't tame me, can't tame me
Tell me I have changed
But I'm the same me, old same me
Inside
Hey!

If you don't like the way I talk, then why am I on your mind?
If you don't like the way I rock, then finish your glass of wine
We fight and we argue, you'll still love me blind
If we don't fuck this whole thing up
Guaranteed, I can blow your mind

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?

Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

Fighting for you

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free

Come on, girls!
Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

It's a beautiful life, but I'm not concerned
It's a beautiful dream, but a dream is earned
I can dress like a boy, I can dress like a girl
Keep your beautiful words, 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is
Up in flames

It's a beautiful plan (Hmm), but I'm not concerned (Oh, yeah)
It's a beautiful game (Hmm) that I never learned
People tell me to shut my mouth (Shut your mouth), that I might get burned
Keep your beautiful lies (Hmm) 'cause I'm not concerned

'Cause your world is such a shame
'Cause your world's obsessed with fame
'Cause your world's in so much pain
'Cause your world is, 'cause your world is—

I will﻿ not denounce the things that I have said
I will not renounce my faith in my sweet Lord
He has chosen me to fight against the English
And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him
You can cut my hair and throw me in a jail cell
Say that I'm a witch and burn me at the stake
It's all a big mistake
Don't you know to doubt Him is a sin?

Do my tears of mourning sink beneath the sun?
She's got herself a universe gone quickly
For the call of thunder threatens everyone

And I feel like I just got home

Faster than the speeding light she's flying
Trying to remember where it all began
She's got herself a little piece of heaven
Waiting for the time when Earth shall be as one

Wake up, ex-wife
This is your life
Children, on your own
Turning on the telephone
Messages, manager
No time for a manicure
Working out, shake my ass
I know how to multitask
Connecting to the Wi-Fi
Went from nerd to superb
Have you seen the new guy?
I forgot the password
Gotta call the babysitter
Tweeting on the elevator
I could take a helicopter
I don't even feel the pressure

I'm gonna be okay
I don't care what the people say
I'm gonna be alright
Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right

RIde my horse, break some bones
Take it down a semitone
I forgot to say my prayers
Baby Jesus on the stairs
Gotta sign a contract
Gotta get my money back
All the bottles have to go
Standing in the front row

Diminished myself and swallowed my light
I tried to become all that you expect of me

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

He left the bloodstains on the carpet

So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
(Don't worry what people say, we know the truth)
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
(Enough is enough of this garbage!)
(Okay, okay, alright)
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us


Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone mad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang-bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me

I am a victim of police brutality now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me off my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to Heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free

Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black man, blackmail, throw the brother in jail

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us

And tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame (Ooh)
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name (Ooh)
I can't believe this is the land from which I came (Ooh)
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no
Skinhead, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me

All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us


Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no

Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation (Hoo-hoo)
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food (Hoo-hoo)
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me

It's close to midnight
And something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh

You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination (Girl)
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin’ up behind
You're out of time

And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
(They're open wide)
This is the end of your life, ooh

They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side (Ooh)
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah

So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller (Ow)

I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood (I'm gonna thrill you tonight)
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

I'm gonna make a change for once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

And a miracle has happened tonight, hee!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh!

Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee!)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white

Alright, alright

Alright (Yeah, yeah, yeah), yeah, now
Alright, alright (Ooh-ooh-ooh)
Shamone, don't (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

She's saying ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need""
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says ""There's no turning back""
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
(Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no)

She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree

She's saying ""That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star""

She said ""I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?""
I said ""My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright""

Diana walked up to me
She said, ""I'm all yours tonight""
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying, ""Baby, I'm alright""
I said ""But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key""
She said ""He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me""

Think about, um, the generations and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and our children's children, so that they, they, they s—they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place...

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
You might also like
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race (Oh, no)
There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
(Yeah) There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
(Then) Make a better place for you and for me
(Everyone, there are) There are people dying (Oh)
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

(You and for me) Make a better place

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself ""How did love slip away?""
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there

But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you (Ooh)

I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
You might also like
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, ""I love you so, I'll never let you go""

Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?

Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now, baby
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)
Do you remember the time?
('Cause I remember)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(All in my mind, girl)
Do you remember the time?
(Oh, I)
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
(Remember, my baby)

(Remember the time)
Hoo!
(Remember the time)
Do you remember, girl?
(Remember the time)
On the phone, you and me
(Remember the time)
'Til dawn, 'til three
What about us, girl?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you, do you?
(Remember the time)
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach

You and me, in Spain
What about, what about

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me

Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm

Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same

I hate to think that I was just your type

Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her

You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart

He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?

And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you

All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy

Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day

I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her

And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?

I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, and I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting ""send""
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)

Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back; yeah)

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

You built me up to watch me fall
You have everything, and you still want more

But even after all this, you're still everything to me

I want it to be, like, messy

I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
""Enjoy your youth,"" I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best

They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear

Know that I loved you so bad

Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends

Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood runnin' cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell

Each time I step outside, it's social suicide
It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide

Ah, ah, ah

Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like, the whole night (Oh)

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
Another thing I ruined I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed

Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed

And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light, I can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen

Falls from the February sky

Said I was too young, I was too soft

I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)

Hand under my sweatshirt

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending

I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan

We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
You might also like
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my

I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
You might also like
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)102Embed 157 ContributorsTranslationsPortuguêsEspañolFrançaisСрпскиSvenskaItalianoالعربيةDeutschTürkçeУкраїнськаPolskiIs It Over Now? (Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?
Uh-huh

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said, ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you94Embed 198 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolСрпскиPortuguêsPolskiItalianoMagyarDeutschFrançaisفارسی中文РусскийالعربيةУкраїнськаSvenskaCruel Summer Lyrics

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason

And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

I sit and watch you readin' with your head low
I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn
I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser, and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow

Always takin' up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)

Break free and leave us in ruins?
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it

We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet90Embed 179 ContributorsTranslationsPolskiРусскийFrançaisTürkçeEspañolСрпскиPortuguêsItalianoDeutschEnd Game Lyrics

Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumours, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it’s easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, somethin' was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just another ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)

And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em

Blood on my conscience
And murder in mind
Out of the gloom I rise up from my tomb
Into impending doom
Now my body is my shrine

The blood runs free

Give me the wine, you keep the bread
The voices echo in my head
Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow
There is no tomorrow
For the sinners will be damned
Ashes to ashes
You cannot exhume a soul
Who do you trust when corruption and lust creed of all the unjust
Leaves you empty and unwhole?

Into a living death
I empathize with enemies
Until the timing’s right
With God and Satan at my side
From darkness will come light

I watch the rain as it turns red
Give me more wine
I don’t need bread
These riddles that live in my head
I don’t believe that God is dead
God is dead
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
Wondering if we will meet again on the other side
Do you believe a word what the Good Book said?
Or is it just a holy fairytale and God is dead?
God is dead, God is dead
God is dead, God is dead, right?


But still the voices in my head
Are telling me that God is dead
The blood pours down, the rain turns red

Now, the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
And the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
And the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
To leave you well alone

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

You never said you love me
And I don't believe you can
'Cause I saw you in a dream
And you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
And I tried to look the same
But now I've got to love ya
Tell me who have I to blame?

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong

Now, the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known

I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong

Now, the whole wide world is movin'
'Cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'Cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice
As I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
A love I've never known
I was born without you, baby
But my feelings were a little bit too strong
Just a little bit too strong2Embed 33 ContributorsSolitude Lyrics
My name it means nothing, my fortune is less
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on
Everything I possessed, now, they are gone
They are gone, they are gone...

Oh, where can I go to and what can I do?
Nothing can please me, only thoughts are of you
You just laughed when I begged you to stay
I've not stopped crying since you went away
You went away, you went away...

The world is a lonely place, you're on your own
Guess I will go home, sit down and moan
Crying and thinking is all that I do
Memories I have remind me of you
Of you, of you...You might also like25Embed 50 ContributorsThe Wizard Lyrics
Misty morning, clouds in the sky
Without warning, a wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Long grey cloak, tinkling bell

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by

Never talking
Just keeps walking
Spreading his magic

Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky they blast
Through the universe the engines whine
Could it be the end of man and time?
Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny, yeah

Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the black sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
Rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide

Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
Escape from brainwashed minds and pollution
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
Find another world where freedom waits, yeah
You might also like
Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
Where the sons of freedom make their home
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
Leave them to their future in their grave
Make a home where love is there to stay
Peace and happiness in every day12Embed",rock,male

We all came out to Montreux
On the Lake Geneva shoreline
To make records with a mobile
We didn't have much time
But Frank Zappa and the Mothers
Were at the best place around
But some stupid with a flare gun
Burned the place to the ground

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what, we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand
And sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
""Come lay with me and love me""
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveler
I looked for something new
In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

Can you remember, remember my name?
As I flow through your life
A thousand oceans I have flown
Oh-oh-oh
And cold, cold spirits of ice, ah, ah

I am the echo of your past

I am returning the echo of a point in time
And distant faces shine
A thousand warriors I have known
Oh, oh-oh-oh
And laughing as the spirits appear
All your life
Shadows of another day

And if you hear me talking on the wind
You've got to understand
We must remain perfect strangers
Ah, ah, ah, no
I know I must remain inside this silent well of sorrow

A strand of silver hanging through the sky
Touching more than you see
The voice of ages in your mind, oh-oh-oh

Past midnight I still see the land
People are saying the woman is damned
She makes you burn with a wave of her hand
The city's ablaze, the town's on fire
The woman's flames are reaching higher
We were fools, we called her a liar
All I hear is
""Burn!""

I didn't believe she was the devil's sperm
She said, ""Curse you all, you'll never learn""
""When I leave there's no return""
The people laughed till she said, ""Burn!""
Warning came, no one cared
Earth was shaking, we stood and stared
When it came no one was spared
Still I hear
""Burn!""

If you're leaving, close the door
I'm not expecting people, anymore
Hear me grieving, lying on the floor
Whether I'm drunk or dead
I really ain't too sure

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
And my world is pale
When a blind man cries
Lord, you know
There ain't a sadder tale


Had a friend once, in a room
Had a good time
But it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
We found a reason
For the things we had to do

I'm a blind man
I'm a blind man
Now my room is cold

A strange kind of woman
The kind that gets written down in history
Her name was Nancy
Her face was nothing fancy
She left a trail of happiness and misery

Everybody loved her
She loved everyone and gave them good return
I tried to take her
I even tried to break her
She said, ""I ain't for taking, won't you ever learn?""

I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
I spent my money as I took my turn
I want you, I need you, I got to be near you
Ooh, I got a strange kind of woman

She looked like a raver
But I could never please her
On Wednesday mornings boy, you can't go far
I couldn't get her
But things got better, she said
""Saturday nights from now on baby, you're my star""

I spent my money as I took my turn

Sweet Lucy was a dancer
But none of us would chance her
Because she was a samurai
She made electric shadows
Beyond our fingertips
And none of us could reach that high
She came on like a teaser
I had to touch and please her
Enjoy a little paradise
The log was in my pocket
When Lucy met the rocket
She never knew the reason why

I can't deny it
With that smile on her face
Oh, it's not the kill
It's the thrill of the chase

Feel it coming
It's knocking at the door
You know it's no good running
It's not against the law
The point of no return
Now you know the score
And now you're learning

Now she eases gently
From her Austin to her Bentley
Suddenly she feels so young

Come down, and waste away with me

I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when

Hold you in

Too alarmin' now to talk about
Take your pictures down and shake it out
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Don't the best of them bleed it out
While the rest of them peter out?
Truth or consequence, say it aloud
Use that evidence, race it around

There goes my hero
Watch him as he goes
There goes my hero
He's ordinary

Kudos, my hero
Leavin' all the best

Keep you in the dark, you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones go marchin' in again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are ever ready
Are you ready?
I'm finished makin' sense
Done pleading ignorance, that whole defense
Spinning infinity, boy
The wheel is spinnin' me, it's never ending, never ending
Same old story

What if I say I'm not like the others?
What if I say I'm not just another one of your plays?
You're the pretender
What if I say I will never surrender?

All my life, I've been searchin' for somethin'
Somethin' never comes, never leads to nothin'
Nothin' satisfies, but I'm gettin' close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long, I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most
Feel it come to life when I see your ghost

Come down, don't you resist
You've such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Somethin' to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find somethin' in there?
To give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one, hidden up my sleeve
One by one, hidden up my sleeve

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down

Will I find a believer?
Another one who believes?
Another one to deceive?

If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside

On and on, I got nothin' to hide

Hey, don't let it go to waste
I love it, but I hate the taste
Weight keepin' me down
Hey, don't let it go to waste

Leaves me with the feelin' that I feel the most

I've got another confession to make
I'm your fool
Everyone's got their chains to break
Holdin' you
Were you born to resist
Or be abused?

Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Is someone getting the best
The best, the best, the best of you?
Are you gone and on to someone new?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use
I was too weak to give in
Too strong to lose
My heart is under arrest again
But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death
But I can't choose
I swear I'll never give in
I refuse

Run and tell all of the angels, this could take all night
Think I need a devil to help me get things right
Hook me up a new revolution, 'cause this one is a lie
We sat around laughin' and watched the last one die

Now I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of lyin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

I think I'm done nursin' the patience, it can wait one night
I'd give it all away if you give me one last try
We'll live happily ever trapped if you just save my life
Run and tell the angels that everything's all right

Now I'm lookin' to the sky to save me, I'm lookin' for a sign of life
Lookin' for something to help me burn out bright
I'm lookin' for a complication, lookin' 'cause I'm tired of tryin'
Make my way back home when I learn to fly high

What have we done with innocence?
It disappeared with time, it never made much sense
Adolescent resident
Wasting another night on plannin' my revenge

One in ten

Don't wanna be your monkey wrench
One more indecent accident
I'd rather leave than suffer this
I'll never be your monkey wrench

All this time to make amends
What do you do when all your enemies are friends?
Now and then, I'll try to bend
Under pressure, wind up snapping in the end

Since I was always caged and now I'm free!

You believe there's something else
To relieve your emptiness
And you dream about yourself, and you bleed and breathe the air
And it's on and on and on and on and on

We will always have that chance
We can do this one more time

We can spin the sun around
And the stars will all come out

Out here
Barely see my breath
Surrounded
By jealousy and death
I can't be reached
Only had one call
Dragged underneath
Separate from you all
You all

This time
Lost my own return
In spite of
Everything I've learned
I hid my tracks
Spit out all my air
Slipped into cracks
Stripped of all my cares

I'm so tired
Sheep are counting me
No more struggle
No more energy
No more patient

On the morning of the first eviction
They carried out the wishes of the landlord and his son
Furniture's out on the sidewalk next to the family
That little piggie went to market so they're kicking out everyone

Forced removal of the people on the corner
Shelter and location
Everybody wants somewhere

The elected are such willing partners
Look who's buying all their tickets to the game
Development wants, development gets, it's official
Development wants this neighborhood gone so the city just wants the same

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know

Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold

Spent my days with a woman unkind
Smoked my stuff and drank all my wine
Made up my mind to make a new start
Going to California with an aching in my heart
Someone told me there's a girl out there
With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red, and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, mm...

The leaves are falling all around, time I was on my way
Thanks to you, I'm much obliged for such a pleasant stay
But now it's time for me to go, the autumn moon lights my way
For now I smell the rain, and with it pain, and it's headed my way
Ah, sometimes I grow so tired
But I know I've got one thing I got to do

Ramble on, and now's the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day
Ramble on, gotta find the queen of all my dreams

Got no time to for spreading roots
The time has come to be gone
And though ""Our health"" we drank a thousand times
It's time to ramble on

Ramble on, and now the time, the time is now
To sing my song, I'm going 'round the world, I gotta find my girl
On my way, I've been this way ten years to the day

The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all
Oh-oh

I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light

To bring the balance back
Bring it back

The sunlight blinds his eyes!

Should I fall out of love, my fire in the light
To chase a feather in the wind
Within the glow that weaves a cloak of delight
There moves a thread that has no end

For many hours and days that pass ever soon
The tides have caused the flame to dim
At last the arm is straight, the hand to the loom
Is this to end or just begin?

All of my love to you, now
All of my love, all of my love

Maybe more than enough
Oh darling, darling, darling; walk a while with me

Many times I've gazed along the open road

Many times I've wondered how much there is to know
Many dreams come true, and some have silver linings
I live for my dream and a pocketful of gold


Mellow is the man who knows what he's been missing
Many, many men can't see the open road
Many is a word that only leaves you guessing

She swore that she would be all mine and love me 'til the end

But from her eyes, a different smile like that of one who knows

The best years of my life gone by, here I am alone and blue
Some people cry and some people die by the wicked ways of love
But I'll just keep on rollin' along with the grace of the Lord above

People talkin all around 'bout the way you left me flat
I don't care what the people say, I know where their jive is at

Polly wants a cracker
I think I should get off her first
I think she wants some water
To put out the blow torch

Let me take a ride, cut yourself
Want some help, please myself
Got some rope, have been told
Promise you, have been true

Maybe she would like some food
She asked me to untie her
A chase would be nice for a few

Pass it back and forth

With eyes so dilated, I've become your pupil
You taught me everything without a poison apple

You're face to face
With the man who sold the world

I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home

For years and years, I roamed
I gazed a gazeless stare
We walked a million hills

Calling all comas
Prisoner on the loose; description
The spitting image of me
Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake and tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prisoner of sleep, deeper down
The rabbit hole, never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone; feelings
Raw and exposed
When I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
Or dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in as I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing, no longer exist

Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole never to be found

Face down in the boulevard, yet I couldn't face you

Your friends, they all sympathize, maybe I don't need them to

Instead, I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, ""Boy, if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new
Do you know who you really are, are you sure it's really you?""
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie

Is love mental disease or lucky fever dream?

You wanna know if I know why? I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye, or how one becomes two
And I just can't recall what started it all, or how to begin in the end
I ain't here to break it, just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

I wanna make it, I wanna make it wit chu
(Anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it, (Again and again) I wanna make it wit chu

Sometimes the same is different, but mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life that jus' ain't my thing
If I told you that I knew about the sun and the moon, I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure is what I wanna do
Anytime, anywhere, and I say, babe

I want God to come and take me home
'Cause I'm all alone in this crowd
Who are you to me? Who am I supposed to be?
Not exactly sure anymore, mmm
Where's this going to? Can I follow through?
Or just follow you for a while?

Does anyone ever get this right?
I feel no love

Ain't no confusion here, it is as I've feared
The illusion that you feel is real
To be vulnerable is needed most of all
If you intend to truly fall apart

You think the worst of all is far behind
The vampire of time and memories
Has died, I survived

Your heart is like a fortress
You keep your feelings locked away
Is it easier?
Does it make you feel safe?
You wander through the darkness
Of wilderness behind your eyes
I know you’re afraid
But you gotta move on

Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and come through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe

I believe I know you
Yet, I don't truly know myself
I pray you won't feel as alone as I have felt

It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through
If ever your fortress caves
You're always safe in mine

The Earth spins 'round the sun
And behold
Everything happens
Every night falls prey to sunrise

If your fortress is under siege
You can always run to me
If your fortress is under siege
You can always run
Every fortress falls
It is not the end
It ain't if you fall
But how you rise that says
Who you really are
So get up and go through

Everyone, it seems
Has somewhere to go
And the faster the world spins
The shorter the lights will glow
And I'm swimming in the night
Chasing down the moon
The deeper in the water
The more I long for you

Most of what you see, my dear, is purely for show
Because not everything that goes around comes back around, you know
Holdin' on too long is just a fear of letting go
Because not everything that goes around comes back around, you know
One thing that is clear, it's all downhill from here


The love line in your hand
Cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone
Crumble in the light

Most of what you see, my dear, is worth letting go
Because not everything that goes around comes back around, you know
Holdin' on too long is just a fear of what to show
Because not everything that goes around comes back around, you know
Not everything that goes around comes back around, you know
One thing that is clear, it's all downhill from here

Got my own theme music, plays whenever I yawn
Fear is the hand that pulls your strings
A useless toy, pitiful plaything

In every way, everyday

The wait is long and heavy too
Despite what you're accustomed to
I know that life moves on, that's what scares me so
Have no intentions of letting go

Only us, no one in the world

I better do something, move earth and sky
And patiently, sweetly, with all of my might
I sing only for you
To the beat of my footsteps in the night

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on

There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
What's done is done until you do it again
Life in pursuit of a nameless prey

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game

Held a general's rank

No colours anymore, I want them to turn black

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue

No sweeping exits or offstage lines
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
And he's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no, oh no, no, no!
Hey, hey, hey! That's what I'll say!

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try, and I try, and I try, and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no

When I'm watching my TV
And a man comes on and tells me
How white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, oh no, no, no

Work hard and say it's easy, do it just to please me

One shot is never enough
I just wait for us to go in circles
A lifetime of giving my all for you
(Hostile, give me a break
Don't say it's in the bottle of air)

And first, he would tell me I'm his friend
Actually, no thanks, I'm okay
And then he would send weird looks my way

I want new friends, but they don't want me
They're making plans while I watch TV
Thought it was you, but maybe it's me
I want new friends, but they don't want me

And the '80s song, yeah, how did it go?
When they said, ""This is the beginning of the best years""

We started living in an old house

It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun, and it was 1981

We named him 'Baby', he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long, because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

Now we're a family, and we're alright now
We got money, and a little place to fight now
We don't know you, and we don't owe you
But if you see us around, I got something else to show you

Well the answer may come in the caring voice of a friend, a chance encounter with a book, or from a personal faith.  For Janet, help came from her faith, but it also came from a squirrel.  Shortly after her divorce, Janet lost her father then she lost her job, she had mounting money problems.  But Janet not only survived, she worked her way out of despondency and now she says, life is good again.  How could this happen?  She told me that late one autumn day when she was at her lowest she watched a squirrel storing up nuts for the winter, one at a time he would take them to the nest.  And she thought, if that squirrel can take care of himself with a harsh winter coming on, so can I.  Once I broke my problems into small pieces, I was able to carry them, just like those acorns, one at a time

Take all your problems and rip 'em apart
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Carry them off in a shopping cart
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Another thing you should've known from the start
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
The problems in hand are lighter than at heart
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Be like the squirrel, girl, be like the squirrel
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Give it a whirl, girl, be like the squirrel
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
And another thing you have to know in this world
Oh, oh, ah-oh-oh
Cut up your hair, straighten your curls
Well, your problems hide in your curls

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

I was watching
With one eye on the other side
I had fifteen people telling me to move
I got moving on my mind
I found shelter
In some thoughts turning wheels around
I said 39 times that I love you
To the beauty I had found

Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy

I been thinking
Of a little place down by the lake
They got a dirty old road leading up to the house
I wonder how long it will take 'til we're alone
Sitting on the front porch of that home
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards
Never gotta worry about locking the door

For me to think childish thoughts like these
But I'm so tired of acting tough
And I'm gonna do what I please
Let's get married
In a big cathedral by a priest
'Cause if I'm the man that you love the most
You could say 'I do' at least

Well, it's 1, 2, 3, 4
Take the elevator
At the Hotel Yorba
I'll be glad to see you later
All they got inside is vacancy
And it's 4, 5, 6, 7

I saw you standing in the corner
On the edge of a burning light
I saw you standing in the corner

Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night

You make me feel a little older
Like a full grown woman might
But when you're gone I grow colder

Come to me again in the cold, cold night
In the cold, cold night

I hear you walking by my front door
I hear the creaking of the kitchen floor
I don't care what other people say
I'm going to love you, anyway

Come to me again in the cold, cold night

You will know that it's warm inside
And you'll come run to me

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

Jack, give me some money to pay my bills
All the dough I give you, Holly, you've been using on pain pills
Jack, will you call me if you're able?
I got your phone number written in the back of my Bible

Jack, I think you're pulling my leg
And I think maybe I better ask Meg
Meg, do you think Jack really loves me?
You know I don't care, 'cause Jack really bugs me
Why don't you ask him now?
Well I would, but Meg, I really just don't know how

Just say, “Jack, do you adore me?”
Well I would Holly, but love really bores me
Then I guess we should just be friends
I'm just kidding Holly, you know that I'll love you 'til the end

Well it's true that we love one another

Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

Holly give me some of your English lovin'
If I did that Jack I'd have one in the oven
Why don't you go off and love yourself?
If I did that Holly, there won't be anything left for anybody else
Jack, it's too bad about the way that you look
You know I gave that horse a carrot so he'd break your foot
Will the two of you cut it out?
And tell 'em what it's really all about

Well it's true that we love one another
I love Jack White like a little brother
Well Holly I love you too
But there's just so much that I don't know about you

That was good (Jolly good)
Was that jolly good? (Yeah, very nice)
Jolly good, cup of tea then, Bruce

If you think that a kiss is all in the lips
C'mon, you got it all wrong, man
And if you think that our dance was all in the hips
Oh well, then do the twist
If you think holding hands is all in the fingers
Grab hold of the soul where the memory lingers and
Make sure to never do it with the singer
'Cause he'll tell everyone in the world
What he was thinking about the girl
Yeah, what he's thinking about the girl, oh

A lot of people get confused and they bruise
Real easy when it comes to love
They start putting on their shoes and walking out
And singing ""boy, I think I had enough""
Just because she makes a big rumpus
She don't mean to be mean or hurt you on purpose, boy
Take a tip and do yourself a little service
Take a mountain turn it into a mole
Just by playing a different role
Yeah, by playing a different role, oh

The boat, yeah, you know she's rockin' it
And the truth, well, ya know there's no stoppin' it
Ah, the boat, yeah, you know they're still rockin' it
And the truth, well, you know there's no stoppin' it

So what, somebody left you in a rut
And wants to be the one who's in control
But the feeling that you're under can really make you wonder
How the hell she can be so cold
So now you're mad, denying the truth
And it's hidden in the wisdom in the back of your tooth
Ya need ta spit it out, in a telephone booth
While ya call everyone that you know, and ask 'em
Where do you think she goes
Oh yeah, where d'ya suppose she goes, oh

The truth, well, you know there's no stoppin' it
And the boat, well, you know she's still rockin' it, yeah
The boat, well, you know she's still rockin' it
And the truth, yeah, you know there's no stoppin' it

You recognize the effect and the wreck
That it's causin' when she rocks the boat
But it's the clause hidden in the Cardinal Laws
'bout the proper place to hang her coat
So to you, the truth is still hidden
And the soul plays the role of a lost little kitten but
You should know that the doctors weren't kiddin'
She's been singing it all along
But you were hearin' a different song
Yeah you were hearin' a different song
But you were hearin' a different song4Embed 19 ContributorsThere’s No Home for You Here Lyrics
Ahhhh
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here

I'd like to think that all of this constant interaction
Is just the kind to make you drive yourself away
Each simple gesture done by me is counteracted
And leaves me standing here with nothing else to say
Completely baffled by a backward indication
That an inspired word will come across your tongue
Hands moving upward to propel the situation
Have simply halted
Now the conversation's done

There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here
There's no home for you here girl, go away
There's no home for you here

I'm only waiting for the proper time to tell you
That it's impossible to get along with you
It's hard to look you in the face when we are talking
So it helps to have a mirror in the room
I've not been really looking forward to the performance
But there's my cue and there's a question on your face
Fortunately I have come across an answer
Which is go away
And do not leave a trace

Breaking baubles
Throwing garbage
Drinking soda
Looking happy
Taking pictures

It can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love

Sure I'm C.F.K
But you gotta love me
The cost no man can say
But you gotta love me

Well I'm sorry but I'm not
Interested in gold mines
Oil wells, shipping or real estate
What would I liked to have been?
Everything you hate

It can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love

There is a man
A certain man
And for the poor you may be sure
That he'll do all he can
Who is this one?
Whose favorite son?
Just by his action has the traction
Magnates on the run
Who likes to smoke?
Enjoys a joke?
And wouldn't get a bit
Upset if he were really broke?
With wealth and fame
He's still the same
I'll bet you five you're not alive

And there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it

Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way
To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue
And you'll be there when she finds someone new
What to do?
Well you know

You keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
And she thought she was sure by the way you two could have fun
But now she might leave like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'Cause you want

But now you're scared, you think she's running away
You search in your hand for something clever to say;
""Don't go away""

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers

But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is
(Come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (Changes)
Things'll never be the same
That's just the way it is (That's the way it is, what?)
Aww, yeah (Hear me)
(Oh my, oh my, come on, come on)
That's just the way it is (That's just the way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same
(Never be the same, yeah, yeah, yeah, aww, yeah)
That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is
(Uh)
That's just the way it is (Just the way it is, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Things'll never be the same (Yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is)
Aww, yeah (Some things will never change, oh my)
(I'm tryna make a change)
(You're my brother, you're my sister, yeah)
That's just the way it is (The way it is, the way it is)
Things'll never be the same (You're my brother, you're my sister)
That's just the way it is, aww, yeah
Some things'll never change345Embed 257 ContributorsKeep Ya Head Up Lyrics
Little something for my godson Elijah
And a little girl named Corin
Some say the blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
I say the darker the flesh, then the deeper the roots (Oh)
I give a holla to my sisters on welfare
2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one
So will the real men get up?
I know you're fed up, ladies, but keep ya head up

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up
(Keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter
(Oh-oh, keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things are gonna get easier
(Keep-keep ya head up)
Ooh, child, things'll get brighter

And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders
While the rich kids is drivin' Benz
I'm still tryin' to hold on to survivin' friends (Oh, yeah)
And it's crazy, it seems it'll never let up
But, huh, please, you got to keep your head up206Embed 294 ContributorsTranslationsEnglishAzərbaycanca / آذربايجانHail Mary Lyrics

Makaveli in this, Killuminati
All through your body
The blow is like a 12-Gauge shotty
Uh, feel me!
(Come with me; Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see)
And God said he should send his one begotten son
(What do we have here now? Do you wanna ride or die?)
To lead the wild into the ways of the man
Follow me! (La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la)
Eat my flesh, flesh of my flesh!

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
La, la-da-la-la-la-la-la

I ain't a killer, but don't push me
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to gettin' pussy
Picture paragraphs unloaded, wise words bein' quoted
Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
Much too hardened for a smile, way too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Bail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!
Come with me!

They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary (Hail Mary)
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty

You are appreciated

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

In the city of good ol' Watts
In the city, the city of Compton
We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And, uh) And my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no), 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous, 'cause deep in they hearts they wanna be me

It was my only wish to rise above these jealous
Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go), give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So I open fire until you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama), come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)
When it's time to die, then be a man and pick the way you leave (Yeah, nigga)
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions

Straight to the depths of Hell is where those cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me

Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player
'Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, 'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies

Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb

Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks

Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay
My little homie G, can't you see I'm buster-free?
Niggas can't stand me; all eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

The feds is watchin', niggas plottin' to get me
Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law
Bitches, I fuck with a passion, I'm livin' rough and raw
Catchin' cases at a fast rate, ballin' in the fast lane
Hustle 'til the mornin', never stopped until the cash came
Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live my life as a boss player, 'cause even gettin' high
These niggas got me tossin' shit
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit
Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber
The money is mandatory, the hoes is for the stress
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with a bulletproof vest
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket, get your money
Motherfucker, let's get rich and we'll kick it; all eyes on me
Live the life as a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life as a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me
All eyes on me
Live the life of a thug nigga until the day I die
Live the life of a boss player 'cause even gettin' high
All eyes on me

Pay attention, my niggas! See how that shit go?
Nigga walk up in this motherfucker and it be like, ""Bing!""
Cops, bitches, every-motherfuckin'-body
(Live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
(Live my life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)
I got bustas, hoes, and police watchin' a nigga, you know?
(I live my life as a thug nigga until the day I die)
(Livin' life as a boss playa, 'cause even gettin' high)
He he he, it's like what they think
I'm walkin' around with some ki's in my pocket or somethin'
They think I'm goin' back to jail, they really on that dope

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Eh, light that up, Snoop! Why you actin' like that?
Ahh shit, you done fucked up now
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
You done put two of America's most wanted
In the same motherfuckin' place at the same motherfuckin' time?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Ha, ha, ha, ha, y'all niggas about to feel this
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
Break out the champagne glasses and the motherfuckin' condoms
Have one on us, a'ight?
(Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party)
A toast to the gangsters

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
Bombin' hoochies with precision, my intention's to get richer
With the S-N double-O-P, Dogg, my fuckin' homie
You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome
""Free 2Pac"" is all that's on a nigga's mind
But at the same time, it seems they tryin' to take mine
So I'ma get smart and get defensive and shit
And put together a Million March for some gangsta shit

Two multi-millionaire motherfuckers catchin' cases
Bitches, get ready for the throw down, the shit's about to go down
Me and Snoop about to clown
I'm losin' my religion, I'm vicious on these stool pigeons
You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerino
I've got a house out in the hills, right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now, follow as we ride!
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside!
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it

Release me to the streets, and keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffery is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee
These niggas must be crazy, what?!
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers, who can fade the thug?
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like, Cuh, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga, Dogg, and me, eternally the most wanted

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye

Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?

Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space

You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean?
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks, you not gon' say, ""Damn, look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete""
You gon' be like, ""Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!""
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin, ""Damn, he did this, he did this,""
Just be like, ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin...

When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
It, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared...
The rose that grew from concrete

When no one else, even cared

Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet (to breathe the fresh air)
It came from concrete (to breathe the fresh air)
(to breathe the fresh air, to breathe the fresh air)

You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are
My damaged petals. Don't ask me why, thank God nigga, ask me how!

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen' and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha

Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha

Only God can judge me (That right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (Nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (Really)
Only God can judge me now

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use in tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix

Flatline
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me

Let me live, baby, let me live

Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them Buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss some boss player shit with 4-Tay

Between you and Biggie it was like, who's gon’—who’s gon’— who rules the nigga kingdom and shit, basically, you know what I'm saying? I was like, this is like a fucking
It is that
Election. It’s an election and shit
It is that
You know what I am saying?
Me and Biggie's situation is smaller than that. Me and Biggie’s situation is like…
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
(You don't know?)
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
Check it, I grew up a fuckin' screw-up
Got introduced to the game, got a ounce and fuckin' blew up
Choppin' rocks overnight
The nigga Biggie Smalls tryna turn into the black Frank White
We had to grow dreads to change our description
Two cops is on the milk box missin'
Show they toes, you know they got stepped on
A fistful of bullets, a chest full of Teflon
Run from the police, picture that
Nigga, I'm too fat, I fuck around and catch a asthma attack
That's why I bust back, it don't faze me
When he drop, take his Glock and I'm Swayze
Celebrate my escape, sold the Glock, bought some weight
Lay back, I got some money to make, motherfucker

Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?
(It's on me)
But still I'm havin' memories of high speed when the cops crashed
As I laugh, pushin' the gas while my Glocks blast
We was young and we was dumb, but we had heart
In the dark, will we survive through the bad parts?
Many dreams is what I had, and plenty wishes
No hesitation in extermination of these snitches
Envious bitches, they still continue to pursue me
A couple of movies, now the whole world's tryna screw me
Even the cops tried to sue me, so what can I do?
But stay true, sippin' 22's of brew
And now media is tryna test me
Got the press askin' questions, tryna stress me
Misery is all I see, that's my mind state
My history with the police will shake the crime rate
My main man had two strikes, slipped, got arrested, and flipped
He screamed ""Thug Life!"" and emptied the clip
Got tired of runnin' from the police
You know, I wonder if they'll laugh when I'm dead
Why am I fighting to live if I'm just living to fight?
Why am I trying to see when there ain't nothing in sight?
Why am I trying to give when no one gives me a try?
Why am I dying to live if I'm just living to die?

They wanted a new regime. And my regime includes East coast, includes West coast

I was more shocked than anything
You know what I'm sayin'?
But I wasn't more shocked of him dying
I was more shocked of him… Pac is a strong dude, yo
I know dude, you know what I'm sayin'? Real strong
So when they was like he got shot, I was just more like, ""Again?"" you know what I'm sayin'?
He always getting shot, or shot at
He going to pull through this one again
Make a few records about it, and it's going to be over
You know what I'm sayin'?
But when he, when he died, I was just like, ""whoa"", you know what I'm saying? Kinda took me by
I mean, even though we was going through our drama
I would never wish death on nobody
You know what I'm sayin'?
Because there ain't no coming back from that91Embed 173 ContributorsMe Against the World Lyrics
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth
It's just me against the world, baby
You might also like
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
'Cause it's just me against the world, baby (Hey)
Me against the world (Ooh yeah)
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose

Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself, see
Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well
Me against the world
With nothin' to lose (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it70Embed 101 ContributorsDo For Love Lyrics
Turn it up loud
Hahaha, ahahaha, hey man
You a little sucker for love, Pac!
Word up, hahahahaha

I should've seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
You might also like
Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy
You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy
Don’t wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I’m back
To makin promises to you, tryin' to keep it true
What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin' low, losin’ control
My heart is sayin’ leave, oh, what a tangled web we weave
When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear, 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the door
Never no more will you see me, this is the end
'Cause now I know you’ve been cheatin', I’m a sucka for love
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision, 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, (Do for love)
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
Do for love, yeah baby yeah

The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see the P!
You must be goin' blind

Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes, open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe? Nigga, you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
You screamin', ""Go 2Pac!"" and I ain't stoppin' till I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now, nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me!

The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me

My shit be poppin' out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga, what? It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me!

Niggas can't see me
They can't see me
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Oh!! Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me!

Yo, check this out: stay off his dick

Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me

I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face
But you still can't see me

Don't believe everything you read! Alizé and weed
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me

It's all about you (Yeah, I'm gon' say it's all about you
But you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)

You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh at how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it? (Hell no)
Addicted to the things you do

I make a promise if you go with me
Just let me know, I'll have you hollerin' my name out before I leave
Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep though, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go

Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya
At the most, I fucked a bitch from the West Coast to West Virginia

Then I flip the channel, I'm checkin' out my homeboy 2Pac video
I see the same bitch that was in my video
You know what I'm sayin'? And then, you know what I'm sayin'?

Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy,
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""Bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down

I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Ahh, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come
Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

Lord knows I, tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears (God please help me)

Lord, I lost so many years (I suffered through the years)
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears80Embed",rap,male

Honey, check it out, you got me mesmerized
With your black hair and your fat-ass thighs
Street poetry is my everyday
But yo, I gotta stop when you trot my way
If I was workin' at the club, you would not pay
Ayo, my man Phife Diggy, he got somethin' to say

I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian (Uh)
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little somethin' on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talkin' 'bout you, yo, I took you out
But sex was on my mind for the whole damn route
My mind was in a frenzy and a horny state

Stretch out your legs, let me make you bawl
Drive you insane, drive you up the wall
Starin' at your dome-piece, very strong
Stronger than pride, stronger than Teflon
Take you on the Ave and you buy me links
Now I wanna pound the poontang until it stinks
You can be my mama and I'll be your boy

Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood (What?)
But hun, you got the goods like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik, the Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week?
She simply said, ""No,"" labeled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hun, I don't get down like that
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep' in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture
Shaheed, Phife, and the Extra P
Stacy Beadle, PJ, and my man LG
They know the Abstract is really soul on ice
The character is of men, never ever of mice
Shorty, let me tell you 'bout my only vice
It has to do with lots of lovin' and it ain't nothin' nice

We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go
You might also like
The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars

You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block
Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

All you Black folks, you must go
All you Mexicans, you must go
And all you poor folks, you must go
Muslims and gays, boy, we hate your ways
So all you bad folks, you must go50Embed 207 ContributorsScenario Lyrics
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

Ayo, Bo knows this (What?) And Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot, so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say, ""The Tribe can't flow""
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (Yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meanin' from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know
You might also like
Yes, yes, y'all! (Yes, y'all!)
Who got the vibe? It's the Tribe, y'all! (Tribe, y'all!), real live, y'all! (Live, y'all!)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that?) Broooown!
So may I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
Contact!
Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom bip
With a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down for the flex
Next it's the textbook, old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario?

(True, blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, an -eader! Simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see you later
Later (Later!) Later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her
So, yo, the D, what, the O
Incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight, laugh
Yo, how'd that sound? (Oooh!)
It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left, 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime, so I ain't no criminal!
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did
I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causin' rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear (You know I did it)
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not braggin', tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary when diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eatin' Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh, uh
Ugh, ugh, ugh! All over the track, man
Ugh, pardon me, ugh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers, 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smellin' rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo (Yeah, my man, motherfucker)
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love
As the Tribe flies high like a dove

Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major
Yes, the Tribe of the game we're the player
As you inhale like a breath of fresh air

Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, check the rhyme

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me, the Five Footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
Heh, okay, you on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack, that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard

Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
Um, let me see... damn, I can't remember

So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent Black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm...
Well, it's kinda simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty;
Record company people are shady
So kids, watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well, off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper—what you say, Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half-step cause I'm not a half-stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two-inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling an MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

Buggin' out, buggin' out, buggin' out, you're buggin' out

We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher
And after the horns, you can check out the Phifer

Competition dem try fe come side way
But competition they must come straight way
How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh), so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store, and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged (huh?) by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too (ha-ha)
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)
So the new shit can rock (uh), from Bronx to Massapequa (uh)
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew (yeah), and peace to this crew (Yeah)
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask

It’s time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures

To make something happen, to make something happen
To make something happen, let’s make something happen

Word to Phifer
Gonna bring it to the overlord, drinkin' Cisco
Chilling with the gold microphone cords
And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour
'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war
We about our business, we not quitters
Not bullshitters, we deliver—we go-get it
Don’t be bitter 'cause we not just niggas
Jarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth
Ain’t nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off
Hardest spit in the city y’all niggas spitting kitten soft
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost
They planning for our future, people
None of our people involved
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off
It always seems the poorest persons
Are people forsaken, dawg
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons
On the captain's log
They’d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it’s happening, you feel it y’all?
Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going
Reputation ain’t glowing, reparations ain’t flowing
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in
And the car stereo where they would promote the show

Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways
And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Carolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can’t breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it
Would even think to throw you a bone?
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Nah cypher, probably no place to

People, give your ears, so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies, act like gems
Sit down Indian style as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the '80s, J.B.s on ""The Promo""
In my never-endin' quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin' it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second, son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a Black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove, but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So who that, do that, do-do that, that, that (Come on)
Who that, do that, do-do that, that, that (Yeah, okay)
Do that, do that, do-do that, that, that
I'm buggin' out, but let me get back, 'cause I'm wettin' niggas
So run and tell the others, 'cause we are the brothers
I learned how to build mics in my workshop class
So give me this award and let's not make it the last

Back in '89, I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was bustin' rhymes, but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So, Shaheed, come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy?
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch, baby, never comin' less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dance floor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Comin' with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Livin' mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make somethin' def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Seven times out of ten, we listen to our music at night
Thus spawned the title of this program
The word maraud means to loot
In this case, we maraud for ears45Embed 83 ContributorsExcursions Lyrics
Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, ""Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael""
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that 
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half

""Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—""

We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu 
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

""—time is running out on black power advocates in the day and white thighed supporters at night

Conrad Tokyo, Sapporo, pistachio
Just done mash a show, Dawg is off on sabbatical
Rather watch the Nixon shit than politicians politic
CNN and all this shit, gwaan yo, move with the fuckery
Trump and the SNL hilarity
Troublesome times kid, no times for comedy
Blood clot, you doing, bullshit you spewing
As if this country ain't already ruined
In lieu of these mumbling, fumbling
Swearing they're the greatest
Online they debate us, if we different, then we're haters
We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food
The nucleus is here now (ooo)

Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men
Just embrace it and die alone, song of Revelation
Reverends and cattles racing
Devils and demons and Deuteronomy
Fumigate our economy, 'lluminate broken dreams
And manifest all insanity, look around

Handle rocks with the capital G, ball on the beat
Status, Chris Paul and John Wall in the league
Grabbin' mics till the knuckles would bleed
('Cause I believe
The potent that I'm quoting will have you geeked like speed)
If rationale is naturale or a weave
It's all edges and peas
Settin' press, we on a permanent steeze
I'm in a world where my princess is Leia
And she's feeling my Vader
And my lure grows greater and greater
Chem trails, droppin' poisonous vapors
Have you shaking like Gator
Been trill, nigga, process the data
Blu-ray, wave file, or a Beta, I'll DVR it for later
Kappo Masa with a G to my waiter
You can't define us, XY us, or Z us
You generational elitists
Have your chi in virtual think pieces
(See, these written words are poetical science
Brain's defiant, thoughts heavy, baby
They're a major appliance)Leave a dent when drop with the flyness, fluent giant
Dude's nice, he tight, screwed in with some pliers
Cool with some buyers
Yeah, nigga, cool with some growers
(Never no tattletales, only I don't knowers)
We a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us
So listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing
Mouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise
Dudes rude and as useless as coins, shoot 'em boys

Aiyo, put one up for the Phifer, long time no hear from
Suckers walkin' around talkin' about they could get some
But that vibe is non-cypher, no can do
And if you take I fi' joke, then ask the other two
And I proceed to let you know, exactly how to flow
I'm not Lawn Doctor so just seckle with the hoe
Oops... my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex
I got the riches, the bitches, I'm large like a Huxtable
You think you're all that, but your girl's quite doable!
Yeah, I'm tellin' you G, to back up off me

Save all the sad songs and the tearjerkers
Niggas, step back, it's the lyrical worker
The poems that I create ain't in paperback books
The poems that I create are for hookers and the crooks
My mental is excellin' 'cause I dabble in the books
I'm not the one to front on, so suboops-suboops
Yo, I gets the pickin's, I'm such a damn Dickens
If you step to this then the plot just thickens
I'll run you around the track like a bunny and a dog
To me, your just another MC on the log
A link in the chain, fluid on the brain
I boast of hype lyrics, and yours are mundane
See, I can't maintain, especially if you come back
I'm the lyrical master blaster, yeah, I could do that
I could also do your girl, so leave the hoe at home
'Cause when I get done, I'll have her strung on bones
It's the no-joke pressure that elevates my mind
Make me pick up and go when it's time to drop my rhymes
My title is rock, the Abstract Poetic
I'm in the idle mode but my energy's kinetic
So smooth and debonair, special for the ear
Gotta keep my thing in gear
'Cause it's evident and clear that I will rock, rock, rock...

Off top on the spot, no reading from your Whackberry

Now, you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look at what you're starting
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant

Speakin' of which..
Got a leash and I wish just to rock you, Miss (C'mon)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (What?)
End of the day, you're not mad at me (Ugh)
Not dealin' with nobody, now that's what you told me (What?)
I said, ""Hey, yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly"" (C'mon)
'Cause yo, picture me messin' it up
Her mind not corrupt, with the ill C-cups
Shit! I'm on my J.O. (C'mon)

Got me like a friend, what confuses me though
Is kisses when we breeze, tell me what's the deal, yo?

I ain't even gon' lie, I was probably high
Just forgot to call you back, simple as that
I ain't no almanac, so lick my dictionary
I might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary
Yellow accents on a dark bitch
I met her back when she kept all her carpet
I'm well aware all that shit is fantasy
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B
That's demeanor, momma's mannerisms
That mean, don't mean to get vulgar, but it's some
Hoes in this bitch like a box of donuts
It's cold out in this bitch, standing on the corner
Condolences to niggas that got erased
I pour out some liquor on a cop's grave
Mmm, digital church bells

And my mom and my pop, they just grin
And empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens

In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids
Fuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up
They stood on the corner
Like you once upon a, time
And probably felt like a loner
And smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning
Complaining that you always moaning
Never saying good morning
Storming out my house
And slamming doors like you paying bills
They been through it too, though
They were kids like you, though
But what if they knew though
And hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing, no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court
With no high percentage shot
Just a bunch of, ""You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got""
Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht
But ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking
I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty
Shit, their blood pressure high, why?
They don't play no more, probably

Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh, uh-uh, uh
Uh-uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh-uh

Listen up, everybody, the bottom line
I'm a Black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just livin' like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot
Jalick, Jalick, ya wind up ya hip
Draftin' of the poets, I'm the number seven pick (Uh)
Licks, licks, licks, boy, pon your backside (Uh)
Licks, licks, licks, boy, pon your backside (Uh)
Listen to the fader, Shaheed lets it glide
Tip the earthly body, Heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy (Phife)

One for the treble, two for the bass
You know the style, Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eatin' booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case, I own more condoms than TLC
Now the formula is this, Me, Tip and Ali
For those who can't count, it goes one-two-three
The anti— (Damn, right I'm s—) big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do, but never me
Some brothers try to diss, but Malik, you see 'em bitchin'?
Me nah care about dem dibby MC, my shit is hittin'
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr. Energetic, who me sound pathetic?
When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?
I don't know, man, I don't know, man, I don't know, man
I don't know, I don't know (Uh)

-gy

1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter

It's like butter, like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turned to freaks
All of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, ""Diane made it""
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
'Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers

""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack

It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame

Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?

So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)

You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed 755 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschLose Yourself Lyrics
Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

I'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall

Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(New-ooh, ooh-ooh) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—

Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'

I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yuh)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)
You might also like
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys
So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice808Embed 852 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolРусскийPortuguêsItalianoFrançaisThe Ringer Lyrics
*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date"" — ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleanersYou might also like736Embed 317 ContributorsTranslationsDeutschTürkçeFrançaisРусскийPortuguêsالعربيةEnglishMockingbird Lyrics
Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream

Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)406Embed 514 ContributorsTranslationsTürkçeEspañolРусскийPortuguêsBahasa MelayuItalianoFrançaisفارسیEnglishVenom Lyrics

Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida

Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man

'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo, left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo, left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo, left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?

I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Give out from underneath me)

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(Until the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Give out from underneath me)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(Until the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Give out from underneath me)

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am
You might also like
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
River (Ooh), river run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
River (Ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain

You want me to tell you something?
Uh-huh

'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

‘Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you

Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl
First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go

Y'all blowin' smoke as if y'all ain't washed
I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me (What up?)
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons
I'd rather try to buy the moon and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tires new
The Maserati white and cool like G-Eazy
Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)
I'm confused tryna figure out
How to do Kapri Styles and Mya G

Prolly rob these little dudes at fist point

I'm into stuff like doublin' commas
Find me a brother who's solid
To count this shit up and then bust this shit down
When the cops hit us up, we can flush this shit down
We cannot give a fuck, shit, a fuckin' colonic
Sellin' your cock and your butt for a follow or
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff
Now you slippin', call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin' the charts
To dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless
If you've got it and you do not acknowledge it

And I'm talkin' to you
But you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss
But keep commenting on my daughter Hailie
I keep on telling motherfuckers
But, just in case you forgot really and need Ja memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple apricot jelly
I respond rarely, but this time Shady 'bout to sound off
Like a fuckin' cocked semi-Glock Demigod
Let me put a fuckin' silencer on this little
Non-threatening blond fairy cornball takin' shots at me
You're not ready, fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew
Obviously, I'm not getting through
We can get it poppin' like Redenbach, letting off like Remy Ma
Heavy artille—ry, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell
With a motherfucking heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I lost
You'll be talkin' 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off of ya
Better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch, this shit don't fly in our city
Punk, you don't disrespect OGs, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me
That I'd be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over
I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hanging open
My code name is groper, I role play with lotion
I fucked on the world then I throw away the Trojan
Old lederhosen with home-made explosives
I'll blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I O. J. the flows
And I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm throat spray and Motrin, I throated Nicole
As they both there to choke and my whole blade is soakin'
A double-edge sword, it cuts both ways, I poke and
I stick and I turn in a rotating motion
Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle to sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fucking invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick
A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical ('Dentical!)—but not us
The only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other
None come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older
Sponge, mug, folder, nun, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug, roaster
Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster (Yeah!)

Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!
The art of MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways

To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away (Woo)

Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake

Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Haha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I'ma have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew (Ah!)
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the Hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (Yeah)
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three’s not a crowd all up in it

Now, everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up and follow me!
Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up! Look, look
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin' here screaming, ""Fuck the Free World!""
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go a cappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!
I'm a piece of fucking white trash, I say it proudly
And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

Damn
Forgot to do somethin', let me see, uh
Oh, yeah— it ain't over, motherfuckers
The motherfuckin' saga continues
Y'all motherfuckers ready for N.W.A? Well, get the fuck up
A bitch is a bitch, so if you're poor—
It was once said by a man who couldn't quit, dope—
Ice Cube writes the rhymes that I say
But now, since he stepped the fuck off
Here's what they think about you
That punk Ice Cube—
Here's what they think about you
Cube was suckin' so much New York dick
Here's what they think about you
Real niggas? Them niggas Dre and Yella used to wear lipstick and lace
Here's what they think about you
Why y'all let his punk ass in the group
Here's what they think about you
When they was in London, they wasn't no good without fuckin' Ice Cube
Here's what they think about you
When I bought the tape, all I know is I wanted my motherfuckin' money back
Here's what they think about you

Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all motherfuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas, now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who you foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ayy, yo, Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you been a dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
'Cause you know I'm the one that flow
You done run a hundred miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
'Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Now you're getting done without Vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big bank take little bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
'Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Nah, cut them balls
'Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a motherfucking ready teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
'Cause he's going out like Kunta Kinte
But I got a whip for you, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide and conquer
'Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
'Cause I remember when you drove a B210
Broke as a motherfucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the first team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh, yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no Vaseline
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done— get— getting done
Now you're getting done without Va— Va— Va— Va— Vaseline

I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
I never have dinner with the president
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E would be hanging from a tree
With no Vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
'Til that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking 'bout?
Get rid of that devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
'Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white Jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play The Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you

Shit
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Uh

Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And mama cooked the breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another twenty-four?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day (Shit)

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
'Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the seven, seven-eleven, seven-eleven, seven, even back door Little Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin', ""Domino""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A
Today was a good day (Shit)

Left my nigga's house paid (Word)
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep, put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, ""Ice Cube's a Pimp"" (Yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day (Shit)
Hey, wait, wait a minute
Pooh, stop this shit
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?213Embed 92 ContributorsGangsta Rap Made Me Do It Lyrics
- Prior to gangsta rap music, the world was a peaceful place. And then all of that changed: violence, rape, murder, arson, theft, war. These are all things that came about as a result of gangsta rap music- But wasn't Compton dangerous before gangsta rap ?
- Wrong! Compton was a nature preserve for bunny rabbits. When gangsta rap came along, they tore down the country clubs and put up housing projects!
(Maestro!!!) Blame me!
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow flow
You niggas know my pyroclastic flow
It's R-A-W, R-A-W

You lookin' at the grand wizard
Warlord, vocal chord so vicious
And I don't have to show riches
To pull up, pull off with some bad bitches
And it ain't about chivalry
It's about dope lyrics and delivery
It's about my persona
Ain't nothin' like a man that can do what he wanna
Ain't nothin' like a man that you knew on the corner
See 'em come up and fuck up the owner
See 'em throw up Westside California
Nigga, I'm hot as Phoenix, Arizona
I'm Utah: I got multiple bitches
It's a new law, keep a hold of your riches
Dumb nigga, don't spend it as soon as you get it
And recognize I'm a captain and you a lieutenant

If I eat you like a cannibal
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

I'm raw as a dirty needle
Choke an eagle, just to feed all my people
Lyrically I'm so lethal
Plant thoughts in they mind just to defeat you
Ice Cube is a saga
Y'all spit saliva, and I spit lava
I got the fearless flow
Don't get near this, ho, if you scared to go
I keep it gangsta, and why should I change that?
Fuck you old mothafuckas tryin' to change rap
But ain't you the same cat
That sat back when they brought cocaine back?
I'm tryin' to get me a Maybach
How you mothafuckas gonna tell me ""don't say that""?
You the ones that we learned it from
I heard nigga back in 1971
So if I act like a pimp
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I call you a nappy-headed ho
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I shoot up your college
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I rob you of knowledge
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

Thank God when I bless the mic
You finally get to hear the shit that you like
A nigga talkin' about real life
So you can try to get this shit right
Use your brain, not your back
Use your brain, not a gat; it's a party, not a jack
Don't be scared of them people
Walk up in there and show them that you equal
And don't be material
A nigga grew up on milk and cereal
I never forgot Van Ness and imperial
Look at my life, Ice Cube is a miracle
It could be you if you was this lyrical
It could be her if she was this spiritual
‘Cause me and Allah go back like cronies
I ain't gotta be fake, ‘cause he is my homie
If I sell a little crack
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I die in Iraq
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I take you for granted
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it
If I fuck up the planet
Ain't nothin' to it, gangsta rap made me do it

Hello

I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?

The motherfuckin' world is a ghetto
Full of magazines, full clips, and heavy metal
When the smoke settle
I'm just lookin' for a big yellow
In six inch stilettos
Dr. Dre, Hello, perculatin', keep 'em waitin'
While you sittin' here hatin', yo' bitch is hyperventilatin'
Hopin' that we penetratin', you gets naythin'
'Cause I never been to Satan for hardcore administratin'
Gangbang affiliatin', MC Ren'll have you
Wildin' off a zone and a whole half a gallon
(Get to dialing) 9-1-1 emergency
(And you can tell 'em) It's my son, he's hurtin' me
(And he's a felon) On parole for robbery
Ain't no coppin' a plea, ain't no stoppin' a G
I'm in the 6, you got to hop in the 3, company monopoly
You handle shit sloppily, I drop a ki properly
They call me the Don Dada
Pop a collar, drop a dollar, if you hear me you can holla
Even rottweilers follow the Impala
Wanna talk about this concrete? Nigga, I'm a scholar
The incredible, heterosexual, credible
Beg a ho, let it go, dick ain't edible
Nigga ain't federal, I plan shit
While you, hand picked motherfuckers, givin' up transcripts

Villain blows up yo' spot
Take yo' notebook, yo' bitch and yo' Glock
This motherfucker thought the coochie had a padlock
You slapped her ass, that's alarmin'
'Cause she want my Worm like Carmen
We chin check niggas, them thin check niggas
Run trains on gold diggers, beware these fo' niggas
Scarin' motherfuckers like Stephen King flicks
Makin' niggas clear the room like a dyke fleein' dick
Makin 2nd II None shit, nigga like Quik
So when I bomb first, nigga, who you rollin' with?
Fuck that ice on your wrist, fuck yo' fine ass bitch
'Cause you could lose it in a tussle, nigga, watch me hustle
Watch niggas kiss my ass without flexin' a muscle
Bitches, all in the back, they knees waitin' to buckle
Same time, same channel, don't change the dial
Niggas 4 Life, fuckin' your wife, these niggas wild (Hello)
I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
I started this gangsta shit
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?
Did I fall off? Got you in your room
Rippin' every ""Chronic"" poster on your wall off
Just 'cause I put away the sawed off
Now I got you sittin' back with a smirk
Listening with your arms crossed
Questioning Dre's credibility (What?)
Wondering if it's still in me to produce hits
Y'all be killin' me
As if I need to make mo', I got a mansion
And six cars that are paid fo', suck my dick! (Hello)
We came a long way from not givin' a fuck
Sellin' tapes out of a trunk to movin' this far up
Now we got the whole world starstruck
Made a million-plus and still don't give a motherfuck
Motherfucker, I'm Dre! I don't need your respect
I don't need to make another album, bitch, I don't gotta do shit
I do it because I want to, not to stay in the game
Fuck the fame, I'm still stayin' the same, lil' bitch! (Hello)

I heard payback's a motherfucking nigga
That's why I'm sick of getting treated like a goddamn stepchild
Fuck a punk, 'cause I ain't him
You gotta deal with the nine-double-M
The day is coming that you'll all hate
Just think if niggas decide to retaliate
They try to keep me from running up
I never tell you to get down, it's all about coming up
So what they do, go and ban the AK?
My shit wasn't registered any fucking way
So you better duck away, run and hide out
When I'm rolling real slow and the lights out
'Cause I'm about to fuck up the program
Shooting out the window of a drop-top Brougham
When I'm shooting, let's see who drop
The police, the media, and suckers that went pop?
And motherfuckers that say they too black
Put 'em overseas, they be begging to come back
And say we promote gangs and drugs
You wanna sweep a nigga like me up under the rug
Kicking shit called street knowledge
Why more niggas in the pen' than in college?
Because of that line, I might be your cellmate
That's from the nigga ya love to hate
You might also like
(Fuck you Ice Cube!)
Yeah, haha! It’s the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you Ice Cube!)
(Ay yo baby, your mother warned you about me)
It's the nigga you love to hate
(Yo, you ain’t doin' nothin' positive!
Yo, you ain’t doin' nothin 'positive for the brothers, what you gotta say for yourself?)
(You don't like how I'm living? Well, fuck you)

Once again it's on, the motherfucking psycho
Ice Cube the bitch-killer, cap-peeler
Yo, running through the line like Bo, there's no pot to piss in
I put my fist in
Now, who do ya love to hate?
Cause I talk shit and down the eight-ball 'cause I don't fake
You're begging I fall off
The crossover, might as well cut them balls off
And get your ass ready for the Lenching
The Mob is dropping common sense and
We'll gank in the pen', we'll shank
Any Tom, Dick and Hank, and get the ass spanked
It ain't about how right or wrong you live, but how long you live
I ain't with the bullshit
I meet mo' bitches, mo' hoes
Don't wanna sleep, so I keep popping No-Doz
And tell the young people what they gotta know
'Cause I hate when niggas gotta live low
And if you're locked up I dedicate my stylin'
From San Quentin to Rikers Island
We got 'em afraid of the funky shit
I like to clown so pump up the sound
In your Jeep, make the old ladies say
""Oh my god — brake, it's the nigga ya love to hate""
(Fuck you Ice Cube)
Yeah come on fool, it’s the nigga you love to hate
(Fuck you Ice Cube)
Yeah, what up, punk? It’s the nigga you love to hate
A bitch is a...ohhhh

Soul Train done lost they soul
Just call it train cause the bitches look like hoes
I see a lotta others damn
It almost look like the Bandstand
You ask me: ""did I like Arsenio?""
About as much as the Bicentennial
I don't give a fuck about dissing these fools
'Cause they all scared of the Ice Cube
And what I say, what I portray and all that
And ain't even seen the gat
I don't wanna see no dancing
I'm sick of that shit -- listen to the hit
'Cause yo if I look and see another brother
On the video trying to out-dance each other
I'ma tell T-Bone to pass the bottle
And don't give me that shit about role model
It ain't wise to chastise and preach
Just open the eyes of each
'Cause laws are made to be broken up
What niggas need to do is start loc-ing up
And build mold and fold theyself into shape
Of the nigga you love to hate15Embed 49 ContributorsYou Can Do It Lyrics

Fuck the cemetery that a nigga get buried on

Nigga, ask the bartender if you think we lie
But if you think we high, nigga, think again
'Cause when it's sink or swim, you got to think to win (Uh-huh)
And if I drink this Hen', everybody'll know it
'Cause I ain't going for it, so pray to the Lord
That I don't pull out, cuss out and bust out
Go the nigga route (Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click), make the trigger shout, uh

When they buzzin', quick to say fuck your husband
This is for my niggas locked away
Extra love for the ones who ain't got no date
But when we hit checkmate with Ice Cube the great (The great)
Soon as I get a word, we can rush the safe
Fuck them license plates because life is great

Gorilla pimp hoes while other niggas wine and dine 'em
Gotta love this thug shit, S-Class in the mud shit
Pockets on flood shit, OG, lyrical Blood shit
I don't rent, I buy shit, niggas jealous of my shit
Unaware of this young nigga getting all this fly shit
While you're rootin' and recruitin', nigga, 6-8 hoopin'
I was in the hood shootin', plus I had the wife whoopin'
I come from Pyrex bowls and oversized jars
I'm past up stripes, I got stars and bars
No time for playa hatin', Mack paper chasin'
Kicked out the substation to the hip-hop nation
The mo' hits the mo' bigga with illegal weight figgas
Done developed the status of a Platinum-plus nigga
Bust the first bad ho, fo' sho, I can I can hit it

Yeah, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, come on

They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

I'm from the land of the gang bang
Since I was little, ain't a goddamn thang changed
It’s the same old same
Bush run shit like Saddam Hussein
I cock and aim, clinically insane
To deal with this bullshit day-to-day
If I sell some yay or smoke some hay
You bitches wanna throw me up in Pelican's Bay
Call me an animal up in the system
But who's the animal that built this prison?
Who's the animal that invented lower-livin'?
The projects, thank God for Russell Simmons
Thank God for Sugarhill
I'm putting a different kind of steel up to my grill
Y'all know what it is, scared for your own kids
How these ghetto niggas taken over showbiz

Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs

It's boys in the hood, it's toys in the hood
Y'all wanna know why there's noise in the hood
‘Cause there's drugs in the hood, thugs in the hood
Nigga killed a Crip and a Blood in the hood
‘Cause when niggas get tribal
It's all about survival, nobody liable
I got caught by Five-O
Grandmama came to court with her Bible
But when the judge hit the gavel
Now I'm too far from my family to travel
I just came unraveled
Socked the D.A. before I got gaffled
Owned by C.A, State Property
Just like the year fifteen fifty three
Looking for me, a one-way ticket out
Don't understand, what's so hard to figure out?
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Damn, I can't take the pressure
Pulled the 4-4 up out the dresser
Grabbed the weight up out the closet
Po-po coming, but I'm scared to toss it
Y'all know what happened last time I lost it
Can't tell you niggas what the fuckin' boss did
D game got a nigga exhausted
Gotta go for the plea bargain they offered
Twenty years for what?
Breaking these laws that's so corrupt
Taking these halls and fillin' them up
Some powder keg shit that's about to erupt
Aye, y'all, I'm about to be stuck
Until the year two thousand, what the fuck?
In the hood, don't press your luck
‘Cause these motherfuckers will set you up, word up
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us
They give us guns and drugs
Then wonder why in the fuck we thugs
They wanna count the slugs
Then come around here and fuck with us

Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, every hood's the same
Every hood's the same, stop trippin on it

Turn me loose
Break 'em off some
Yeah

Good cop, good cop rollin' with that bad cop
Whatcha doin', boy? Turn in that blood clot
Buck shots, they fly through that drug spot
Robots can give a damn who the fuck shot
Clean cop, clean cop, fuckin' with that dirty cop
Don't act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop, clean cop rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna act proud as a peacock
You know that mean cop might need a detox
Mothafucka tried to blow me out my Reeboks
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop 'em down when these bitches try to lock me down
Hit the ground, hit the turf
Warp the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse that'll make yo ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe
West Coast warlord blacker than the Black Knight
Fuck a black and white when they ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop fillin' out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort
Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sista off course
While these mothafuckas chill on the golf course

Are you fuckin' high, cop? Don't even try cop
Ain't no mothafuckin' drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high tops
And my mothafuckin' tickets to the skybox
Hold up, nigga, I'm a rider
You's a roll-up, yep the controller
Make me mad that's when I get swole up (Don't touch me)
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar
Come out the cuffs, knock off the rust
Throw my hands (What's up?) up you still wanna bust

When they try to get aggressive niggas off the porch (C'mon)

Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?
Tell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, mothafuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig'll let the brick go
Black Lives Matter is not chit chatter
'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place (Let me out)
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker

Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Y'all thought I was soft as cotton
Everybody wants to go to Heaven
Messed around and forgot I was rotten
Everybody wants to go to Heaven

You tell 'em I'm on my way
But nobody (You tell 'em, I'm on my way)
Ah nobody wants to die

I keep my mind on my money, I keep my hand on my gunny
Don't get to playin' with sonny, unless you Playboy Bunny
I'll put four in your tummy, tap two in your brain
See the man ain't playing, if you think it's a game
Haters whisper my name, suckers want what I slang
Arrogant and I'm vain, DA want me to hang
But let me explain, like Abel and Cain
That the black Grim Reaper is not my brother's keeper
Revenge, revenge a killer's on a binge of revenge
It depends if I can live with my sins
Lose family and friends (lost em all)
Now you got to lose life and limb, spit phlegm on them
Got the code of Rakim, homey, jokes ain't allowed
And you boy ain't scared to move the crowd with something loud
If you doubt what I'm about, go ahead an run your mouth
I'm the last thing you see when your time is running out, trick

The hood mentality is a crippling disease that attacks your nervous system
It makes you nervous of the system
Gangsters and hood rats are especially susceptible to this grown-stunting mentality
The hood is where I'm from, but it's not what I am
The hood is where I'm from, but it's not what I am

Fuck school nigga, I'mma be a dope dealer
I'mma be a killer, yep a urban guerrilla
I'mma stack scrilla, yeah buy me a villa
Sell a 5-0 to my auntie Priscilla
I don't give a fuck that she look like ""Thriller""
Hit that shit one more time and fuck around and kill her
Cause I got the heart of a Pittsburgh Steeler
Black nigga draped in gold, with a nine milla
Love money, love jail, love that penitentiary mail
Love the way these niggas smell, keep coming back, can't you tell?
Love to see my mama cry, love to see my babies struggle
Love to see my woman juggle nuts cause she got to hustle
I don't give a fuck how my life go
Now I'm a slave man to this caveman without Geico
Everybody wanna call Michael a psycho
But he ain't never came through the hood with a rifle
Gunning niggas down cause they don't got the right clothes
Hit the wrong person cause we shoot just like hoes
First I was blood thirsty, Mister Mister Controversy
Now I wanna beg for mercy, should have took my ass to Berkeley

So fuck that thinking, fuck that thinking
Fuck them Lincolns, I want Franklins
Come back through here with my crew, I'm gon' have my own shoe
I'm gon' be that little fool coming in your living room
Starting point guard nigga, fresh out of middle school
Either it's the NBA or it's the NFL
I don't know what else I can do to keep my ass up out of jail
I wanna be like Tiger Woods, swing that club, make you sick
(I wanna be like Pacman Jones), (I wanna be like Michael Vick)
I wanna be like Barry Bonds, (I wanna be like O.J. Simpson)
Leave this field, leave this prison

All they give a fuck is what I memorized lately

I wanna be like Santa Claus, I don't wanna be no fucking elf
No kid left behind but he get the runaround
Can't you motherfuckers see that they trying to dumb us down?
Don't trust the government, President is for sale
He don't give a fuck about a nigga, just a oil well
Sell crack, go to jail, bust a rap, go to hell
Do I got to sell my soul if I wanna go to Yale?
Go kiss Oprah's ass if you wanna be Gail
I'd rather have my ass kissed up in Bloomingdale
You can go be a pimp, you can go be a ho
But you only gon' get paid off what you know
If you don't know shit, then you can't work for me
Cause you read your first book in the penitentiary
If you don't wanna shake that hood mentality

Every time I wanna go get a fuckin' brew
I gotta go down to the store with the two
Oriental one penny countin' motherfuckers
That make a nigga mad enough to cause a little ruckus
Thinkin' every brother in the world's out to take
So they watch every damn move that I make
They hope I don't pull out a gat and try to rob
They funky little store, but, bitch, I got a job
Look, you little Chinese motherfucker
I ain't tryin' to steal none of this shit
Leave me alone! (Mother fuck you, yo, yo, check it out)
So don't follow me up and down your market
Or your little chop suey ass'll be a target
Of a nationwide boycott
Juice with the people, that's what the boy got
So pay respect to the Black fist
Or we'll burn your store right down to a crisp
And then we'll see ya
'Cause you can't turn the ghetto into Black Korea

God damn
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
And when dealin' with Da Lench Mob you gots to know steady mobbin' is not just the name of this jam
But a way of life
Bound together by motherfuckers that's known to break em' off something
Give it to me
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood
There goes the neighborhood

Four or five niggas in a mothership
Better known as a deuce and we all wanna smother shit
Bent, front and back glass got tint
Tryin' to get our hands on some dollars and cents
And fools can't hold us
Every chance we get, we hittin' up the rollers
Comin' up short of the green guys
And I might start slangin' bean pies
Or the bootleg t-shirt of the month
With ""U Can't Touch This"" on the front
I'm out to get rich
'Cause life ain't nothin' but money and fuck a bitch
They drop like dominoes
And if you didn't know, Ice Cube got drama, hoes
So after the screwin'
I bust a nut and get up and put on my white Ewings
I'm out the door
All you might get is a rubber on the floor
'Cause I'm ready to hit the road like Mario Andretti
Bitch, cause I'm steady mobbin'

Fuck PacTel, move to Sky Pager
Told all my friends
Don't drink 8-Ball 'cause St. Ides is givin ends
Fools get drunk and wanna compete
Slapboxin' in the street
Niggas get mad, tempers are flarin'
'Cause they got a few bitches starin'
Just for the nappy heads
But scandalous bitches make for happy feds
I make it my duty to cuss 'em
Out 'cause I just don't trust 'em
And if you tell on me I'm bombin' on Betty
Bitch shoulda known I was steady mobbin'

Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
There goes the neighborhood
Since one-time so hot
Got me a stash spot in my hooptie for the Glock
'Cause I'm rollin' on rims
Eating soul food, neckbones from M&M's
Grubbin' like a motherfucker
Greasy-ass lips, now I gots to take a shit
Saw Sir Jinx bellin'
When I hit a left on Ruthelen, ""What up, loc?""
Don't you know that niggas get smoked
That take they life for a joke? Get in, nigga
I'll take you to the pad soon
Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom
Jumped back in my lowrider
Comin' out feelin' about ten pounds lighter
Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat
Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at
Lench Mob ain't nothin' but tramps
For hoes lickin' nuts like stamps
One fool bumpin' music for the yamps
But Ice Cube had more amps, get in, bitch
'Cause I had the jam on
And I don't want to hear shit about a tampon
Gimme the nappy and make me happy
The ho said, ""Pappy, could you slap me
On the ass hard and fast
And could please try not to leave a gash?""
I said, ""Yeah, but I don't play sex
Without puttin' on the latex""
Slipped on the condom
Fucked around and dropped the bomb, son
And it came out sort of like confetti
In for the night, no longer steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?
Steady mobbin'
Have you ever seen such a sight in your life?

(Hey)
Hey Chop
(Hey)
These haters tried to blow me up, man
(Who is this)
The Don Mega, nigga, who you think
(Ey, homie, what happened)
My whole life flashed before my eyes, man

Life...
Niggas used to come and get me
When it was time to disagree with an enemy
Pass the Hennessy it gives me energy
Packed the gat in the small of my back
Where these niggas at, I'll clear the whole pack
Talking shit cause I'm down for my set
I'm a vet, smoking on a wet cigarette
Who these niggas think they are
Wishing on a ghetto star, I represent my tar
I start busting and they scatter like water bugs
Cause these Westside niggas is harder thugs
Enslave us but nothing can save us from sporting Ben Davis
Shootin' at your neighbors
Cause sometimes I feel like a nut
Don’t give a fuck when I open you up
Hot rocks
Fly from the back seat
And busta-ass niggas run like a track meet
And if you caught in the middle
Bleed more than a little (what)
Killer King is the hospital
Feeling numb from the bullets I hum
And when they hit
Black mothers have fits
I don’t give a shit

Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet
Check it
It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there

My house shoes get wet from the dew on the grass
Up early in the morning taking out the trash
Feeling like a loser, alcohol abuser
Two youngsters roll up on a beach cruiser
One on the pedals, the other on the handle bars
Tryna be ghetto stars
They said, ""are you from the Westside is it so?""
I said, ""hell yeah and who want to know?""
Me
In slow mo’, .44 slugs, face down in the mud
Puddle full of blood
Left for dead, the pain starts to spread
Now I can’t feel my legs
I meet Doctor Who at King Drew medical center
As I enter I.C.U
He said the bullet hit a nerve that was vital
I said I can’t move my legs, he said don’t try to
Now this ain’t the end my friend but you'll probably never walk again
I sit there motionless holding this pain inside contemplating suicide
At night I jerk and jerk
But my dick don’t work it don’t even hurt
Now who'd ever thought a nigga rude as Ice Cube
A'be pissing through a tube
Fool I'm a vet
Fool, I'm a vet you can bet
I can dance underwater and not get wet (check it)
It’s raining bullets and I'm still there
Young ghetto nigga in a wheelchair

Fuck a V-A they need G-A
Gang Hospital for a cripple
Now I'm drinking Ripple
Same corner, same hood I'm still there
With bandanas tied to my wheel chair
To all the hood rat hoes I'm fired
They mad cause my tongue get tired
Now everybody want to put they dope on me
Sayin I won't get searched by the LAPD
I'm sittin' in a doorway deuce-five
Depending on that to keep my ass alive
I don’t got bows but my arm's about a one-six
With fucking legs looking like tooth picks
Some times I can’t deal
Got to beg the BG's to roll me up the hill
Put me on the porch
Now I'm on the torch
Smoking cocaine
Just to maintain
Nothing to gain nothing to lose
And last night I couldn’t make it to the bathroom
Feeling like a 2-year-old
You can’t get a sip from the brew I hold
It’s the only friend to a stranger
AKA: handicapped gangbanger
There's a lot in my life I regret becoming a ghetto vet
Fool I'm a Vet
Fool I'm a vet you can bet
That I could dance underwater and not get wet

It's raining bullets and I'm still there
I'm still there

Yeah

Yeah, I'm out that Brooklyn, now I'm down in Tribeca
Right next to De Niro, but I'll be hood forever
I'm the new Sinatra, and since I made it here
I can make it anywhere, yeah, they love me everywhere
I used to cop in Harlem, hola, my Dominicanos (Dímelo!)
Right there up on Broadway, brought me back to that McDonald's
Took it to my stash spot, 560 State Street
Catch me in the kitchen, like a Simmons whippin' pastry
Cruisin' down 8th Street, off-white Lexus
Drivin' so slow, but BK is from Texas
Me? I'm out that Bed-Stuy, home of that boy Biggie
Now I live on Billboard and I brought my boys with me
Say ""What up?"" to Ty Ty, still sippin' Mai Tais
Sittin' courtside, Knicks and Nets give me high fives
Nigga, I be spiked out (Come on), I could trip a referee (Come on)
Tell by my attitude (Come on) that I'm most definitely from

In New York (Ayy, uh, yeah; aha)
Concrete jungle (Yeah) where dreams are made of

Catch me at the X with OG at a Yankee game
Shit, I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can
You should know I bleed blue, but I ain't a Crip though
But I got a gang of niggas walkin' with my clique though
Welcome to the meltin' pot, corners where we sellin' rock
Afrika Bambaataa shit, home of the hip-hop
Yellow cab, gypsy cab, dollar cab, holla back
For foreigners, it ain't fair, they act like they forgot how to add
Eight million stories out there in the naked
City, it's a pity half of y'all won't make it
Me? I gotta plug Special Ed, ""I Got It Made""
If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade
Three dice cee-lo, three-card Marley
Labor Day Parade—rest in peace, Bob Marley
Statue of Liberty, long live the World Trade (Come on, come on)
Long live the king, yo (Come on)—I'm from the Empire State, that's

Or they could step out of bounds quick, the side lines is
Lined with casualties who sip the life casually
Then gradually become worse—don't bite the apple, Eve!
Caught up in the in-crowd, now you're in-style
Into the winter gets cold, en vogue with your skin out
City of sin is a pity on a whim
Good girls gone bad, the city's filled with them
Mami took a bus trip, now she got her bust out
Everybody ride her, just like a bus route
""Hail Mary"" to the city, you're a virgin
And Jesus can't save you, life starts when the church end
Came here for school, graduated to the high life
Ball players, rap stars, addicted to the limelight
MDMA (Come on) got you feelin' like a champion (Come on)
The city never sleeps (Come on), better slip you a Ambien

Who wants that perfect love story anyway, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
Who wants that hero love that saves the day, anyway?
Cliché, cliché, cliché, cliché
What about the bad guy goes good, yeah?
An innocent love I'm misunderstood, yeah?
Black hour glass, our glass
Toast to clichés in a dark past
Toast to clichés in a dark past

Boy meets girl, girl perfect woman
Girl get to bustin' before the cops come running
Chuck the deuces, chugging D'USSÉ, ugh
Fuck what you say, boys in blue say

I don't care if we on the run
Baby as long I'm next to you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you is a crime
Tell me why do I bring out the best in you
Why

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but
You might also like
They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose

I'm an outlaw, got an outlaw chick
Bumping 2Pac, on my outlaw shit
Matching tats, this Ink don't come off
Even if rings come off, if things ring off
My nails get dirty, my past ain't pretty
My lady is, my Mercedes is
My baby momma harder than a lot of you niggas
Keep it 100, hit the lottery niggas
You ain't about that life ain't gotta lie to me, nigga
You know it's till the death, I hope it's obvi to niggas
Ugh
Cross the line, speak about mine
I'ma wave this TEC, I'm a geek about mine
Touch a nigga where his rib at, I click clack
Push your mothafuckin' wig back, I did that
I been wilding since a juvi, she was a good girl
'til she knew me, now she is in the drop bustin' Uey's, screaming

They can take me
Now that I found the places that you
Take me
Without you I got nothing to lose
Deeper than words, beyond right
Die for your love, beyond life
Sweet as a Jesus piece, beyond ice
Blind me baby with your neon lights
Ray Bans on, police in sight
Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome, you make it home""
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said: ""Don't embarrass me"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

Oh

I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; ""What if—""
""You over my shit?""

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

I'm never gonna treat you like I should76Embed 173 ContributorsTranslationsFrançaisTom Ford Lyrics

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents

Go ahead and watch the sun blaze on the waves of the ocean

Boat docked in front of Hermès picking cotton
Silk and fleeces, lay on my Jesus
Oh my God, I hope y'all don't get seasick

Muhammad Hovi my back against the rope
The black Maybach, I'm back inside the boat
Shepard Fairey they finally gave me some hope
Can't believe they got a nigga to vote
Democrat? Nope, I sold dope
In trouble waters I had to learn how to float
On the ocean, I'm in heaven

We gon' run this town

We are, yeah, I said it, we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is La Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug

But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life Good Will Hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring

Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?

Kill JAY-Z, they'll never love you
You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, JAY-Z
Fuck JAY-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z?
And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die JAY-Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, JAY-Z
Cry JAY-Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him twenty million without blinkin'
He gave you twenty minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it

Now my hand on the Bible on the stand

Cracks ribs, go through cribs, and other things

This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, oh, H to the O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, oh, not D.O.C.
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do It Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude, finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude with the Lexus
Fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors
This ain't a movie, dog (Oh, shit)

Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm gone
And I don't care what you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you jack

Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""By any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

I loved your point of view 'cause you held no punches
Still I left you for months on end
It's been months since I checked back in
We're somewhere in a small town
Somewhere lockin' a mall down
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside, a nigga so sick

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry, uh
Can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch""
Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
And then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?

Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile

Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America like me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

I done turned Havana to Atlanta
Guayabera shirts and bandanas
Every time you think they got me I switch the planner
Bulletproof this, radio scanners

Balling 'til they ban us
You getting too much bread, they try to jam you
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents
Politicians never did shit for me
Except lie to me, distort history
Wanna give me jail time and a fine
Fine, let me commit a real crime
I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets
Hear the freedom in my speech
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free
Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb
I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt

Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster

I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it

I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

Head of the class and she just won a swallowship

Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs

Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster

Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said ""I'm sorry"" too many times

She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21, but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit

And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept

My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin

And it's rich nigga racism
That's that, ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Um—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?

I said, ""Baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity

Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir

The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'

Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405

But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house

Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
(21st-century schizoid man)
Colin Powells, Austin Powers
Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
Where the bad bitches, huh? Where you hidin'?
I got the power make your life so excitin'

Now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Mmm, now this will be a beautiful death
I'm jumping out the window, I'm letting everything go
I'm letting everything go
Now this will be a beautiful death
Jumping out the window, letting everything go
Letting everything go
You got the power to let power go?

Baby, don't you bet it all
On a pack of Fentanyl
You might think they wrote you off
They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine

No half-truths, just naked minds
Caught between space and time
This not what they had in mind

Man, it's so hard not to act reckless

And what I do? Act more stupidly

Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced

If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief

As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard

See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say

Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap

Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock

I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast
Like this in a long time, don't you see that long line?
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream, ""It's alive!""
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
""K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!

I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers

Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, I'm talkin'

If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS

To settle down, my main concern

In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever

You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

""Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?""
""Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!""
""Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.""
""We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.""
""Bring a nigga back a black!""
""Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga... Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back.""
""Bring a nigga back a black!""
(*Hangs up*)
""Ahh, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?""
""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now.""
""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus' name, amen""
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day

Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some Black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song

Uh-uh, fuck that

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is Black, she Black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me

""Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?""
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ""Okay, then we are crack babies,"" damn
""Why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax""
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, ""Read between the lines,"" yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood""

Poverty's paradise
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(I've been hungry all my life)

What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart""
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To Pimp a Butterfly

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (We’re on top together)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

Mic Check
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
Come through, dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC
Crowd around
I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac

Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch

Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!

Operation Doomsday complete
All your intercoms casualty and damage testing

Enough! You talk of the people's rights
The people have only those rights which I choose to give them
And that's for their own good, believe me
I do, DOOM
They disappoint me, they must work faster
But the prisoner-
Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me
Watch him, I have special plans for that one

Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries, some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed
(Food, we need food!)
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say, ""Aw Hell!""
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual
For a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell them devils, ""Hell no, sell y'all own Jello""
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (""Food!"")
What up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep a shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which, they couldn't find the Villain, like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?
Punk, try and ask why ours be better
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table
Like, ""It's on me, put it on my tab, kid""
However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron-horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him, ""Get off it,"" and a bunch of other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon: stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him autograph her derriere, it read:
""To Wide Load, this yardbird taste like fried toad turd
Love, Villain""—take pride in code words
Crooked eye, mold, nerd, geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back—uh, plumbing fixed
""How is only one left? The pack comes in six!
Whatever happened to two and three?""
A herb tried to slide with four and five
And got caught like, ""What you doing, G?
Don't make him have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!""
Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MCs sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for ""Teletubbies""
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies:
""In and out, one, two, three—no bodies, please!
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy done gone to war

See, most cats treat her like Foofur
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the ""Super!""
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be ""Super!""

So she look sweet when she go to meet the ""Super!""
Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it
Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag, never let her fry the ragù
Which'll have you under some type of spell crying, ""Dag, boo""
Her name on your back in a tattoo
Whether a bougie broad, nerd ho, street chick
Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknik
You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll duke her
And be a father to your child like the ""Super!""
He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em, ""Take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real
Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal
Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck, let him know how you feel
And while he's running down to All-Star Weekend to ball
I'm coming with the U-Haul"" ""Super!""

Already woke, spared a joke, barely spoke, rarely smoke
Stared at folks when properly provoked, mirror broke
Here, share a strawberry morning
Gone, an' more important spawning, torn in, poor men sworn in
Cornish hens switching positions
Auditioning morticians, saw it in a vision, ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers
Seven figures invigor
Nigga, fresh from out the jail, alpha male
Sickest ninja injury this century, enter plea
Lend sympathy to limper Simple Simon rhymin' emcees
Trees is free, please leave a key
These meager fleas, he's the breeze
And she's the bee's knees for sheez, G's of G's
Seize property, shopper sprees, chop the cheese
Drop degrees to stop diseases, gee-whiz, pa
DOOM rock grandma like the kumbaya
Mama was a ho hopper, papa was a rolling stone star like Obama
Pull a card like oh, drama
Civil liberties
These little titties' abilities riddle me, middle C (Ah)
Mm, give a MC a rectal hysterectomy
Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z, what you expect to get for free?
Shit from me, history
The key, plucked it off the mayor
Chucked it in the ol' tar pit off La Brea, player
They say he's gone too far
DOOM'll catch 'em after Jumah on cue lacka
Do what ya gotta do, grrah
The rumors are not true, got to ma
No prob, got the job, hot bod, heartthrob
Scotchguard the bar with cotton swabs, dart lob
Bake a cake, sweet, Jamaica trade in treats on the beach

Ayo, yo, y'all can't stand right here
In his right hand was your man's worst nightmare
Loud enough to burst his right eardrum, close-range
The game is not only dangerous, but it's most strange

I sell rhymes like dimes
The one who mostly keep cash but brag about the broker times
Joking rhymes, like the ""Is you just happy to see me?"" trick
Classical slapstick rappers need Chapstick
A lot of 'em sound like they in a talent show
So I give 'em something to remember like the Alamo
Tally-ho! A high Joker like a Spades game
Came back from five years laying and stayed the same
Saying, electromagnetic field, it blocks all logic, Spock
And G-Shocks her biological clock
When I hit it, slid into the shitter, thought I killed her goose
Her Power U's was pure Brita water filter juice

Friends

As you call 'em, they call you when they need something
Trees for the bluntin', to G's for the frontin'
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of they eyes
Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies
Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies
Close, or really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me:
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays, he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn’t even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs: ""No feeding the baboons""
Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance
Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know your plans
(How many of us have them?) A show of hands
(Friends) is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crew see
You telling me I try to act broke
Jealousy the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
Ghetto Cinderellas lead 'em right to your stack, loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I checked the dictionary for the meaning of friend
It said: ""person one likes to socialize with
Sympathizer, helper"", and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch
Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
(Flick!) And when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot
I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel
When it get for real, steel get to sparkin'
Everything darken, it ain't no talkin'
For somethin' so cheap, it sure buys a lot of trouble
Ya better off focusing than tryin' to plot to bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is
(One's we can depend on, friends)
Some come in the form of co-dependents
A lot of times only end up being co-defendants
Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail, begging for repentance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust among royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze than give 'em the glory
(How many of us have—) a similar story?
(Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing
Just so when I let her get the man thing
She know it's no strings, we could do the damn thing
But ho, it's no rings, just how the tramp swings
Will she see him again? That depends on
""How good was the skins?"" and ""Could she memorize the lessons?""
It ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let him stab it, she know they're just friends

[Outro Skit: Character 1; Mr. Fantastic; (Invisible Woman);

The most powerful, the most mysterious monarch in all the world
Guided by a fighting force that never sleeps
That never relaxes its vigilance
For none is as feared, none has as many foes
As DOOM, the awesome armorclad lord of
I know who Doom is (Then tell us)
He happens to be the most dangerous man in the world
I’d hope we’d never hear from him
I’d hope we’d never have to battle him
But now the worst has happened and I must tell you what we’re up against
I first met DOOM years ago
When he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments
One day while conducting a secret experiment
 Later, when he recovered from his injuries
Instead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful
 What have I done to myself?
My face, it is hideous
He traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face
(I’m sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you)
He traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen
He continued his search, never showing his face
Unless threatened by bandits who prey on travelers
Who foolishly wander alone through their domain32Embed 145 ContributorsPotholderz Lyrics

I strive to be humble, lest I stumble
Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo
Sauce, Tyson is a fowl holocaust
Hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry, I'm fed up
Ignore cordon bleu, stand up, get up
Lunge for your knife, don't forget your potholders

What, these old things? About to throw 'em away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ
Usually I take them off with Oil of Olay
MCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay
Hot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?
Working on a way that we can roll away tinted
Some say the price of holding heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoo pie
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
(Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die
They need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry
You're on the list, if not, pick a number spot
Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat
I coulda had a V-8
F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight
Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy
That night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie
So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted
Take it from the fire side, it won't get blistered
Got it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit
These metal fingers be holding (Hot shit)

Born under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it into fine wine
""Barely born a virgin"" is what the stars said
Black not white, red all over, though, like Elmo
Twenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking
I make music every weekend
It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love
I get mad love, but I detest the labor
And its wages—you know, death?
I'm servin' life from this gift of God
Don't forget your potholders, my niggas

Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his galoshes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed to know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough, it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess
For ten K's, he'll cave a chicken chest S
Yes, y'all, the dub will get you trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub together nickels
But, tut-tut, he 'bout to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have 'em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' 'til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah, your boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand-new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told 'em, ""Firing pins was separate""
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged in advance to translate it and ignored her, sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie wanna cop a quarter-ton, run for the border

With a dot on the guard as he squat on a log

Used to keep a full stock of work, half rocked and half shake

We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn

He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off sickly lyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Son's fanbase know the brother-man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged, rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile (ding!) Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head

He could be some kind of wacko
Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess they read up on a message board
If so, I got bridges for the low low

Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy

Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang

Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass

Wilder than the Nile, hold power like the great pyramids
Of Giza, and stay leanin' like the tower of Pisa
Give him something he can feel that's soft to squeeza
Raw with the pen, and on the mic—off the hezza
Get shot off that wide-eyed talk
And if he had a pot, he'd still piss on the sidewalk
Can't take the street out the street-person
Lookin' for the perfect beat, coercion into heat-burstin'
They couldn't spot him on the spot date
Got the only tape that come with a free hot-plate
Whoever do get to see me sing
With the 3 D-ring sittin' stationary like B.B. King
Can see how it really sting, it ain't no front row
Standing room only at the motocross stunt show
The ruckus ain't up to Snuffleupagus
Me and Sub' is like the brown Smothers Brothers (""My love is—"")
Vaster than the seven seas, bigger than Mount Kilimanjaro
If they don't know, fill 'em in tomorrow
On the horror show, a mental note: return Bob’s record
Swear to God, before he gets a job, he robs an Eckerd
Blessed with a hot flow, tested it, got dough
Invested in stress, the best to finesse an opto
As I reminisce, never forgot when I was very broke
Shot the Henny straight, couldn't afford to cop the Cherry Coke
Or should I say, broke with wealth?
To know enough to give them just enough rope to yoke they self
Plan B before I take the ring and pawn it
The long arm of the law couldn't even put they fingers on it
Dog-gone it, do the statistics
How he bust lyrics, it's too futuristic for ballistics
And far too eccentric for forensics
I dedicate this mix to Subroc, the hip-hop Hendrix

It's horrible
One little evening alone, home
End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
Supposed to be checking emails
All I got is messages from ass naked females
I don't know a Jenny
She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
And that's the last time I saw her
But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah
And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out
And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
I wonder what I owe her
For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa
(""Nite nite!"") Uh, okay honey, sweet dreams
Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
A metal handful, wipe it on the quilt
Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk
Locked in, looking at your picture
Fully clothed winter and I'm right there with ya
Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
A man could only wish you do the same 'til he get home
Fat chance, at least he get snacks
That'd have to do 'til a brother get back
Until then smack One-Eyed Jack
And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
That's three different flavors
Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry wafers
Acting all hard, 'bout to get beat up
I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
Soon as he fell off the beat down
All I hear is, ""13th cell, put the sheet down""
Damn C.O., what the hell do she know?
Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low
A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again
In the wee hours, he's gotten farther
Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
The wiz with her legs bent, pregnant
God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
I need a L, it's hard to drink without it
And could use some kookies but trying not to think about it
Watching ""BET"" on jazz for knowledge on file
Every other commercial, college hoes gone wild
Soft batch, I prefer the other bunch
Like we got for lunch, chocolate fudge butter crunch

Always kept 'em dipped in milk and stuck together

And good like 25 cent oatmeal raisin

Give it a sec for the pain to start this wreck right here
It ain't for the faint of heart
They thought they saw the worst verse
From the team of G men who seem like nerds at first
Once they get to know us people dig us
Leaders in the fight for equal rights for niggas
Inventor of the more dementeder flow, no bout a-doubt it
This go for if you're bout it, bout it or rowdy, rowdy
Whatever's clever, the master foe
Who every hooker heard of, but now a ho know
If we see tomorrow, the next day classes

Have no fear, the ninja here
Feel 'em like the tinge in your ear from drinkin' ginger beer
When it's on, loco head gon' lay low
And heat it like beef patty, coco bread con queso
If you say so, lace the whole case load
They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show
He told 'em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halos
Say ho if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash in a stash than a peso
Okay, yo, y'all know who to follow
Tie 'em up in the crib and leave they place hollow
Oh, shoot, the goose she's loose
So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste couscous
Stash the deuce deuce, troops askin' ""truce, truce""
Today on intense wreck week
We have the Supervillain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil-neck geeks
Train a sane brain to an insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain your support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make your daughter laugh, then slaughter the ass
See 'em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do somethin' and never be back once he leaves the scene
Keep more medicated pads than Stridex
For his own side wreck with no known side effects
Before you press charges use your noodle
So what when he grab the mic he crush your cute cuticles
Keep your mouth shut, everything will be beautiful
It would be awfully rude to you, now get back to your hooty hoo
Damn it, it ain't worth the drama, can it
From the calm bandit, eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in he lit the room
Boom, reschedule my noon with Brit Hume
(DOOM!) In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain
Maintain and say it, don't spray it
You wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it
If I had a dime for every rhymer's that bust guns
I'd have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog
When it rain, it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One, two, microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker
This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage, it's like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar
And jump off the stage like ""Yee haw!""

Met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills
All thirty three nerves, controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate
More ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin'
Intuition, maybe it was me, I couldn't see
Holding onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt

Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him""

Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath

Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule

Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes

In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath

(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already
I've been fucked over, left for dead, dissed and forgotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called Blueprint (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say
That you better than B.I.G., dick-suckin' lips (Ha)
Why don't you let the late, great veteran live?
I will
Not lose (God's son across the belly, I'll prove you lost already), uh
The king is back
Where my crown at? (Ill Will)
Ill Will, rest in peace, let's do it, niggas

(I) Fuck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you, the king, you know you
(Not) God's Son across the belly
(Lose) I'll prove you lost already
Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow (Burn slow)
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy (Ill)
Rocafella died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all tryna take my spot, fellas?
Feel these hot rocks, fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my Glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin' girls now 'cause of your looks? (Girls, girls, girls, haha)
Negro, please, ha, you no-mustache-havin'
With whiskers like a rat, compared to Beans, you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin' with Kane, to Irv, to B.I.G
And Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin' faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons, ha
R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label, gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn, you on Jaz dick
So little Shawny's gettin' gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips? (Nigga)
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss171Embed 263 ContributorsTranslationsEspañolEnglishLife’s a Bitch Lyrics

Ayo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? Yeah, yeah
Ayo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
'Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
I'm sayin' that's what this is all about, right?
Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high
'Cause life's a bitch and then you die

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high

Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye
I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we get high
'Cause you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bitch and then you die, that's why we puff lye

It's mine, it's mine, it's mine—whose world is this?

I sip the Dom P, watchin' Gandhi 'til I'm charged, then
Writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words past the margin
To hold the mic I’m throbbin', mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)

To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip, we box up crazy bitches, aimin' guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?
You flippin' coke or playin' spit, spades, and strip poker?

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit

I peeped you frontin'
I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw
But, uh—a thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers (Word up)

It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose
Nas will rock well; it ain't hard to tell

I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot
Vocals will squeeze Glocks
MCs eavesdrop, though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell

Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove

Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks

He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Life
I wonder.. will it take me under?
I don't know
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked
Evidently, it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing ya clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be: Paradise life, relaxing
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Opening eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six-digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa!
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land

You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait! I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit!
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)

Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still livin' for today, in these last days and times)

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons

Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Aiyyo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pulling a TEC out the dresser; police got me under pressure

Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moët drinking, marijuana smoking street dweller
Who's always on the corner, rolling up bless
When I dress, it's never nothing less than Guess
Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, buddha-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

Represent, represent
Represent, represent
Represent, represent
No doubt, see my stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Barkim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs

Nas is like; Nas is like; Nas is like)
Umm, Premo, Nas
Yeah, yeah, yo
(Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is; Nas is;

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell... (Nas, Nas, Nas)

Before the Christ, After the Death, the last one left
Let my cash invest in stock
Came a long way from blastin' TEC's on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin' acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes givin' fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise — thug or die
Makin' choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much success to you, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later, we'll all see who the prophet is

I'm like beef, bustin' heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, green leaf breather
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin' somethin' deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your 9, your man you would die for
Always got you, I’m like Pac, dude you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies
I'm like all races combined in one man, like the '99 Summer Jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like bein' locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feelin' of a millionaire spendin' a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down, and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now

(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'mma ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) A-yo, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
You might also like
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out
(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) '92, it's halftime
(Right…) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strapped
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace, God!) Peace, God! Now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis — is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin' — some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""Peace!""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

This is what.. this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about, word
Time to take affirmative action, son
They just don't understand, you know what I mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
You know what I mean?
Niggas don't understand the four devils:
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact, sip your Cognac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler!
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em, tie 'em with tape
No escape, the Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown
Aristocrats politickin' daily wit' diplomats

Yo! The smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your C.R.E.A.M. go between us
Real shit! My Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega — the pretty boy with Mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!

Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that ""Somebody gotta die"" shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so Hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabees be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In a Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E-Moneybags got Moët Chandon, bundle of 62
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a phat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby!
From BK to the 'Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods — they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke, nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We gotta flee to Panama
But wait — it's half-and-half, ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16, double it, times 3
We got 48, which mean a whole lot of C.R.E.A.M
Divide the profit by 4, subtract it by 8, we back to 16
Now add the other 2 that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki, then that's more for me
Mad coke and mad leak
Plus a 500, cut in half is 250
Now triple that — times 3, we got three quarters of another ki
The Firm, baby, Vol. 1, uh!38Embed 144 ContributorsOne Mic Lyrics

One time
Yeah, yeah

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience leavin' victims with doctors

One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now
All I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)
All I need is one mic (This is all I need)

All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now
All I need is one mic (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
All I need is one mic (All I ever needed in this world, fuck cash)

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how

The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""

Check it out
I call it, yeah, yeah

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters

I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You seventeen, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure
But she rockin' with it

For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important

And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off
‘Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters

Where is he, the man who was just like me?
I heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
Where is he, the man who was just like me?
Heard he was hidin' somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

I want someone who like the champagne I like, my a-alike
Someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain’t afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
'Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She loves art, she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herb's natural medicine, she cookin' good
She tell me everything is cool when it ain't lookin' good
For real, the world so ill, yo, I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

Yes, I'm alone, and I realize when I get home

I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'?
I be tryin' to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool to ask?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I'd gallivant around the Equator, if that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo & Stitch
Pour my Pinot Grigio and Cris' with some lime, what is this?
An immaculate version of ""Me & My Bitch"" by Biggie
With all respect, 'cause you the only one that gets me

Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

You can hate me now (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now (Uh)
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down

Do it now
Weak, jealous motherfuckers!
Do it now, do it now

Don't hate me, hate the money I see (Yeah), clothes that I buy (Uh-huh)
Ice that I wear, flows that I try (C'mon)
Close your eyes (That's right), picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater (You the best, that's right)
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters (Haha)
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper (Watch this)
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens (Hah, picture that)
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary
Do it now!
You can hate me now (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Now) (You can hate me)

You can hate me now

Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warned me: ""When you on top there's envy""
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the street, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too! (Do it now!)

You can hate me now (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (Now) (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Do it now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (C'mon) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (Uh) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Uh, uh)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now (Do it now)

I like this, I like the way this feels (Let's go)

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows (Yeah)
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one (Right)
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jammin' up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord (Uh)
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors (That's right)
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks (You tried?)
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' 'em up (That's what you hate)
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just inferior man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

(Yeah) (It won't stop)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (It won't stop) ever in your life (You can hate me) (Never!)
And that's what you can't understand!

You can hate me now (C'mon) (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Do it now, do it now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (Do it now, do it now, niggas) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (C'mon) (You can hate me now)

You can hate me now (You can hate me now) (Hate me now)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now) (C'mon, niggas!)

You can hate me now (C'mon, niggas!) (You can hate me now)

They don't give you one single rose while you can smell it
So I pick from my own garden (Garden)
Wanna go out in my garden like Godfather
Grandkids and a Rottweiler got over the block trauma (Yeah, trauma)
So what you sayin', nigga? You gots to chill (Uh-huh)
Thinkin' you the truth, really you not for real (EPMD!)
Back to back with it, the hardest shit of the year (Nasir Jones, remix)

EPMD, we back in business
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us, come to your senses (Uh)
P is the second comin' of God, somеthin' to witness
Piece of shit, fly on your hеad like Mike Pence's, we in the trenches
I'm mad, better yet, I'm on a rampage
My people can't even get minimum wage
Fuck a stimulus (Uh), give me some interest (Uh)
Give me a loan (Oh), give me a home
Give me that land you owe me so I can roam
So when you trespass, blaow, one in your dome

Sign up for my masterclass, Escobar
Feet up at Mets Stadium at my restaurant
Tied in from AZ to Dave East
You know my thoughts get crazy
My teachers, they couldn't grade me
I know some Haitians in Dade County, got choppers in Haiti
She booked a flight to Colombia, made her body amazin'
Just to post it on Tumblr, this that ""fuck up the summer"" shit
I don't care what you comin' with, me and Hit-Boy runnin' shit (Runnin' shit)
Big gold, rope chains, but they flooded now (Yeah, flooded now)
Pull up with the Ghost like a haunted house (Haunted house)
She gettin' scary, blood on my hands like Carrie
Might walk through a cemetery to see where hip-hop is buried
I said it was dead, but it faked its death like Machiavelli
You see letters in red splatter, look like sauce and spaghetti
(Yeah, ready?)
EPMD, we're back in business (What?)
Livin' in cramped conditions, will give you ammunition
I stock those shelves, I got those shells like Taco Bell and I'm not gon' fail
I got no L's (Noels) like Christmas, you don't wanna make the claws (Claus) come out (Nah)
Y'all should call yourselves Santa (Why?) 'cause none of y'all are real (Nah)
Not a 'single one' (Like what?), like a dollar bill (Yeah)
Just like your bitch in appellate court, she's on a pill (Appeal)
We got her a 'bond' and she'll
Never 'bail' on me (Bail on me), not even outta jail (Haha, jail)

Just a lotta skrill
Lady, my paper's so crazy, I just tossed a mil' out the window of my mobile
On the fuckin' freeway on the way here (Yeah)
Like Rudolph and his homies when they pullin' the sleigh, yeah
That's a lot of bucks flyin' when I'm makin' it rain, dear
Green on me but no weed, shorty, just these, darling
A pocket full of pills, some are Tylenol 3s, prolly two or three Molly
So some are E  (Summary), which reminds me of ""Rap Summary,"" mami
My theme song, me and ""P"" always used to play that shit on repeat all day
So please call me ""Big Daddy"" (Daddy)

Me, I'm free of debt, yeah, green is on Chia Pet (Woo)
This is the effects of my old neighborhood misery index
Poverty at its peak, OCD and PTSD, I guess
R.I.P. out to DMX, Stezo E and Nipsey
Ecstasy and Prince Markie Dee, MF DOOM, I hit 50 via text
Told him that I love him 'cause I don't even know when I'ma see him next (Nah)
Tomorrow could be your death (Bring that beat back)
Yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
'Cause the brain's illa trained killer, danger, deranged
And I drank all the DayQuil (Yeah) I blank on the paper
Then wait 'til the page fill up (What?)
Hate spiller, shameful the strength of a pain pill or tranq'
I just pray for the day when I'm able to say that I'm placed with the greats
And my name's with the Kane's and the Wayne's, and the Jay's and the Dre's
And the Ye's, and the Drake's and the J Dilla's, Jada's, Cool J's
And the Ra's and amazin' as Nas is, and praise to the Gods of this

He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

Hope I don't catch a homo, grossing our net

Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me
Fuck sadness, had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness, at me you wouldn’t look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi

Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body
I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty

You know the deal; it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-comin' live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot, it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway & Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor — better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""Cha-pow!"" — you dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like $69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everythin' that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right — you are not alone
Rock your hardhat, black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facin' life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell, but they could rock you at PlayStation

Budget cutbacks, but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'

I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

Man, duke, I was in love with this girl, duke
I was tore up, dog, I'm tellin' you, man
Shit is wild, man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name, love? Where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up
Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""A-yo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!)
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin'? ""Oh, I'm fine"", my name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""

For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

She blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, word?
I played it low though
I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just..
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me..

""Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby, you know what it's like, some brothers don't be comin' right""
I understand, I'm feelin' you
Besides, ""Can I have a dance?"" ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singin' Gregory Isaacs
Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man, I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., ""Come now"", I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart, I got to have it
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next mornin', she gone like it was magic
Aww, damn it! My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some bangin' ass Asian playin' lay it down and lick me up

Yo!

The way I feel — sometimes, it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face, but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down the focus
The focus get cleared, then the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly, sometimes, y'all don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black
I'm so wide awake that I'm hardly ever 'sleep
My flow forever deep
And it's volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere — penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life — holla, black, you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force; high, low or right across
Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren
I swing 'round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small action knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckers tryin' to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
Then, the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind 'em
It's everywhere! — Penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life — holla, black, you know it well

You say, ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say, ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on! Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, huh!

My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
I write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
Ahaha, from the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)
Full-blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum
Young man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (There it is)
While you still tryin to find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's En-ga-lish
But caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunition
(Chi-chi-pow) Move from the gate, voice cued
On your tape, putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself, akh'
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)

The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock

Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!) Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory, a class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you16Embed 60 ContributorsUMI Says Lyrics

I ain't no perfect man

Yeah
Yo, yo, what time the plane leavin'?
Alright, see you at the airport

I'm leaving, on a jet plane
I don't know if I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me, like you know I'll never go
Even though you know I will
I'm a travellin' man
Movin' through places, space and time
Got a lotta things I got to do
But God willin', I'm comin' back to you, baby-boo

Got a lotta things I got to do
But God willin', I'm comin' back to you, baby-boo

""Well, go 'head and leave""
The call heard around the world from the wives of MC's
These cats is payin' more than half a pound
My garment bag'll snatch it down
Ain't got the skate, but we can probably run it back in town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern MC, i.e. the blue collar worker
'Cause this thing called rhymin' no different from coal minin'
We both on assignments to unearth the diamond
When you start climbin', then them eyes start shinin'
You be strugglin' and strivin', and they think you prime-timin'
Maintain and keep silent, make note and observation
This confrontation, this is the daily operation
My concentration, stay focused on my recitation
'Bout to reach my destination with no pause or hesitation
Baby, make the preparation 'cause this ain't no recreation
This is pro-ball, and we lettin' you know, y'all
At the show, y'all, doin' this for dough, y'all

But God willin', I'll be back home
To drop these heavy-ass bags up off my backbone
Around the world with a catalogue of rap songs
My baby girl is walkin', been away for that long
But no, you haven't
Well, at least that's how it seem to me
My hometown is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leanin' leisurely
The new jacks up in the parks smokin' greenery
Easily taken for granted when you up in it
But it's sweet scented, when you been down for a minute
Move around city limits, break it down with the vintage
The inovinin', classical b-boy image
Collect the winnings, 'cause it the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune, not the fame here
From New York to the Cackalacks
Cali and the Cadillacs
Chicago know we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia state
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate
Let's set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands

Bismillah ir Rahman ir Raheem
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
And I'm very happy that you came here
Ooh-oooh, whee!
That was for Brooklyn
Ha ha, we get it every time
You got me on? Oh
Shout out to all of my crew, East-West, North-South
All the continent, Europe, all abroad international
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
It's a lot of things goin' on y'all
21st century is comin'
20th century almost done
A lot of things have changed
A lot of things have not, mainly us
We gon' get it together right? I believe that
Listen—people be askin' me all the time
""Yo Mos, what's gettin' ready to happen with hip-hop?""
(Where do you think hip-hop is goin'?)
I tell em, ""You know what's gonna happen with hip-hop?
Whatever's happening with us""
If we smoked out, hip-hop is gonna be smoked out
If we doin' alright, hip-hop is gonna be doin' alright
People talk about hip-hop like it's some giant livin' in the hillside
Comin' down to visit the townspeople
We are hip-hop
Me, you, everybody, we are hip-hop
So hip-hop is going where we going
So the next time you ask yourself where hip-hop is going
Ask yourself: where am I going? How am I doing?
Till you get a clear idea
So if hip-hop is about the people
And the hip-hop won't get better until the people get better
Then how do people get better? (Hmm)
Well, from my understanding people get better
When they start to understand that they are valuable
And they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money
Or 'cause somebody, think they sexy
But they valuable 'cause they been created by God
And God makes you valuable
And whether or not you recognize that value is one thing
You got a lot of societies and governments
Tryin' to be God, wishing that they were God
They wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere
And make you think they got the all-seeing eye
Eh, I guess The Last Poets wasn't too far off
When they said that certain people got a god complex
I believe it's true
I don't get phased out by none of that, none of that
Helicopters, the TV screens, the newscasters, the satellite dishes
They just wishing
They can't really never do that
When they tell me to fear they law
When they tell me to try to have some fret in my heart behind the things that they do
This is what I think in my mind
And this is what I say to them
And this is what I'm saying to you check it

Keep your boots laced if you wanna keep pace

Ask them originals 'cause they know

Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Say my name, say my name...
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently laid down and paved my game
My own two raise my flame, 'cause dickridin' ain't my thang!
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now, I'm gettin' it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings
When y'all was askin' permission, I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kids better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year, the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin', then get money now
'Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin' — as usual, some cats won't heed it
The hard-headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame they jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day, or make it a long evenin'
You keep on schemin', man, gimme some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screamin' ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than y'all 'cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down, it's gotta be botherin' y'all
Pay attention, watch Flaco get larger than y'all
Pour your pride on the rocks, and make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do-or-die stay rumblin' and bubblin' hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all

By the way yo, everybody say ho
Everybody say hooooo- hooo
Everybody say ho

Who is the cat dining out on the town
And make the whole dining room turn they head round

He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Who be riding up in the high rise elevator
Other tenants who be prayin that he ain't the new neighbor
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
They try to play him like a chump cause he got what they want

He under thirty years old but already he's a pro
Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll'
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show
(Yes y'all) the best crib, the best clothes
Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze (say word)
Checks with Os, o-o-o-o-ohs
Straight all across the globe, watch got three time-zones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes
One problem; even with the Os on his check
The po-po stop him and show no respect
""Is there a problem officer?"" Damn straight, it's called race
That motivate the jake (woo-woo) to give chase

But they'll say it out loud again
When they get with they close associates and friends
You know, sneak it in with they friends at the job
Happy hour at the bar, while this song is in they car
And even if it's never said and lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like, late night I'm on a first class flight
The only brother in sight, the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat, 2C
She approach officially, talking about, ""Excuse me""
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed, put an extra lime in my water glass (So sorry)
An hour later here she come by, walkin' past
""I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph""
Wow.. (I saw you roll your eyes, Mr. Nigga I love your albums!..)
They stay on nigga patrol on American roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane, go where they please
But I go overseas and I get over-seized
London, Heathrow, me and my people
They think that illegal's a synonym for negro
Far away places, customs agents flagrant
They think that dark faces smuggle weight in they cases
Bags inspected, now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalysis followed by X-rays
Interrogated and detained 'til damn near the next day
No evidence, no apology, and no regard
Even for the big American rap star
For us especially, us most especially
A Mr. Nigga VIP jail cell, just for me
(If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake)
Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face
They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful
You start keeping pace, they start changing up the tempo
Now, who is cat riding out on the town (Ha ha)
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill (What, what say word)
They gotta send it to the lab to make sure the shit is real
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
Nigga Nigga.. Nigga

You can laugh and criticize Michael Jackson if you wanna;
Woody Allen molested and married his step-daughter
Same press kicking dirt on Michael's name
Show Woody and Soon-Yi at the playoff game (Holding hands)
Sit back and just bug, think about that
Would he get that type of dap if his name was Woody Black?
O.J. found innocent by jury of his peers
And they been fucking with that nigga for the last five years
Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right?
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white?
If white boys doing it, well, it's success
When I start doing it, well, it's suspect
Don't hate me, my folks is poor, I just got money
America's five centuries deep in cotton money
You see a lot of brothers caked up, yo straight up
It's new, y'all livin off of slave traders' paper
But I'm a live though, yo I'm a live though
I'm puttin up the big swing for my kids, yo
Got my mom the fat water-front crib, yo
I'm a get her them pretty bay windows
I'm a cop a nice home to abide in
A safe environment for seeds to reside in
A fresh whip for my whole family to ride in
And if I'm still Mr. Nigga, I won't find it suprisin'9Embed 93 ContributorsBrooklyn Lyrics
Hey, hey! Haha! Say what, say what?
Haha! Hahaha! Bust it, yo!
Sometimes, I feel like I don't have a partner
Sometimes, I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, this beautiful Brooklyn
Long as I live here, believe I'm on fire, hey

'Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day

Bust it!
Sometimes, I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by, and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was spry and young
I used to try and come to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little somethin'
When I was just a youngin', before the days of thuggin'
How me and Charlie Chims, and yo, what?! I'm only buggin'
Fast forward — 9, now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin' the now space and time, 'round the nine-to-five
For as long as I'm alive, pah, I gotta strive
I ain't sittin roadside, that ain't part of the plan
I'm out here for my fam', doin' all that I can
I love my city! Sweet and gritty, inland to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown 'cause we prone to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mine? I touch back
Walk the streets like ya sweet, and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes, over Jakes (Woop-Woop!), we bust back
Bring the marty to your face with no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game, clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin' to hunt that, recurrin' dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first hardest, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the Dutch many years ago
Three million strong, and here we go!

Yo, sometimes, I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep-dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push your wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Fulton and Jay got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro cardin' it
Thugs mobbin' it, form partnership, increase armament
Street pharmacists — deep consequence
When you seek sleek ornaments, you get caught
Rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real, yo, but still, yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Outta-towner's take the train, plane and bus here
Must be somethin' that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
They shout out, ""Go Brooklyn!"" — they representin' it
Sittin' on they front stoop, sippin' Guinness's
Usin' native dialect in they sentences
From the tree-line blocks to the tenements
To the Mom and Pop local shop businesses
We travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we call it 'The Planet'
Not a borough or a province, our style is uncommon
From Sumner to Tompkins to Lafayette Gardens
Wyckoff, Gowanus, in they army jacket linings
Yo, this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya, goin' wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The '90s, and all my yarda Trini Brownsvillers
Parkside tennis courts; 30's, 40's and the 50's
The cats out in Starrett City gettin' busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Canarsie
Farragut, Fort Greene and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals and armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be playin' loud and long, B
If you love Bucktown strongly
Raze it up!
Brooklyn — my habitat, the place where it happen at
Lives sway in the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the News Two crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, the summertime jam is at
They play B.I.G. and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustlin', you can't relax
The crack babies tryin' to find where they mamas at
It's off the handle, black, with big police scandals that
Turn into action screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'Lo gear is at
The stompin' grounds where you find the pound smokers that
Be Blazin' John, that have your wave cap floatin' back
The doorstep where the dispossessed posted at
Dope fiends out on Franklin Ave. sellin' Zovirax
You big ballin'? Better keep your money folded back
'Cause once the young guns notice that, it's over, black!
""Brooklyn keep on takin' it!"" — worldwide we known for that!
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat!13Embed 62 ContributorsLove Lyrics
They say that goodness in life belongs to those who believe:
So, I believe. Yes

I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish

My pop said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, wasn't game or promotion
The entire affair's probably charged with emotion
When love call your heart I guess you got to pursue
12-11-73, my life is testament
Praise the beneficent, element that breath
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Projects
It was a bright valley with some dark prospects
In '83, Vendy C was the host with the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Aiyo, power from the streetlight made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spending time, writing rhymes
Trying to find words that describe the vibe
That's inside the space
When you close your eyes and screw your face
Is this the pain of too much tenderness?
To make me nod my head in reverence?
Should I visit this place in remembrance?
Or build landmarks here as evidence?
Nighttime, spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
And we believe in the promise
(Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love)
Yes, yes, y'all, and we don't stop because

(Watch it) Relax, pump the brakes
You're speeding, money
You'll smash your whole shit up (slow down)
Lights be changing fast on these streets, money, slow down
(Slow down) Sleeping on the wrong cats

Clear like a megaphone
Pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
Rocked the Trump Tower to the terrordome
Poor house to pleasure domes
Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone
Mos Def; one of the illest that you ever known
Rock steady baby, you a stepping stone
Smash your foundation into pebbles
My words leave your nerves unsettled
You take it to the next level down
Looking like a circus clown
Cats like you can't even get a pound
Worldwide from the river to lakeside
My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive
I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
Superheroes
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
""I feel it,"" you can taste it through the speakers
The three six oh-riginal sketch lyrics so visual
They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video

Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Stay on time like Omegas
Brooklyn patrol like interstaters
Take their license and their registration papers

My joint's so passionate
Make you peel out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but akh' you can't be too upset
Tow truck got my tape in the deck
I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnhardt
Stay on the low like the herb spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2K can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated
Believe it
Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother
Conference call you wack crew and tell each other
That they just ain't holding me
I'm Mos Def, you hopefully
Mush on before you get bust on like a ovary
Tell them cats they need to ease back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on, no off-ramp or detour

Make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law

Loud and clear, bright and early
Listen!

I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock way above the game
To be point blank witchu — motherfuck the game!
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dawg, not to Def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not the dude
I'm grown man business, I am not in school
Put your hand down, youngin', this is not for you
On my J-O with beats by Kanye, yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh like I'm still a day old
And it's been like that since the day 0

From the jungles of the Empire State, where it ain't no escape
247, 718, and that's like every night, every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the States, I'm collectin' my pay
Blast off, then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro-ball, not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised
(Let the sun shine)
Like a long time man of the way
You understandin' me straight? (Let the sunshine in)
Yes, yes, no doubt! Excellence
It's what it is, it's what it is, and that's what it is, you see?

Ha! Fire!!

'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God, and involve with niggas
These elements help evolve my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn — it don't matter if ya holler or whisper
You comin' through clear, 'cause I'm right here witcha
Ain't gotta edit your slang — I got it, I get ya

The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggas
Rebel guerrillas to ghetto civilians
Y'all gon' feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra, ordinary and plain
I walked a thousand paces of life ahead of the game
By the time that you get where I'm standin', I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move wrong

I move in, and y'all must move on, 'cause I'm molto strong
And I know what my feet move for (Let the sunshine in)

Don't give a fuck about what brand you are (The sun's shinin')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles and standards are
You understand me, y'all?
Be good to your family, y'all
No matter where your families are
'Cause everybody need family, y'all
Raise a hand if you understand me, y'all
Everybody need family, y'all

Understand, no matter where your families are

Now his belly full and he about to flood somethin'
So I'm throwin' rope that ain't tied to nothin'
Tell your crew use the H2 in wise amounts since
The New World Water; and every drop counts
You can laugh and take it as a joke if you wanna
But it don't rain a full week some summers
And it's about to get real wild in the half
You be buying Evian just to take a fuckin bath
Heads is acting wild, sippin' poor, puffin' dank
Competin' with the next man for higher playin' rank
See I ain't got time tryin' to be Big Hank
Fuck a bank; I need a twenty-year water tank
Cause while these knuckleheads is out here sweatin' they goods
The sun is sitting in the treetops, burnin' the woods
And as the flames from the blaze get higher and higher
They say, ""Don't drink the water! We need it for the fire!""

Poor so hard, my clean clothes look grimy, pretty women don't mind me
So what's fifty grand to a young nigga like me? More than my annual salary
Poor so hard, this shit crazy, walk outside the whole world hate me
Nervous stares at the thoroughfare, surveillance cameras, police tracing
Poor so hard, this shit weird, we be home and still be scared
There's grief here, there's peace here, easy and hard to be here

There's birds of prey, no escape, open-air prison, local zoo
Poor so hard, who getting faded? Little Maurice in the sixth grade
No mama, no father, role model the dope game, say
Poor so hard, bitch behave, standing behind the deuce-deuce-trey
Ice-cold, heat blow, closed casket, cold case

Poor so hard, that shit cray

These young bloods is looking scary at the mall

They rob a nigga in the bathroom stall
They took his life cause he ain't want to take it off

""Ah.. ah-ah, ah-ah.. ah-ah, ah-lert the squad..""
Rock and roll
(Huh) My grandmomma was raised on a reservation
(Huh) My great-grandmama was, from a plantation
They sang - songs for inspiration
They sang - songs for relaxation
They sang - songs, to take their minds up off that
Fucked up situation
I am, yes I am, the descendant (yes yes)
Of those folks whose backs got broke
Who fell down inside the gun smoke
(Black people!) Chains on their ankles and feet
I am descendants of the builders of your street
(Black people!) Tenders to your cotton money
I am hip-hop
""It's heavy metal for the black people""
I am rock and roll (rock and roll, rock'n'roll)
Been here forever
They just ain't let you know (HA!)
I said, Elvis Presley ain't got no soul (huh)
Chuck Berry is rock and roll (damn right)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't come up with that style on they own (uh-uh)
Elvis Presley ain't got no soul (hell naw)
Little Richard is rock and roll (damn right)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't come up with that shit on they own (nah-ah)
You might also likeGuess that's just the way shit goes
You steal my clothes and try to say they yours (yes they do)
Cause it's a show filled with pimps and hoes
Trying to take everything that you made or control (there they go)
Elvis Presley ain't got no soul
Bo Diddley is rock and roll (damn right)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't the first place the credit belongs
Say whoa-oh (don't take it)
Oh-we-oh (black music)
Whoa-oh (don't take it)
Oh-we-oh (black music)
Whoa-oh (Jimi Hendrix say)
Oh-we-oh (black music)
Whoa-oh (Albert King and)
Oh-we-oh (and Motown)
I ain't trying to diss
But I don't be trying to fuck with Limp Bizkit (""The fuck is on your mind?"")
When I get down in my zone
I be rockin Bad Brains and Fishbone
I ain't tryin to slow your groove
But that ain't the way I'm trying to move
I don't turn on Korn to get it on;
I be playing Jimi Hendrix 'til the dawn
That's my word is bond
Sitting up on my front lawn
Got the volume turned to ten
Playing Albert King the best again (black)
When the morning in the cooker
Got to turn on some John Lee Hooker
When I want some rock and roll
Go to Otis Redding to get some soul
Say, James Brown got plenty of soul
James Brown like to rock and roll
He can do all the shit fo' sho'
That Elvis Presley could never know (black people)
Said, Kenny G ain't got no soul
John Coltrane is rock and roll (uh-huh)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they could never ever rock like Nina Simone

Say whoa-oh (don't take it)
Oh-wee-oh (black music)
Whoa-oh (don't take it)
Oh-we-oh (black music)
Whoa-oh (don't take it)
Oh-we-oh (black music)

You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But everything they did they stole
Elvis Presley ain't got no soul

Yo, we be the most magnetic, so athletic

Take the arch rivalry stance up on the podium
And give the flavor to niggas but keep it low on sodium
Possess shit that got you wondering how we holdin 'em
Things that'll lay you out like a piece of linoleum
Bring who-ever you want, we bout to bug, son, and bounce
Down to Henry Hudson, after I bust one!

""One thing I want to assure them
If they think I'm gonna change or compromise
My attitude and my way of life or
In my expression or in my goal
Towards politics
They are making me stronger
And I am much more stronger now""
Bang to the boogy
Say up jump the boogy
To the rhythm of the boogity beat
To the rhythm of the boogity beat

There it go like simple the plainness, it's primal and basic
Zulu arrangement rockin' amazement
Flaco, radiating from heaven to pavement
They phony as a facelift, I’m nothing to play with
Spent time hating it but that ain't changing it
God give it to me, nobody is takin' it
Therefore, moving on the base for stimulus
I'm standing in the twilight and watching them get it in
The walls are tremblin', the air is simmering
She movin' like more than her ears are listenin', whoa now
Testin' your equilibrium
Sonic wave booming all over your intimate
Skin on skin and skin on skin again
Put it all, get it all, get on, get it in
Ladies and gentlemen, misters and mistresses
Cousins, uncles, aunties, and synonyms, there it is, boogieman

I strike the empire back
I strike the empire back
Fuck the empire
High flying like the Millenium Falcon piloted by Han Solo
I never roll for dolo, fronting on me's a no-no
Understand, doing this for my family
Ha ha, check it out y'all

Yo, I'm trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up, told my daddy I'd be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon' switch hand
Get today's solid ground out of yesterday's quicksand
I was a young boy who dreamt about being a big man
On small looseleaf sheets, I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly, boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but nowaday it's time for me
The streets is watching me, I watch back, that's the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seekin' the North beacon
From beating and hog-eating, from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding, cotton thorns in your palms
It's for y'all that I sketch these songs, and it goes
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man, because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go mano-a-mano
Kweli is you with me (What up, what up)
Let's make it happen
I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow, looking for a brighter day
When y'all wanna leave y'all
Right away

Never disrespect no women 'cause I love my momma
These cats be giving us praise but it ain't that accurate
I give it up to God, all that love and attachment get
Scary well-prepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies
And singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to 'em clearly
Y'all don't hear me though, even when I'm coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo, why you starting me
I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent with the tears and sweat and what I bleed
MCs imitate the way we walk, the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off
You come across soft
Back in the days niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guestlist
It's like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it, MCs in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you know it's only 'cause I love you
Shout it out from East-West
(From South to Northern)
From the richest (to the poorest)
To the elders (in the coffins)
Living native (dying for it) understand
And know that I love you
Yea, yea, we got love in the place
Shout out from up top (to the middle)
To black bottom (sky high!)
Whether you colder than December
Or hotter than July
It don't stop til we complete this
And know that I love you

Kweli say, ""Everybody act according to the season that they born in""
Some in the night, some in the morning, some at noon
Some in winter, some in June
It's all cool, it's the natural
Science is a jewel
For me and mines, yours and you
Let's move, tell you a little bit about mine, yo

I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold
Celebrations were going on
Some were happy, some were sad
Some felt bad from being good
Some felt good from being bad, feelings pass and change
But they never leave, they here to stay
Holiday, holiday, happy birthday
Teenage love, the first cut run deep
Soul on flesh, this is the Brooklyn streets
Year of the Ox, seven and three
M.D., the history (come on)
Every soul got one of these (yes)
It's where you been and where you be
And without understanding you cannot proceed
Complete, the start and the end
Then it just go round again

Again and again, brand new
Again and again, so fresh
Again and again, newness

I was born in the decade of decadence where they worshipped what they have
Ford was president, do the math
The war was ended when the North Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like, bye, we was gone, let bygones be bygones
I'm gone, spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Where they hug you with the firearm, try it on
Like new school clothes, Black Star official
Smash when we do a show, it's facts, no mystery
I'm down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with the Roots like the Giving Tree
Powerful, bigotry at work, me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We get it poppin' like a hit chorus
The flow is historic, they can't get rid of us
Ubiquitous, and we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history so they missing us

And don't call it a comeback in particular
Even if it blend into ephemera or
Fade into peripheral, transmission of the ministers' origin
Over broadcast clear without diminishing
Black Star stovetop burning soul temperatures, administers
Alkalines, aminos and minerals: essentials
Served over Dilla time signatures
It's miracle material, remember it's right now foreverness3Embed",rap,male

I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do

I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me, how can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?
And how can you mend this broken man? Yeah
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again, la-la, la-la, la

And misty memories of days gone by

You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river and wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul? Put my feet on the ground

I don't know why she treated me so bad

And I can't eat a bite
I guess I'll never be free
Since you got, your hooks, in me
Oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah

I ain't never loved a man

I'm only one step ahead of heartbreak
One step ahead of misery
One step is all I'd have to take backwards
To be the same old fool for you I used to be

I'm only one step ahead of your arms
One kiss away from your sweet lips
I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
'Cause I'm just out of reach of your fingertips

Your warm breath on my shoulder
Keeps reminding me
That it's too soon to forget you
It's too late to be free, can't you see?

I'm only one step ahead of your love
I try and yet I can't take two
Seems like I'll have to take that one step backwards
'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
'Cause one step ahead is a step too far away from you
Just one step ahead is a step too far away from youYou might also like8Embed 14 ContributorsAin’t No Way Lyrics
Ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me
It ain't no way for me to give you all you need
If you won't let me give all of me
I know that a woman's duty
Is to help and love a man
And that's the way it was planned
Oh, but how can I, how can I, how can I
Give you all the things I can
If you're tying both of my hands?

Oh, oh, it ain't no way (Ain't no way)
It ain't no way (Ain't no way)
It just ain't no way, baby (Ain't no way)
Ain't no way, baby (Ain't no way)
It ain't no way for me to love you
If you won't let me

Stop trying to be someone you're not
Hard, cold, and cruel is a man
Who paid too much for what he got
And if you need me like you say, say that you do
Oh, then please, please, please
Don't you know that I need you?

He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
You trust your heart, share all of your love
'Til death do you part

When he wants it and whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feeling love starved
I'll be there to feed it
I'm loving him a little bit more each day

Listen, dear

And a rose is still, and always will be, a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo

There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
She never knew what hit her, oh
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

32,Clarence Carter,"7 ContributorsPatches LyricsI was born and raised down in Alabama
On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule
You might also likeSo every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""
Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through
'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""
Though years have passed and all the kids have grown
The angels took mama to a brand new home
Lord knows, people, I shedded tears
But my daddy's voice helped me through the years
Sayin':
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""
Oh, I could still hear papa's voice sayin':
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""
I could still hear papa when he's saying:
""Patches, I'm depending on you, son
To pull the family through

And I stroke it to the west
And I stroke it to the woman that I love the best
I be strokin'
Let me ask you somethin'
What time of the day do you like to make love?
Have you ever made love just before breakfast?
Have you ever made love while you watched the late, late show?
Well, let me ask you this
Have you ever made love on a couch?
Well, let me ask you this
Have you ever made love on the back seat of a car?
I remember one time I made love on the back seat of a car
And the police came and shined his light on me, and I said:
""I'm strokin', that's what I'm doin', I be strokin""
I stroke it to the east
And I stroke it to the west
And I stroke it to the woman that I love the best

Now when I start making love to my woman

And I can always tell when she gets sas-ified
'Cause when she gets sas-fied she start calling my name
She'd say: ""Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter
Clarence Carter, ooh shit, Clarence Carter""
The other night I was strokin' my woman
And it got so good to her, you know what she told me
Let me tell you what she told me, she said:
""Stroke it, Clarence Carter, but don't stroke so fast
If my stuff ain't tight enough, you can stick it up my...""

I'm gonna rap to ya a little bit
About two feelings that we all know about
And they are
Loneliness & Temptation
Now I know, at sometime or the other, everybody gets lonely
And when you're lonely, you sit at home
Watch the telephone, hopin' it would ring
Or you turn on your favorite DJ
Hopin' that he might play something that would ease your mind
But when none of these things come about
You go out, and you start searchin'
And that's when you meet Temptation
Well, I know what I'm speaking about, because
Something happened to me a few months ago
I never expect it to happen, I didn't look for it
But when I found it, I really did like it
Maybe this song will explain what I mean

I went over
To see my friend yesterday
His old lady told me
He was gone away
You might also likeShe said she was burning
With desire
And she wanted me
To put out the fire

I got caught
Making love
To another man's wife
Yes, I did
Y'all ain't gonna believe me
But I got caught
Making love
To another man's wife
Yes, I did
She told me
To step inside the door
And then she reached over
And turned the lights way down low
And before I knew
What was goin on
She was in my arms
And suddenly
Her old man
Walked through the door!

Now I know
What I did
Was a shame and a sin
But if I had the chance
And wasn't in this hospital
I'd do it all again!

I'ma tell all you men out there!
Don't ever get caught
Making love
To another man's wife!
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah...Embed 5 ContributorsBack Door Santa LyricsThey call me Back Door Santa

And that's something

But tell me how far

And even lets it show?
He pulled on your hair
And rubbed on your face
And even had the nerve
To ask the color of your lingerie

Tell me what was I supposed to do
When he disrespected me
And he disrespected you?
Creating a scene
Is not my prescription
For protecting my woman
Against male intervention
He bought you drinks
And gave you invitations to his table
He insisted on dancing with you
When I said you weren't available

Is one thing I demand
And I won't stand no teasin'

Were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us
In a shack just like our shack
We worked in the fields together
And we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land
You don't have the time to think about another man's color
They sit out on the front porch
In the evening when the sun went down
Willie would play and Laura would sing
And the children would dance around
I'd bring 'em out my guitar
And we'd play into the night
And every now and then, ol' Willie would grin and say
""Boy, you play all right""
Ha, ha, ha
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time
Yeah, the cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
Aha, but that was another place and another time
I remember when Willie would hitch the mules up
When Sandy rolled around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
""Hey, y'all want something from town?""
He'd say no, but why don't y'all stop back on your way home
I'll get Laura Mae to cook up some corn bone

And went our separate ways
And it sure was hard to say goodbye
To Willie and Laura Mae (Jones, y'all)
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time

'Til I saw Willie downtown the other day
I said, ""Y'all stop by tonight, we can sit down and eat a bite
We'd love to see your children and Laura Mae""

And spoke with his eyes so kind
He said this is another place and another time

Better than me
Been told I can't be nothin' else

Got to be mellow, y'all

Hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by

Just move on up
Toward your destination
Though you may find, from time to time
Complication

Bite your lip
And take the trip
Though there may be wet road ahead
And you cannot slip

Just move on up
For peace you'll find
Into the steeple of beautiful people
Where there's only one kind

So hush now, child
And don't you cry
Your folks might understand you
By and by

Move on up
And keep on wishin'
Remember your dream is your only scheme
So keep on pushin'

Take nothing less
Than the supreme best
Do not obey rumors people say
For you can pass the test

Just move on up
To a greater day
With just a little faith, if you put your mind to it
You can surely do it
Just move on up
Move on up
But move on up
Oh, child, but just a-move on up
But move on up
Move on up24Embed 23 ContributorsThe Makings of You Lyrics
Add a little sugar, honeysuckle and
A great, big expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn’t miss with a dozen roses
Such would astound you
The joy of children laughing around you
These are the makings of you
It is true, the makings of you

The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told them so
You're second to none

The love of all mankind
Should reflect some sign
Of these words I've tried to recite
They are close, but not quite
Almost impossible to do
Reciting the makings of you

The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told them so

Last night, I was so depressed
And I went and got the Bible
And I turned to the book of Revelations
And if people would just get and read the Bible
And read the book of Revelations
They would really turn around and straighten up
This is all we need to do, is just get the good book
And read it and put it to everyday life

Sisters
Niggers
Whiteys

Don't worry
If there's hell below
We're all
Gonna go

Darkest of night with the moon shining bright
There's a set goin' strong; lotta things goin' on
The man of the hour has an air of great power
The dudes have envied him for so long

Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die
Ah-ha-ha

Hard to understand what a hell of a man
This cat of the slum had a mind, wasn't dumb
But a weakness was shown cause his hustle was wrong
His mind was his own but the man lived alone

Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why
The only game you know is do or die

Tryin' to get over

Woo, Super Fly, huh, huh

The aim of his role was to move a lot of blow
Ask him his dream: what does it mean? He wouldn't know
""Can't be like the rest"" is the most he'll confess
But the time's running out and there's no happiness

Oooh, Super Fly
You're gonna make your fortune by and by
But if you lose, don't ask no questions why

Hey, hey
Lord, Lord
Yeah, yeah
Ah, ha
Freddie's dead
That's what I said
Let the man rap a plan
Said he'd sing him home
But his hope was a rope
And he should've known

It's hard to understand
There was love in this man
I'm sure all would agree
That his misery
Was his woman and things
Now Freddie's dead --
That's what I said

Everybody's misused him
Ripped him off and abused him
Another junkie plan
Pushin' dope for the man
A terrible blow
But that's how it goes
A Freddie's on the corner now

Welfare

A hard sacrifice
I wanna testify, staying a loving man
Society gave me no choice, tried to silence my voice
Put my woman on the welfare
I'm so tired, I'm so tired of trying to prove
My equal rights
Though I've made some mistakes
For goodness sakes
Why you gonna keep messing up my life?

Keep away from me, Mr. Welfare
Keep away from me, keep away, keep away
Mr. Welfare
Ohhh

Holding me back, using your tax
To make me kneel against my will
That's how it go
Why, I don't know, I don't believe

Like the private eye for the FBI
Just as envious as the Klu Klux Klan
Though I'm a passing fate
And I'm trying to escape

Because it eats me all up inside

Just another day, trying to make a way
All I see outside of me is crime
What can I do to make it through
Ain't gonna say nobody's crying
I got a woman, true
And a baby too
With a love that grows and grows and grows
Here come the bills, there go the thrills
And a job, all doors are closed

Keep away from me, Mr. Welfare

We people who are darker than blue
Are we gonna stand around this town
And let what others say come true?
We're just good for nothing, they all figure
A boyish, grown-up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?

We people who are darker than blue
This ain't no time for segregatin'
I'm talking 'bout brown and yellow, too
High yellow gal, can't you tell
You're just the surface of our dark, deep well?
If your mind could really see
You'd know your color the same as me
Pardon me, brother, as you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story

Get yourself together, learn to know your sign
Shall we commit our own genocide
Before you check out your mind?
I know we've all got problems
That's why I'm here to say
Keep peace with me and I with you
Let me love in my own way

Now I know we have great respect
For the sister and mother, it's even better yet
But there's the joker in the street
Loving one brother and killing the other
When the time comes and we are really free
There'll be no brothers left, you see

We people who are darker than blue
Don't let us hang around this town
And let what others say come true
We're just good for nothing, they all figure
A boyish, grown-up, shiftless jigger
Now we can't hardly stand for that
Or is that really where it's at?

Pardon me, brother, while you stand in your glory
I know you won't mind if I tell the whole story
Pardon me, brother, I know we've come a long, long way
But let us not be so satisfied
For tomorrow can be an
An even brighter day2Embed 12 ContributorsSo in Love Lyrics

That's why I know this feelin' good and strong

I want to testify, you mean so much to me
Let me write the fact, I mean it honestly

Life is strange, believe me it is true
We don't always mean the things we sometimes do
Look at me, look at you
You know we're so in love

Baby, don't ask why
You're movin' my emotions
So in love

You don't have to worry

Lose the faith and it will swallow you
Loving you is what I'll always feel
Never ever doin' things against our will
Nothing is, nothing required, any kind of cares

How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

Porched up in a rocking-chair
With my feet all bare
Rolling my blunt in a cigar wrap
Live an adolescent mind
Never do take the time
Waiting for my high, quiet as it's kept

How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

Mama told me I was best
Argue and punch in my chest
""Son, now be strong, let me take you home""
I'd see in her eyes so sincere
Screaming, what got me here
Standing in the world and with my mind all blown

Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone

I do nothing but waste all my time
Leaving the world behind
Smoking my crack just to keep me high
Around the boys I play my part rough
Keep myself tough enough
Never to cry
Don't really want to die

How did I get so far gone?
Where do I belong?
And where in the world did I ever go wrong?
If I took the time to replace
What my mind erased
I still feel as if I'm here but I'm gone
How did I get so far gone?

And where in the world did I ever go wrong?

Darkness no longer, a child is born
Mother shed tears of joy as baby test his lungs
My daddy's not there where he ought to be
Somewhere in Georgia, skinning and shooting craps on his knees
Another victim born out here in the hood
And based on statistics it really ain't all good
Welfare takes the tab and daddy can't sign
And it can't be seen, the family becomes a crime
The hunt is on and brother you're the prey
Serving time in jail, it just ain't the way
I'm living so hard, baby, that my hair is gray
We got to make a change, it's a brand new day

A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race

Operation influx and it's on the way
We've just marched a million plus the other day
Look we all witnessed the sweat rolling down Ms Liberty's head
She knows the sleeping giant is no longer sleeping dead
Oh, what a fulfillment of prophecy
Let us teach the children freedom's never been free
It's okay to cry, go ahead and cry
'Cause Jesus wept but hope and faith he kept

Sister Mary don't you weep, tell Martha not to moan
We need the love and daddy's coming home
There's no need to worry, the times dictate a plan
Mother Earth's given birth to a brand new man
Sister I know you're misunderstood
But hold on to your man 'cause the future looks good
It's a new day

A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race

Beware of the lies and false prophecies
We are many with eyes but don't all really see
You must be merciful, my friend, to obtain the same
So if you break the chain don't pass the blame
We should say unto all and I'll say it again
It's not just to win, shake a hand, make a friend
We who are pure at heart somehow might see
There's still light in the world, come rejoice with me
It's a new day

I've met many people over the years
And in my opinion I have found that
People are the same everywhere
They have the same fears
Shed similar tears
Die in so many years
The oppressed seem to have suffered the most
In every continent - coast to coast
Now our lives are in the hands of The Pusherman
We break it all down
In hopes that you might understand how to protect yourself
Don't make no profit for The Man

I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me

There's somethin' kinda funny
How The Man take your money
He's shrewd as he can be
In such a way you'll never see
It's a terrible thing inside
When your natural high has died
The weaker turn to dope
And put all aside their hope

My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me

Twinkling twinkling grains
They do all sorts of things
While your inner mind is pleased
Your conscience is only teased...

More and more you feed
Until you grow another need
Playing fantasy
You have no reality

I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
Sit down and take a listen
This may be something that you're missin'
I know your mind, you want it funky
But you don't have to be no junkie

Just be glad you've got your own
So glad that I can see

I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shine
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town

It's hard to do right
In this filthy night
Just plain simple comfort
Is completely out of sight

Praying to Jesus make me a little stronger
So I might live the life a little bit longer
So many changes going in and out of my life
How can anyone survive
When everybody's been made a sacrifice
Look all around and see yourself so weak and so vulnerable
So you're trying to be strong but your money ain't too long
And it's so terrible
Don't you know if you want a good life
Best look into yourself
'Cause the world is cold and everybody's bold
And there's no one else
Time makes you suffer when seasons change
Can't call no names
When you got your own self to blame
Strain won't give me no satisfaction
Taxes are taking up a new collection
So many changes going in and out of my life
How can anyone survive
When everybody's been made a sacrifice

I don’t know
Don’t think that I’m any saint ’cause
I can’t do nothin’ for you
I only asked of you just as I got to do myself
Look into your inner self only you know how to be
Free
If you wanna grin let it smile
Feel a little happy go on and dance a while
Can nobody play down God’s lovin’ child
‘Cause when the spirit hits you you got to move
And just as He made us one of many
Then aren’t the many of us maybe only one
Surely can you be the rising sun but
The depth of night the light for sight
Sort of sets the moral standards of soul
Gives you the strength to pay the price of life
And rewards you with a bit of fulfillment
The definition of true He is more real than you
Isn’t he?
Almighty Doctor must have been a heavenly man
JESUS!
Lot of inspiration all over this land Jesus
In spite of your fears you can shed happy tears
Jesus!
Don’t care what you call Him none can befall Him
Hear me say Amen! Amen! Amen! Hear me say
Amen!
Now stand up and clap your hands
Amen! Amen! Amen! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Travelin’ Soul the way the story goes
We all know He was crucified
But what He gave us never will die!
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time!
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’
You need courage in time of fear
Because of undyin’ news you hear
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
Strength in time of new temptation
Don’t want to lose a love relation
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’
And drinkin’ and drinkin’
You might also likeThe world I see before me is tryin’ to make me a slave
Jesus!
Than to see many children hungry
I’d rather go to my grave Jesus!
The lovin’ way of life
Has terribly been arranged Jesus!
Something’s mighty mighty wrong
And it seems awful strange
Just like a back up gear there are those in fear
Of falling near we who are already here
Look-a-here, look-a-here, look-a-here
You need courage in time of fear
Because of undyin’ news you hear
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
Strength in time of new relations
Don’t want to lose a love relation
Talk about Jesus talk about Jesus
He never had a hustlin’ mind

And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up, baby, and

Ooh-ooh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue

Don't you know that

I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Oh, I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey, yeah (Heard it through the grapevine, not much longer would you be my baby)

I know a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears, I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life, you see

Flying high in the friendly sky
Flying high without ever leaving the ground, no
Rest of the folks are tired and weary
Oh Lord, and have laid their bodies down
I go to the place where danger awaits me
And it's bound to forsake me
So stupid minded
I can't help it, so stupid minded
But I go crazy when I can't find it
In the morning, I'll be alright, my friend
But soon the night will bring the pains
The pain, awful pain

Flying high in the friendly sky
Without ever leaving the ground
And I ain't seen nothing but trouble baby
Nobody really understands, no, no
And I go to the place where good feeling awaits me
Self destruction's in my hand
Oh Lord, so stupid minded
Oh, but I go crazy when I can't find it
Well I know I'm hooked my friend
To the boy who makes slaves out of men
And oh, believe me

Distant lover, lover (Lover, lover, lover)
Ooh, so many miles away, ooh
Heaven knows that I long for you
Every night, every night and sometimes I yearn through the day

Distant lover, ooh (Lover, lover, lover), lover

Please, please baby, think about me sometimes
Think about me here, here in misery
(Save me, baby, save me, baby, save me, baby)
Misery (Please, save me, baby, please)

(Baby) As I reminisce, ah baby
Through our joyful summer together
(Oh, baby) The promises we made
All the daily letters
Then all of a sudden
Everything seemed to explode (Wow)
Now I gaze out my window
Sugar, down a lonesome road

Distant lover (Lover, lover, lover), ooh sugar
How can you treat my heart so mean and cruel? Didn't you know, sugar
That every moment that I spent with you (Every moment)

You were my wife, my life, my hopes and dreams
For you to understand what this means, I shall explain
I stood all the jealousy, all the bitching too
Yes, I'd forget it all once in bed with you
Oh darling, how could we end up like this?
Oh baby, let me reminisce

Oh and when we, woo, stopped the hands of time
You set my soul on fire, my one desire
Was to love you and think of you with pride
And keep you satisfied, oh baby, oh baby
We could not bear the mental strain
Leave you, I never meant to
Now you see how much you hurt me
But if you ever need me, I'll be by your side
Though the many happy times we had
Can really never outweigh the bad
Oh, I'll never love nobody like I loved you baby

It's time for us to say farewell
Farewell my darling
Maybe we'll meet down the line
It's too late for you and me
It's too late for you and I
Much too late for you to cry
It's too late for you and me

You know
When you say your marriage vows
They're supposed to be for real, I mean
If you think back about what you really said, you know, about honor, and loving and obeying until death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it shouldn't be lies because though, it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you've lied to God
The words should be changed

Ooh, now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again, again and again (And that isn't all)
And that isn't all, I gave my love to you
Each time to make amends (Ooh, baby)
Suddenly, I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away
I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay
For leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart, as long as you want me to, baby
Ooh, if I love again, I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did
Some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger

You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me with all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part

I really tried
You know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried
All of those promises was nothin' but lies
But I really tried
You know how hard I tried, really tried
(All that rehearsing, baby)
We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that, you have scandalized my name (Ooh)

What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me in to the police? (Ooh)
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could
You were so divine
And your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe (All the luck in the world)
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world (All the good love in the world)
Good luck in the world (Ooh)
But I know you'll never be satisfied (Luck in the world)
No, you still want me standin' by your side (Good love in the world)
Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side;
You've said bad things and you've lied
Still, I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared, baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was
To love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby
Take a lesson from it all (Ooh, hey, come on, come on, come on)
I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best
You say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?

Kiss my petals, weave me through a dream

For all of these simple things and much more, a flower was born
It blooms to spread love and joy, faith and hope to people forlorn
Inside every man lives the seed of a flower
If he looks within he finds beauty and power

Ring all the bells, sing and tell the people everywhere that the flower has come
Light up the sky with your prayers of gladness and rejoice for the darkness is gone
Throw off your fears, let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born

Birds sing out of tune, songs with no refrain
Nested in purple trees, nothing seems to rhyme

Only when I'm dreaming
Is there harmony and meaning
Only when I'm dreaming of you

Yesterday is here
Now will never pass

Only when I'm dreaming
Is there harmony and meaning
I am only dreaming when I'm

The ripples run into the sun
And your smile blends with the clouds that flutter by me
As I sit on the edge of a dream

And there is love enough for each and everyone
As I sit on the edge of a dream
That's what I see! That's what I see!

If we look we just might see (Just might be)

Merry-go-round without a sound
I hear your song in the breeze that rock-a-byes me
As I sit on the edge of a dream

Seconds pass so very fast

Love you through the sands of time

Love can span the hands of time

Yes, time is a treasure that we cannot buy
Time measures a life, and I don't know why
My Love, before I met you I could not give
Then you touched my heart
And you taught me to live

Blowing softly through a meadow, laughing like a baby, breeze
(Baby breeze, baby, breeze, baby, breeze)
Tapping lightly at the treetops, whispering among the leaves
(Through the leaves, through the leaves, through the leaves)

You hear the magic song that ancient poets sing, hey, yeah
It's sweet as morning dew, and sounds a lot like springtime

(When you close your eyes) you feel your heart go there
So close your eyes and you may find that
Fireflies were as bright as stars - close your eyes and remember
Summertime lingered on and on - close your eyes and remember
Your first love made the world stand still - close your eyes and remember
Close your eyes and remember
Close your eyes and remember (Remember when...)
The moon was made of cheese

Racing swiftly through the mountains, bubbling along the stream
(Down the stream, down the stream, down the stream)
Sighing sweetly through the hollow, gentle as an infant's dream
(Baby's dream, baby's dream, baby's dream)

Stars, they come and go
They come fast, they come slow
They go like the last light of the sun
All in a blaze
All you see is glory
But it gets lonely there
When there's no one there to share
You can shake it away
If you'll hear a story

People lust for fame
Like athletes in a game
They break their collarbones
And come up swinging
Some of them are crowned
Some of them are downed
Some are lost and never found
But most have seen it all
They live their lives
In sad cafés and music halls
And they always have a story

Some make it when they're young
Before the world has done its dirty job
And later on someone will say
""You've had your day
Now you must make way"" (Don't they always?)
But you'll never know the pain
Of using a name you never owned
The years of forgetting what you know too well
You might also like
That you who gave the crown
Have been let down
You try to make amends
Without defending

Perhaps pretending
You never saw the eyes
Of young men at twenty-five
Who followed as you walked
Asked for autographs
Kissed you on the cheek
You never could believe
They really loved you, never
Some make it when they're old
Perhaps they have a soul
They aren't afraid to bare
Perhaps there's nothing there

But anyway
That isn't what I meant to say
I meant to tell about a story
Since we all have stories
But I can't remember it anyway
So I'll tell about the mood that's in the United States today
And permeating even Switzerland
It goes
But I'll continue anyway until I get it together
Some women have a body
Men would want to see
And so they put it on display
Some people play a fine guitar
I could listen to them play all day
But anyway
I'm trying to tell my story
Janis Ian told it very well
Janis Joplin told it even better
Billie Holiday even told it even better
We always, we always
We always have a story

The latest story that​ I know
Is the one that I'm supposed to go out with
And the latest story that I know

Do what you gotta do
Come on back, see me when you can

Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start
It's my own fault what happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

So you just do what you gotta do, my wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind, find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feel no good
I guess they got no way to know
I've had my eyes wide open from the start
And man you never lied to me
The part of you that they'll never see
Is the part you've shown to me

So you just do what you gotta do, my wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind, find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can2Embed 9 ContributorsI Loves You Porgy Lyrics

Say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only
I'd rather be lonely than happy with somebody else

You might find the night time the right time for kissing
Night time is my time for just reminiscing
Regretting instead of forgetting with somebody else
There'll be no one unless that someone is you
I intended to be independently blue
I want your love, don't wanna borrow
Have it today to give back tomorrow
Your love is my love
There's no love for nobody else

Say, love me or leave me and let me be lonely
You won't believe me but I love you only

Gave myself in that misty light
Was hypnotized by a strange delight
Under a lilac tree

Do things I never should do
I drink much more than I ought to drink
Because it brings me back you
Lilac wine is sweet and heady like my love
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady like my love
Listen to me, I cannot see clearly
Isn't that he coming to me nearly here?
Lilac wine is sweet and heady, where's my love?
Lilac wine, I feel unsteady, where's my love?

She shut all the doors, she cut off the lights
She holds me and squeeze me tight
She tells me, ""Big O, everything's all right""

And I go dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Play it again, dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Do it again, dum, dum, deedle dee, dum dum
Come on now, those happy songs, happy, happy songs

I was too blind, I could not see, now

In a little tent
Oh, and just like the river, I've been runnin'
Ever since

Rolling along, rolling along, rolling along
Mmm, old man river, that old man river
He don't say nothing, but he must know something
For old man river, he just keeps rolling along

Mmm, he don't plant taters, he don't plant cotton
And them that buy some, they're soon forgotten
While old man river, he just keeps rolling along

Mmm, you and me, we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge and lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

I get weary and sick of trying
I'm tired of living but afraid of dying
While old man river he just keeps rolling along
Rolling along, rolling along, rolling along

You and me, we sweat and strain
Body all aching and racked with pain
Tote that barge, lift that bale
Get a little drunk and you land in jail

As around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Always)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Always)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Always)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Did you know you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)
Until the trees and seas just up and fly away (Loving you)
Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four (Loving you)
Until the day that is the day that are no more (Loving you)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Be loving you)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (Loving you)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Loving you)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Now ain't that loving you?)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Ain't that loving you?)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (And I've got to say always)

Isn't she lovely?
Isn't she wonderful?
Isn't she precious?
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love, we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Isn't she pretty?
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love


Isn't she lovely?
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely, made from love

Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, it's something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget, no
For there's Basie, Miller, Satchmo
And the king of all, Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose

You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration
'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you
And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday

I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition
Because it should never be
Just because some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion
And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing

Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong, moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city

And you can bet, he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe, she hardly gets a penny

Thanks a lot. 
Wow, New York, just like I pictured it. 
Skyscrapers and everything. 
Hey, hey brother, hey come here slick. (Huh?)
Hey you look, you look hip man. 
Hey, you wanna make yourself five bucks man? (Yeah)
You look hip, run this across the street for me right quick. 
Okay, run this across the street for me. 
What? Huh? I didn't know! What?
Gimme your hands up you punk!
I'm just going across the street. 
Put that leg up, shut your mouth. 
Hell no, what did I do?
Okay, turn around, turn around. 
Put your hands behind your back, let's go, let's go. 
A jury of your peers having found you guilty, ten years. 
What?
Come on, come on, get in that cell, nig​ger. 
God, Lord. 
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution
Living just enough, just enough for the city

I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel, nowhere could be much colder
If we don't change, the world will soon be over
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park, I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight, there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one

Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You, too, might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You, too, might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me
You might also like
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know?
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You, too, like I
Overjoyed, over loved, over you

Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind, felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet

There's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more

We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers' tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
And I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
You might also like
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
That knocks me off my feet

I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling, I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh, but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling, I don't want to—8Embed 18 ContributorsDo I Do Lyrics
When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud

Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?

When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane

Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
Baby

Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love

Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss

I know the record's about to end
But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So, if you don’t like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothing but a penny and you'll have a cough
I know I cannot rhyme cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I ha ha ha ha h-ha ha ha
Now everybody's talking about the jive is in
Well, I know I've got something for your body

Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon's in the sky for our love
If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love

Do...Do
Do Do Do Do Do
HMM HMM

This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love
We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love

Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek, it's really you, my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

We are undercover passion on the run, yeah
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers

La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la, la, la, la, la

My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the Milky Way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine

La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la, la, la, la, la
La-la, la, la, la, la

Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine

You made my soul a burning fire
You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you, girl
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true
'Cause all I do is think about you

All I do is think about you (Thinking 'bout you, baby)
All I do is think about you

Baby, just suppose I should happen to cross your mind
And by some chance, a boy like me you're really been trying to find
Well, let me tell you, girl
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel like me
If you should discover this dream is for two
Well, I'm gonna tell you, girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new

If I cannot have you for my own
I'd rather be lonely and all alone
I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do

Good morn' or evening, friends
Here's your friendly announcer
I have serious news to pass on to everybody
What I'm about to say
Could mean the world's disaster
Could change your joy and laughter to tears and pain

It's that love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far

The force of evil plans to make you its possession
And it will if we let it destroy everybody
We all must take precautionary measures
If love and peace you treasure
Then you'll hear me when I say, woah-oh

That love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
Hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop it please before it's gone too far
People, you know that love's in need of love today

You know that hate's, hate's goin' 'round breaking many hearts
Stop, stop it please before it's gone too far
It's up to you 'cause love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's, hate's goin' 'round
Breaking, hate's tried to break my heart many times
Don't, you've got to stop it please before, before, before
Love's in need of love today
Don't delay, send yours in right away
You know that hate's goin' 'round, hate's goin' 'round
Hate's goin' around and it tried breaking up many hearts
You've got to, I've got to, they've got to, we've got to, they've got to, we've got to stop it before it's gone too far
