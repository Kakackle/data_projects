Let's stay together

I, I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do is alright with me
'Cause you make me feel so brand new
And I want to spend my life with you

Let me say that since, baby, since we've been together
Ooh, loving you forever is what I need
Let me be the one you come running to
I'll never be untrue

Ooh, baby, let's, let's stay together
Lovin' you whether
Whether times are good or bad, happy or sad

I can think of younger days when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do

I could never see tomorrow
I was never told about the sorrow

And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
Tell me, how can you stop that old sun from shining?
What makes the world go 'round?
And how can you mend this broken man? Yeah
How can a loser ever win?
Somebody please help me mend my broken heart
And let me live again, la-la, la-la, la

I can still feel the breeze that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by

But we could never see tomorrow
Would you believe that no one, no one ever told us about the sorrow?

I'd like to dedicate this song to little Junior Parker
A cousin of mine who's gone on, but we'd like to kinda carry on in his name
I sing

I don't know why I love you like I do
After all these changes that you put me through
You stole my money and my cigarettes
And I haven't seen hide nor hair of you yet

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

Take me to the river and wash me down
Won't you cleanse my soul? Put my feet on the ground

I don't know why she treated me so bad
Look at all the things that we could have had
Love is a notion that I can't forget
My sweet sixteen I will never regret

I wanna know, won't you tell me
Am I in love to stay?

The sixteen candles are burning on my wall
Turning me into the biggest fool of them all

I wanna know, can't you tell me

Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Daydreaming and I'm thinking of you
Look at my mind floating away

He's the kind of guy that would say
Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go some place, huh
Where, I don't care
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
You trust your heart, share all of your love
'Til death do you part
I want to be what he wants
When he wants it and whenever he needs it
And when he's lonesome and feeling love starved
I'll be there to feed it
I'm loving him a little bit more each day
Turns me right on when I hear him say

Hey, baby, let's get away
Let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we

And a rose is still, and always will be, a rose
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm
Dooby dooby doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo mmm

There was a rose I knew, I done met her once or twice before
She was a pretty sweet thing, not the least bit insecure
Then you came with your slick game and played with her youth
Unashamed of the way you lied and played with the truth, hey hey
She never knew what hit her, oh
Steal her honey, then forget her
Now the rose is scorned
She wears a thorn, tryin' to forget about you

She's cryin', you can't hear her

On a farm way back up in the woods
I was so ragged the folks used to call me ""Patches""
Papa used to tease me about it
'Course deep down inside he was hurt
'Cause he'd done all he could
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
See, education he never had
He did wonders when the time got bad
The little money from the crops he raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh, life had kicked him down to the ground
When he tried to get up life would kick him back down
One day papa called me to his dyin' bed
Put his hands on my shoulders and in tears he said
He said:
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son, it's all left up to you""
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
So I told mama I was gonna quit school
But she said that was daddy's strictest rule
You might also likeSo every morning fore I went to school
I fed the chickens and I chopped wood too
Sometimes I felt that I couldn't go on
I wanted to leave, just run away from home
But I would remember what my daddy said
With tears in his eyes on his dyin' bed
He said:
""Patches, I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest""
Then one day a strong rain came
And washed all the crops away
And at the age of thirteen I thought I was carrying
The weight of the whole world on my shoulders
And you know, mama knew what I was going through
'Cause every day I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way we got our meals
See, I was the oldest of the family
And everybody else depended on me
Every night I heard my mama pray:
""Lord, give him strength to make another day""

And I stroke it to the west
And I stroke it to the woman that I love the best

Let me ask you somethin'
What time of the day do you like to make love?
Have you ever made love just before breakfast?
Have you ever made love while you watched the late, late show?
Well, let me ask you this
Have you ever made love on a couch?
Well, let me ask you this
Have you ever made love on the back seat of a car?
I remember one time I made love on the back seat of a car
And the police came and shined his light on me, and I said:
""I'm strokin', that's what I'm doin', I be strokin""
I stroke it to the east
And I stroke it to the west
And I stroke it to the woman that I love the best

You make it hard, long, soft, short

And I can always tell when she gets sas-ified
'Cause when she gets sas-fied she start calling my name
She'd say: ""Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter, Clarence Carter
Clarence Carter, ooh shit, Clarence Carter""
The other night I was strokin' my woman
And it got so good to her, you know what she told me
Let me tell you what she told me, she said:
""Stroke it, Clarence Carter, but don't stroke so fast
If my stuff ain't tight enough, you can stick it up my...""

I'm gonna rap to ya a little bit
About two feelings that we all know about
And they are
Loneliness & Temptation
Now I know, at sometime or the other, everybody gets lonely
And when you're lonely, you sit at home
Watch the telephone, hopin' it would ring
Or you turn on your favorite DJ
Hopin' that he might play something that would ease your mind
But when none of these things come about
You go out, and you start searchin'
And that's when you meet Temptation
Well, I know what I'm speaking about, because
Something happened to me a few months ago
I never expect it to happen, I didn't look for it
But when I found it, I really did like it
Maybe this song will explain what I mean

I went over
To see my friend yesterday
His old lady told me
He was gone away
You might also likeShe said she was burning
With desire
And she wanted me
To put out the fire

I got caught
Making love
To another man's wife
Yes, I did
Y'all ain't gonna believe me
But I got caught
Making love
To another man's wife
Yes, I did
She told me
To step inside the door
And then she reached over
And turned the lights way down low
And before I knew
What was goin on
She was in my arms
And suddenly
Her old man
Walked through the door!

Now I know
What I did
Was a shame and a sin
But if I had the chance
And wasn't in this hospital
I'd do it all again!

I'ma tell all you men out there!
Don't ever get caught
Making love
To another man's wife!

Were our neighbors a long time back
They lived right down the road from us
In a shack just like our shack
We worked in the fields together
And we learned to count on each other
When you live off the land
You don't have the time to think about another man's color
They sit out on the front porch
In the evening when the sun went down
Willie would play and Laura would sing
And the children would dance around
I'd bring 'em out my guitar
And we'd play into the night
And every now and then, ol' Willie would grin and say
""Boy, you play all right""
Ha, ha, ha
The cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
But that was another place and another time
Yeah, the cotton was high and the corn was growing fine
Aha, but that was another place and another time
I remember when Willie would hitch the mules up
When Sandy rolled around
We'd always stop by Willie's house and say
""Hey, y'all want something from town?""
He'd say no, but why don't y'all stop back on your way home
I'll get Laura Mae to cook up some corn bone

Darkness no longer, a child is born
Mother shed tears of joy as baby test his lungs
My daddy's not there where he ought to be
Somewhere in Georgia, skinning and shooting craps on his knees
Another victim born out here in the hood
And based on statistics it really ain't all good
Welfare takes the tab and daddy can't sign
And it can't be seen, the family becomes a crime
The hunt is on and brother you're the prey
Serving time in jail, it just ain't the way
I'm living so hard, baby, that my hair is gray
We got to make a change, it's a brand new day

A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race

Operation influx and it's on the way
We've just marched a million plus the other day
Look we all witnessed the sweat rolling down Ms Liberty's head
She knows the sleeping giant is no longer sleeping dead
Oh, what a fulfillment of prophecy
Let us teach the children freedom's never been free
It's okay to cry, go ahead and cry
'Cause Jesus wept but hope and faith he kept
It's a new day

The die has been cast and there's no need to fear
'Cause people, the answer to your prayers are here
Sister Mary don't you weep, tell Martha not to moan
We need the love and daddy's coming home
There's no need to worry, the times dictate a plan
Mother Earth's given birth to a brand new man
Sister I know you're misunderstood
But hold on to your man 'cause the future looks good
It's a new day

A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race
A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race

Beware of the lies and false prophecies
We are many with eyes but don't all really see
You must be merciful, my friend, to obtain the same
So if you break the chain don't pass the blame
We should say unto all and I'll say it again
It's not just to win, shake a hand, make a friend
We who are pure at heart somehow might see
There's still light in the world, come rejoice with me
It's a new day
A new world order, a brand new day
A change of mind for the human race

Crawlin' through the trees
Stuck in mud up to the knees
Fightin' this damn war
Wonderin' if the Lord knows what it's for
Six long years stretch
And we boys was in a hell of a mess
I gotta keep my mind; take it slow
Fightin' hard for what I don't know

I wanna get back home, gotta get back home
Back to the world

I had a talk with little mom
Strenuous face as she began to hum
She said: Boy, it's good to see ya
My prayers must've been with ya
And now that you're back and done
Let me tell ya, son

I've met many people over the years
And in my opinion I have found that
People are the same everywhere
They have the same fears
Shed similar tears
Die in so many years
The oppressed seem to have suffered the most
In every continent - coast to coast
Now our lives are in the hands of The Pusherman
We break it all down
In hopes that you might understand how to protect yourself
Don't make no profit for The Man

I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me

There's somethin' kinda funny
How The Man take your money
He's shrewd as he can be
In such a way you'll never see
It's a terrible thing inside
When your natural high has died
The weaker turn to dope
And put all aside their hope

My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me

Twinkling twinkling grains
They do all sorts of things
While your inner mind is pleased
Your conscience is only teased...

More and more you feed
Until you grow another need
Playing fantasy
You have no reality

I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The man can't put no thing on me
Sit down and take a listen
This may be something that you're missin'
I know your mind, you want it funky
But you don't have to be no junkie

Just be glad you've got your own
So glad that I can see
My life's a natural high
The Man can't put no thing on me
I'm so glad I've got my own

I'm from the other side of town
Out of bounds
To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shine
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store
On the other side of town

It's hard to do right
In this filthy night
Just plain simple comfort
Is completely out of sight

She hungry for bread to eat
My brother's hand-me-down shoes
Is now showing his feet

To anybody who don't live around
I never learned to share
Or how to care
I never had no teachings about being fair

Depression is part of my mind
The sun never shine
On the other side of town
The need here is always for more
There's nothing good in store

A lot of scars that kind of scare you to remember
Scufflin' times in seeing people trying to put you down
For goodness sakes
People trying to take what you know you've found
Stranded in someone else's neighborhood
Listening to the undertone
Lord! Sure makes it a blessing to know you got your own
Time makes you suffer when seasons change
Can't call no names when you got your own self to blame
Praying to Jesus make me a little stronger
So I might live the life a little bit longer
So many changes going in and out of my life
How can anyone survive
When everybody's been made a sacrifice
Look all around and see yourself so weak and so vulnerable
So you're trying to be strong but your money ain't too long
And it's so terrible
Don't you know if you want a good life
Best look into yourself
'Cause the world is cold and everybody's bold
And there's no one else
Time makes you suffer when seasons change
Can't call no names
When you got your own self to blame
Strain won't give me no satisfaction
Taxes are taking up a new collection
So many changes going in and out of my life
How can anyone survive
When everybody's been made a sacrifice

I don’t know
Don’t think that I’m any saint ’cause
I can’t do nothin’ for you
I only asked of you just as I got to do myself
Look into your inner self only you know how to be
Free
If you wanna grin let it smile
Feel a little happy go on and dance a while
Can nobody play down God’s lovin’ child
‘Cause when the spirit hits you you got to move
And just as He made us one of many
Then aren’t the many of us maybe only one
Surely can you be the rising sun but
The depth of night the light for sight
Sort of sets the moral standards of soul
Gives you the strength to pay the price of life
And rewards you with a bit of fulfillment
The definition of true He is more real than you
Isn’t he?
Almighty Doctor must have been a heavenly man
JESUS!
Lot of inspiration all over this land Jesus
In spite of your fears you can shed happy tears
Jesus!
Don’t care what you call Him none can befall Him
Hear me say Amen! Amen! Amen! Hear me say
Amen!
Now stand up and clap your hands
Amen! Amen! Amen! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Travelin’ Soul the way the story goes
We all know He was crucified
But what He gave us never will die!
He never had a hustlin’ mind
Doin’ crime wastin’ time!
Drinkin’ that wine
Drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’ and drinkin’

Oh, the dark days are done, and the bright days are here

You know
When you say your marriage vows
They're supposed to be for real, I mean
If you think back about what you really said, you know, about honor, and loving and obeying until death do us part and all
But it shouldn't be that way, it should, it should, it shouldn't be lies because though, it turns out to be lies
If you don't honor what you said, you've lied to God
The words should be changed

Ooh, now as I recall, we tried a million times
Again, again and again (And that isn't all)
And that isn't all, I gave my love to you
Each time to make amends (Ooh, baby)
Suddenly, I start to realize I can't make it
Pretty birds fly away
I had to leave you for my health's sake
What to do? Make you pay
For leaving you, my fine, is to pay forever
So if a fresh new love comes in, I won't say those words again
Instead I'll say I'll try to love and protect you
With all my heart, as long as you want me to, baby
Ooh, if I love again, I'm gonna try a new way this time
Memories of the things we did
Some we're proud of, some we hid
So when two people have to part, sometimes it makes them stronger
You might also likeDo you remember all of the bullshit, baby? Yeah, yeah
You say you love me with all your heart
If you ever loved me with all of your heart
You'd never take a million dollars to part

I really tried
You know I tried, oh baby
Although we tried
All of those promises was nothin' but lies
But I really tried
You know how hard I tried, really tried
(All that rehearsing, baby)
We really lied, didn't we baby?
And on top of that, you have scandalized my name (Ooh)

What I can't understand is if you love me
How could you turn me in to the police? (Ooh)
Didn't I love you good and try to take care of you?
Best I could
You were so divine
And your love was like mellow wine
Pains of love, miles of tears, enough to last me for my lifetime
Broken hearts last for years, so break away to the new-day sunshine
One thing I can promise, friend; I'll never be back again
But I'm not really bitter, babe (All the luck in the world)
I wish you all the luck and all the love in the world (All the good love in the world)
Good luck in the world (Ooh)
But I know you'll never be satisfied (Luck in the world)
No, you still want me standin' by your side (Good love in the world)
Memories haunt you all the time
I will never leave your mind
Got judgment on your side;
You've said bad things and you've lied
Still, I remember some of the good things, baby
Like love after dark and picnics in parks
Those are the days I'll not forget in my life
I'd rather remember, remember the joy we shared, baby
I'd rather remember all the fun we had
All I ever really wanted was
To love you and treat you right
All we did was fuss and fight
It don't matter baby
Take a lesson from it all (Ooh, hey, come on, come on, come on)
I never thought I'd see the day when
You'd put me through what you put me through
You tried your best
You say I gave you no rest

When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?
When did you stop loving me?
When did I stop loving you?

Throw off your fears, let your heart beat freely at the sign that a new time is born

When he looks into my eyes and sees down to my soul
It's so hard for me to tell if this is just desire
Or the love I need to make my spirit whole
How am I to know?
Now I ain't lookin' for a man to hold me for an hour
I ain't lookin' for a man to love me for a day
Every time he comes around I get the funny feelin'
What I'm looking for don't matter anyway
Hey, it don't matter anyway
'cause every since I was a child
I dreamed about my baby's smile
It scares me so to say
I wanna be with him in the worst darn way
Cause every time he comes around I feel like I'm on fire
When he whispers in my ear I start to lose control
Still it's so hard for me to tell if this is just desire
Or the love I need to make my spirit whole

Cause ever since I was a child
I dreamed about my baby's smile

The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam
And I mean every word of it

Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi, goddamn
Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi, goddamn
Can't you see it, can't you feel it
It's all in the air
I can't stand the pressure much longer
Somebody say a prayer

Alabama's gotten me so upset
Tennessee made me lose my rest
And everybody knows about Mississippi, goddamn
(This is a show tune, but the show hasn't been written for it, yet)

Hound dogs on my trail
School children sitting in jail
Black cat cross my path
I think every day's gonna be my last
You might also likeLord have mercy on this land of mine
We all gonna get it in due time
I don't belong here, I don't belong there
I've even stopped believing in prayer
Don't tell me, I'll tell you
Me and my people just about due
I've been there so I know
They keep on saying ""Go slow!""

But that's just the trouble (Too slow)
Washing the windows (Too slow)
Picking the cotton (Too slow)
You're just plain rotten (Too slow)
You're too damn lazy (Too slow)
The thinking's crazy (Too slow)
Where am I going, what am I doing
I don't know, I don't know
Just try to do your very best
Stand up, be counted with all the rest
For everybody knows about Mississippi, goddamn
(I bet you thought I was kidding, didn't you)
Picket lines, school boycotts
They try to say it's a communist plot
All I want is equality
For my sister, my brother, my people, and me
Yes, you lied to me all these years
You told me to wash and clean my ears
And talk real fine just like a lady
And you'd stop calling me Sister Sadie
Oh but this whole country is full of lies
You're all gonna die and die like flies
I don't trust you any more
You keep on saying ""Go slow!""
""Go slow!""

But that's just the trouble (Too slow)
Desegregation (Too slow)
Mass participation (Too slow)
Reunification (Too slow)
Do things gradually (Too slow)
But bring more tragedy (Too slow)
Why don't you see it, why don't you feel it
I don't know, I don't know
You don't have to live next to me
Just give me my equality
Everybody knows about Mississippi

Stars, they come and go
They come fast, they come slow
They go like the last light of the sun
All in a blaze
All you see is glory
But it gets lonely there
When there's no one there to share
You can shake it away
If you'll hear a story

People lust for fame
Like athletes in a game
They break their collarbones
And come up swinging
Some of them are crowned
Some of them are downed
Some are lost and never found
But most have seen it all
They live their lives
In sad cafés and music halls
And they always have a story

Some make it when they're young
Before the world has done its dirty job
And later on someone will say
""You've had your day
Now you must make way"" (Don't they always?)
But you'll never know the pain
Of using a name you never owned
The years of forgetting what you know too well
You might also like
That you who gave the crown
Have been let down
You try to make amends
Without defending

Perhaps pretending
You never saw the eyes
Of young men at twenty-five
Who followed as you walked
Asked for autographs
Kissed you on the cheek
You never could believe
They really loved you, never
Some make it when they're old
Perhaps they have a soul
They aren't afraid to bare
Perhaps there's nothing there

But anyway
That isn't what I meant to say
I meant to tell about a story
Since we all have stories
But I can't remember it anyway
So I'll tell about the mood that's in the United States today
And permeating even Switzerland
It goes
But I'll continue anyway until I get it together
Some women have a body
Men would want to see
And so they put it on display
Some people play a fine guitar
I could listen to them play all day
But anyway
I'm trying to tell my story
Janis Ian told it very well
Janis Joplin told it even better
Billie Holiday even told it even better
We always, we always
We always have a story

The latest story that​ I know
Is the one that I'm supposed to go out with
And the latest story that I know
Is the one that I'm supposed to go out with
And the latest story that I know
Is the one that I'm supposed to go out with

Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free

I've loved you better that your own kin did
From the very start
It's my own fault what happens to my heart
You see I've always known you'd go

So you just do what you gotta do, my wild sweet love
Though it may mean that I'll never kiss those sweet lips again
Pay that no mind, find that dappled dream of yours
Come on back and see me when you can

Now I know it'll make you feel sad
And make you feel so bad
They say you don't treat me me like you should
They got ways to make you feel no good
I guess they got no way to know

And man you never lied to me

For old man river, he just keeps rolling along

Mmm, he don't plant taters, he don't plant cotton
And them that buy some, they're soon forgotten
While old man river, he just keeps rolling along

As around the sun, the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early May
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing, will grow older every day
Just as all is born is new
Do know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Always)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream

Did you know that true love asks for nothing?
Her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day?
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always
As today, I know I'm living, but tomorrow
Could make me the past, but that, I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always

Until the day that is the day that are no more (Did you know you're loved by somebody?)
Until the day the earth starts turning right to left (Always)
Until the earth just for the sun denies itself (I'll be loving you forever)
Until dear Mother Nature says her work is through (Always)
Until the day that you are me and I am you (Always)
Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Always)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Always)

We all know sometimes life's hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your life times that and twice its double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helping to make this earth a place sometimes called Hell
Change your words into truth and then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great-grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you

Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky (Loving you)
Until the ocean covers every mountain high (Loving you)
Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea (Loving you)
Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream (Be loving you)
Until the day is night and night becomes the day (Loving you)

Through us, He's given life to one
But isn't she lovely? Made from love

Looking back on when I was a little nappy-headed boy
Then my only worry was for Christmas, what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes would not get a thing
We were happy with the joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door to hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door with, ""Boy, thought I told you not to go outside""
Tryin' your best to bring the water to your eyes
Thinking it might stop her from whoopin' your behind

I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go?
'Cause I love them so

Brother said he's telling 'bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell and I'll give you anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (You nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall
You grow up and learn that kind of thing ain't right
But while you were doing it, it sure felt outta sight

No chocolate-covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact, here's just another ordinary day

No April rain, no flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, it's something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you

I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart

No summer's high, no warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze, no falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies

No Libra sun, no Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old, so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do

Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance, and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move

They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people, go

Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers

Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park, I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight, there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block

Didn't know you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin', jam on

They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun
You might also like
Didn't know that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the the break of dawn
We're jammin', jammin', jammin', jam on

You ask me, am I happy?
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star

You didn't know that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, oh no, no, no, baby, baby
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Na, no, na na, na na na
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
No, no, no, baby, nobody told you, oh, oh, oh, you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you if someone approached you
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin'
You would not believe it
Because you never thought that you'd be jammin'
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Jammin' 'til the break of dawn
Oh, oh
You may as well believe what you are feeling
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Because you feel your body jammin'
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn

See the girl with the diamonds in her shoes? Yeah
She walks around like she's got nothin' to lose
Yeah, she's a go-getter, she's everybody's type
She's a queen of the city but she don't believe the hype
She's got her own elevation, holy motivation
So I wrote some letters out in big bold type

I got faith in you, baby
I got faith in you now
And you've been such a, such a good friend to me
Know that I love you somehow
I met you, hallelujah, I got faith

See the boy with the Stevie Wonder swag?
Ain't got a clue all the magic that he has
He's a go-getter, he's everybody's type
I'ma make it my mission, make him feel alright
He's a twelve on a ten point, rockin' out to his joint
Just say the word 'cause I could sing all night

I got faith (Faith) in you, baby

Over time, I've been building my castle of love
Just for two, though you never knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far for you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away
Over dreams, I have picked out a perfect come true
Though you never knew it was of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You, too, might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me

Over hearts, I have painfully turned every stone
Just to find I had found what I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I've sought can never be mine

And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You, too, might be
Overjoyed, over loved, over me
You might also like
And though the odds say improbable
What do they know?
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You, too, like I

Told only to the wind, felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin' 'bout your love
That makes me weak and

We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers' tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
And I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble

Seems to drive my head insane

To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me, I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's ""discreet"" with part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek, it's really you, my part-time lover
