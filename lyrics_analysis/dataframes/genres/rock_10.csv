Finished with my woman
'Cause she couldn't help me with my mind
People think I'm insane
Because I am frowning all the time

All day long I think of things
But nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind
If I don't find something to pacify

Can you help me
Occupy my brain?
Oh yeah

I need someone to show me
The things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness
I must be blind

You might also like
Make a joke and I will sigh
And you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel
And love to me is so unreal

And so, as you hear these words
Telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life
I wish I could but it's too late54Embed",https://images.genius.com/46514480a048fb777f012318a43be54f.1000x1000x1.jpg

I am Iron Man

Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves, will he fall?

Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?


He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
For the future of mankind

Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl

Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved

Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge

Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again

Robot minds of robot slaves
Lead them to atomic graves
Plastic flowers, melting sun
Fading moon falls upon
Dying world of radiation
Victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of obscene fire
Like electric funeral pyre

To earth's cracking ground

Clouds cry for the dead

Into impending doom

Is God alive or is God dead?
Is God dead?

Rivers of evil, run through dying land
Swimming in sorrow, they kill, steal, and borrow

Give me more wine
I don’t need bread

They burned down the gambling house
It died with an awful sound
Funky Claude was running in and out
Pulling kids out the ground
When it all was over
We had to find another place
But Swiss time was running out
It seemed that we would lose the race

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky
Smoke on the water

We ended up at the Grand Hotel
It was empty, cold and bare
But with the Rolling-truck-Stones-thing just outside
Making our music there
With a few red lights, a few old beds
We made a place to sweat
No matter what, we get out of this
I know, I know we'll never forget

Smoke on the water
And fire in the sky

I have often told you stories
About the way
I lived the life of a drifter
Waiting for the day
When I'd take your hand
And sing you songs
Then maybe you would say
""Come lay with me and love me""
And I would surely stay

But I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance
Like the sound
Of a windmill going around
I guess I'll always be
A soldier of fortune

Many times I've been a traveler
I looked for something new
In days of old
When nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here

Now I feel I'm growing older
And the songs that I have sung
Echo in the distance

And my world is pale
When a blind man cries

Had a good time
But it ended much too soon
In a cold month, in that room
We found a reason
For the things we had to do

Enjoy a little paradise

When Lucy met the rocket
She never knew the reason why

From her Austin to her Bentley

The golden light above you shows me where you're from
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon
You stand up on your hill, they bebop all around you
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah
They wonder where I found you

Oh, my love, it's a long way
Where you're from it's a long way

I tried to understand you, tried to love you right
The way you smile and touch me always sets my heart alight
Your lips are like a fire burning through my soul
And people ask me where you're from
They really wanna know

Oh, my soul, it's a long way
Where you're from it's a long way

Magic woman wrecking up my soul
Things you tell me have never been told
Magic woman I don't know
Electric before me, I love you, so I love you so

But now I'm coming with you down the road of golden dust

Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow, how you wanted it to be
I'm over my head, out of her head, she sang

And I wonder
When I sing along with you

If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You gotta promise not to stop when I say when

Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in

And if I give it a twist
Somethin' to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find somethin' in there?

I needed somewhere to hang my head
Without your noose
You gave me something that I didn't have
But had no use

Too strong to lose

But I break loose
My head is giving me life or death

Look who's buying all their tickets to the game

There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to Heaven
There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, makes me wonder

There's a feeling I get when I look to the West
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking

Ooh, it makes me wonder
Ooh, really makes me wonder

It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on

And it makes me wonder
Ohh, woah

Your head is humming, and it won't go, in case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow? And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?

And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our soul
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one, and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll

With love in her eyes and flowers in her hair

Took my chances on a big jet plane
Never let 'em tell you that they're all the same
Oh, the sea was red, and the sky was grey
Wondered how tomorrow could ever follow today
The mountains and the canyons start to tremble and shake
The children of the sun began to awake (watch out)

Seems that the wrath of the gods
Got a punch on the nose, and it started to flow
I think I might be sinking
Throw me a line, if I reach it in time
I'll meet you up there where the path runs straight and high

To find a queen without a king
They say she plays guitar and cries and sings... La la la la
Ride a white mare in the footsteps of dawn
Tryin' to find a woman who's never, never, never been born
Standing on a hill in my mountain of dreams
Telling myself it's not as hard, hard, hard as it seems, mm...

Run 'round, sweet baby, Lord, how they hypnotize

Gonna love you, baby, here I come again

Every day I work so hard, bringing home my hard-earned pay
Try to love you, baby, but you push me away

The Queen of Light took her bow
And then she turned to go
The Prince of Peace embraced the gloom
And walked the night alone
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The dark Lord rides in force tonight
And time will tell us all
Oh, throw down your plow and hoe
Rest not to lock your homes
Side by side we wait the might of the darkest of them all
Oh-oh

I hear the horses' thunder down in the valley below
I'm waiting for the angels of Avalon
Waiting for the eastern glow

The apples of the valley hold the seeds of happiness
The ground is rich from tender care
Repay, do not forget, no, no
Dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The apples turn to brown and black
The tyrant's face is red
Oh, war is the common cry
Pick up your swords and fly
The sky is filled with good and bad
Mortals never know, oh

The woe of aftermath
The drums will shake the castle wall
The ring wraiths ride in black, ride on
Sing as you raise your bow (Ride on)
Shoot straighter than before
No comfort has the fire at night
That lights the face so cold
Oh, dance in the dark of night
Sing to the morning light
The magic runes are writ in gold
To bring the balance back
Bring it back

At last the sun is shining
The clouds of blue roll by
With flames from the dragon of darkness
The sunlight blinds his eyes!

I got so high, I scratched 'til I bled
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do? (Ooh, ooh)

I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
I can't complain (Ooh, ooh)
I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do?
The black sheep got blackmailed again
Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong, so what should I do? (Ooh, ooh)

I'm on a plain (Ooh, ooh)
I can't complain (Ooh, ooh)

To write off lines that don't make sense
Love myself better than you

Except for the heart-shaped hole where the hope runs out

Shock me awake and tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Prisoner of sleep, deeper down
The rabbit hole, never to be found
Again

Where are you hiding, my love?
Cast off like a stone; feelings
Raw and exposed
When I'm out of control
Pieces were stolen from me
Or dare I say, given away
Watching the water give in as I go down the drain
I appear missing now

I go missing, no longer exist

Cut me loose
Nowhere to run, no more room to pretend
Wandering along the road in the summer night

I go missing, no longer exist
One day, I hope I'm someone you'd miss

Shock me awake, tear me apart
Pinned like a note in a hospital gown
Deeper asleep, further down
The rabbit hole never to be found

And drank a potion, baby, to erase you
Face down in the boulevard, yet I couldn't face you
There ain't no use in cryin'
It doesn't change anything, so, baby, what good does it do?
Your friends, they all sympathize, maybe I don't need them to

Imagined I'd be your one and only
Instead, I'm the lonely one
You, me, and a lie
Silence is closer, we're passing ships in the night

There's nowhere to run away
Said, ""Boy, if you want love, you'll have to go and find it with someone new
Do you know who you really are, are you sure it's really you?""
Lies are a funny thing
They slip through your fingertips because they never happened to you
Time wounds all the heals as we fade out of view

Instead I'm the lonely one

The love line in your hand
Cleverly disguised
All the promises of stone
Crumble in the light

Ah!
Oh, yeah

It's all in motion, no stoppin' it now
I got nothing to lose and only one way up
I'm burnin' bridges, I destroy the mirage
All visions of collisions, fuckin' bon voyage

It's all smooth sailin' from here on out, yeah

I got bruises and hickeys, stitches and scars
Got my own theme music, plays whenever I yawn
Fear is the hand that pulls your strings
A useless toy, pitiful plaything
I'm in flagrante
In every way, everyday

It's all smooth sailin' from here on out
I'm gon' do the damage that needs getting done, yeah

Well, God only knows one long vacation
If reason is priceless, there's no reason to pay for it
(It's so easy to see) yet so hard to find
Make a mountain of a molehill, if, if the molehill is mine

I hypnotize you, ignore, then defy you
I blow my load over the status quo, here we go
I'm a little bit nonchalant when I dance
I'm riskin' it all-ways, no second chance

It's gonna be smooth sailin' from here on out, yeah
I'm gon' do the damage 'til the damage is done, yeah

Well, God only knows, so mind your behavior
Follow prescriptions of your loaded savior
(Every temple needs gold) Every hook needs to shine
Hell is at the temple of the closed mind
Closed mind
Closed mind
Closed blinds

(Ah, shut up, shut up)
It's all smooth sailin' from here on out
Oh, shut up

I miss you now, what's come over me?
We're hostages of geography
The wait is long and heavy too
Despite what you're accustomed to
I know that life moves on, that's what scares me so
Have no intentions of letting go
Only us, no one in the world
Only us, no one in the world

I better do something, move earth and sky
And patiently, sweetly, with all of my might
I sing only for you
To the beat of my footsteps in the night

Close your eyes and dream me home
Forever mine, I'll be forever yours
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore, and on and on
Always, evermore

There's no magic bullet, no cure for pain
What's done is done until you do it again
Life in pursuit of a nameless prey
I've been so close, I'm so far away
It's so hard to explain, so easy to feel
I need you now, nothing is real
Save me from the villains of circumstance
Before I lose my place

Please allow me to introduce myself
I'm a man of wealth and taste
I've been around for a long, long year
Stole many a man's soul and faith
I was 'round when Jesus Christ
Had his moment of doubt and pain
Made damn sure that Pilate
Washed his hands and sealed his fate

Pleased to meet you
Hope you guess my name
But what's puzzlin' you
Is the nature of my game

Stuck around St. Petersburg
When I saw it was a time for a change
Killed the Tsar and his ministers
Anastasia screamed in vain
I rode a tank
Held a general's rank
When the Blitzkrieg raged
And the bodies stank

I shouted out
""Who killed the Kennedys?""

I have to turn my head until my darkness goes

I see a line of cars and they're all painted black
With flowers and my love, both never to come back
I see people turn their heads and quickly look away
Like a newborn baby, it just happens every day

I look inside myself and see my heart is black
I see my red door, I must have it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black

No more will my green sea go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee this thing happening to you
If I look hard enough into the setting sun
My love will laugh with me before the morning comes

Fall is here, hear the yell
Back to school, ring the bell
Brand new shoes, walking blues
Climb the fence, books and pens
I can tell that we are gonna be friends
I can tell that we are gonna be friends

Walk with me, Suzy Lee
Through the park and by the tree
We will rest upon the ground
And look at all the bugs we found
Safely walk to school without a sound
Safely walk to school without a sound

Here we are, no one else
We walk to school all by ourselves
There's dirt on our uniforms
From chasing all the ants and worms
We clean up and now it's time to learn
We clean up and now it's time to learn

Numbers, letters, learn to spell
Nouns and books, and show and tell
Playtime, we will throw the ball
Back to class, through the hall
Teacher marks our height against the wall

But she likes the way you sing

Tonight I'll dream, while I’m in bed
When silly thoughts go through my head
About the bugs and alphabet
And when I wake tomorrow, I'll bet
That you and I will walk together again

We started living in an old house
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out
It was a baby boy, so we bought him a toy
It was a ray gun, and it was 1981

We named him 'Baby', he had a toothache
He started crying, it sounded like an earthquake
It didn't last long, because I stopped it
I grabbed a rag doll and stuck some little pins in it

Now we're a family, and we're alright now
We got money, and a little place to fight now
We don't know you, and we don't owe you
But if you see us around, I got something else to show you


Now it's easy when you don't know better
You think it's sleazy? Then put it in a short letter
We keep warm, but there's just something wrong with you

Grabbed my coat, and I was freaking, I was ready to go
And I swear besides the hair she had one white eye
One blank stare, looking up, lying there

Black rum, sugar cane, dry ice and something strange

When problems overwhelm us and sadness smothers us, where do we find the will and the courage to continue?  Well the answer may come in the caring voice of a friend, a chance encounter with a book, or from a personal faith.  For Janet, help came from her faith, but it also came from a squirrel.  Shortly after her divorce, Janet lost her father then she lost her job, she had mounting money problems.  But Janet not only survived, she worked her way out of despondency and now she says, life is good again.  How could this happen?  She told me that late one autumn day when she was at her lowest she watched a squirrel storing up nuts for the winter, one at a time he would take them to the nest.  And she thought, if that squirrel can take care of himself with a harsh winter coming on, so can I.  Once I broke my problems into small pieces, I was able to carry them, just like those acorns, one at a time

Take all your problems and rip 'em apart
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

Right at home, yeah
Yeah, right at home, yeah

Nobody's got me waitin' in pain
But how come it's so easy to you
You don't strike me as the type to be callous
But your words seem so obtuse
But then again, I know you feel guilty
And you tell me you want me again
But I don't need any of your pity
I got plenty of my own friends, they're all above me

And I been thinkin' about my doorbell
When they're gonna ring it, when they're gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about the doorbell
When they're gonna ring it, and when they're gonna ring it, oh
I been thinkin' about the doorbell
When they're gonna ring it, when they're gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about the doorbell
Oh, well
They don't seem to come around
Push the finger and make a sound
They don't seem to come around
Maybe then they'll knock 'em down
Oh, well

Make a sound and I'll make you feel right
Right at home
Right at home

I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, and when you gonna ring it
I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, when you gonna ring it
I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, a-when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I been thinkin' about my doorbell
And when they're gonna ring it, and when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell
When you gonna ring it, when you gonna ring it
Yeah, I'm thinkin' about my doorbell

I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself

Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do

I just don't know what to do with myself
I don't know what to do with myself

Movies only make me sad
Parties make me feel as bad
'Cause I'm not with you
I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose
Needs the sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away

Well I don't know what to do with myself
Just don't know what to do with myself

Planning everything for two
Doing everything with you
And now that we're through
I just don't know what to do

Like a summer rose
To sun and rain
I need your sweet love
To beat love away

It can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love

Sure I'm C.F.K
But you gotta love me
The cost no man can say
But you gotta love me

Well I'm sorry but I'm not
Interested in gold mines
Oil wells, shipping or real estate
What would I liked to have been?
Everything you hate

It can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love

There is a man
A certain man
And for the poor you may be sure
That he'll do all he can
Who is this one?
Whose favorite son?
Just by his action has the traction
Magnates on the run
Who likes to smoke?
Enjoys a joke?
And wouldn't get a bit
Upset if he were really broke?
With wealth and fame
He's still the same
I'll bet you five you're not alive
If you don't know his name
You might also like
You said, the union forever
You said, the union forever
You cried, the union forever
But that was untrue, girl

'Cause it can't be love
For there is no true love
It can't be love
For there is no true love3Embed",https://images.genius.com/cb37ea69d7344511e6954ed78eaac82b.457x335x2.gif

Hey, little apple blossom
What seems to be the problem?
All the ones you tell your troubles to
They don't really care for you
Come and tell me what you're thinking
'Cause just when the boat is sinking
A little light is blinking
And I will come and rescue you

Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to

Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort 'em out for you

Lots of girls walk around in tears
But that's not for you
You've been looking all around for years
For someone to tell your troubles to
You might also like
Come and sit with me and talk awhile
Let me see your pretty little smile
Put your troubles in a little pile
And I will sort them out for you

I'll fall in love with you
I think I'll marry you10Embed",https://images.genius.com/cb37ea69d7344511e6954ed78eaac82b.457x335x2.gif

You've got her in your pocket
And there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way
To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue
And you'll be there when she finds someone new
What to do?
Well you know

You keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

The smile on your face made her think she had the right one
And she thought she was sure by the way you two could have fun
But now she might leave like she's threatened before
Grab hold of her fast before her feet leave the floor
And she's out the door
'Cause you want
You might also like
To keep her in your pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

And in your own mind, you know you're lucky just to know her
And in the beginning all you wanted was to show her
But now you're scared, you think she's running away
You search in your hand for something clever to say;
""Don't go away""
'Cause I want

To keep you in my pocket
Where there's no way out now
Put it in the safe and lock it
'Cause it's home sweet home

Home sweet home5Embed",https://images.genius.com/cb37ea69d7344511e6954ed78eaac82b.457x335x2.gif
