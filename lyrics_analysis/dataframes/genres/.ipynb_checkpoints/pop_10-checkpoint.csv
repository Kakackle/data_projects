Boy, I've been watching you like the hawk in the sky
That flies, but you were my prey (My prey)
Boy, I promise you if we keep bumpin' heads
I know that one of these days (Days)
We gon' hook it up, prolly talk on the phone
But see, I don't know if that's good
I've been holdin' back this secret from you
I probably shouldn't tell it

But if I, if I let you know
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody
Are you responsible?
Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody
Is it my go, is it your go?
Sometimes I'm goody-goody
Right now I'm naughty-naughty
Say yes or say no, 'cause I really need somebody
Tell me are you that somebody?

Oh boy, see I'm trusting you with my heart, my soul
I probably shouldn't let you

But if I, If I let this go
You can't tell nobody, I'm talkin' 'bout nobody

Boy, I gotta watch my back, 'cause I'm not just anybody

Went from my nigga serving it by the tele to venues in Manchester
Just swerving with Balotelli the fuck are you trying to tell me?
Bothers me when you got to play therapist
That shit's embarrassing
They even bring up these niggas make a comparison
They just got to forgive me, this watch is a 150
Still ain't got the time for a bitch to be acting iffy
Running through the city with niggas I'd give a kidney
Selling under 150 you niggas got to be kidding
Is this even still a discussion?
Don't you ever wake up disgusted
Every million I gain an enemy or a cousin
And people's feelings have changed ever since I became something
Girls that becoming ladies, and my friends are having babies
And babies are dropping dead in my city, this shit is crazy
And I don't know if speaking on it helps
This is shit that's on my mind I just keep it to myself
You know
Can't you talk to me?
Let's talk about it, talk about it
Tell me what you need
Just tell me baby, tell me baby (Yo, what's up?)
Sometimes you are all alone (Need your love, need your love)
But there's no doubt (All the love)
So don't just shut me out
'Cause that's not what love's about
Tell me why

Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah (Yeah)

Haah, haaaah, let me know, let me know

When I feel what I feel
Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
You may not be in the mood
To learn what you think you know
There are times when I'll find
You wanna keep yourself from me
When I don't have the strength
I'm just a mirror of what I see, yeah

But at your best, you are love, yes
You're a positive, motivating force within my life
Should you ever feel the need to wonder why?
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know
Let me, yeah

When you feel what you feel
Oh, how hard for me to understand
So many things have taken place
Before this love affair began
But if you feel, oh, like I feel
Confusion can give way to doubt
For there are times when I fall short of what I say
I'm all about, all about

Ooh, yeah-yeah-yeah
Oh-oh, oh-yeah-yeah

I don't wanna be
Be without you, be without you
I don't wanna live
Live without you, live without you
I don't wanna go
Go without you, go without you
I don't wanna be alone

When we hooked up
We sat down, made an agreement
We vowed that, that we'd always
Be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us
This love would never, ever leave us
That was awhile ago
But now lately it feels like, I mean, I feel like
All we do is fight every single night
Can't make it tight, can't get it right
I just wanna go back and take it way back
All the way back, can we start again?
Do it over, can we straighten it out?
Can we work it out?

Hey, oh
Yeah

How could the one I gave my heart to
Break my heart so bad?
How could the one who made me happy
Make me feel so sad?
Won't somebody tell me, so I can understand
If you love me, how could you hurt me like that?
How could the one I gave my world to
Throw my world away?
How could the one who said, ""I love you""
Say the things you say?
How could the one I was so true to just tell me lies?
How could the one I gave my heart to
Break this heart of mine, tell me

How could you be so cold to me?
When I gave you everything
All my love, all I had inside
How could you just walk out the door?
How could you not love me anymore?
I thought we had forever, I can't understand
How could the one I shared my dreams with
Take my dreams from me?
How could the love that brought such pleasure
Bring such misery?
Won't somebody tell me, somebody tell me please?
If you love me, how could you do that to me, tell me

There we go, okay, okay
Don't do me greasy, okay
Uh, ay-yo, you know what a dog needs?
Do you really know what a dog needs?
A dog needs a bitch (What, what?)
A dog needs a bitch (Come on)
Not just any bitch, but a real bitch
That's gon' hold that dog down

Baby, I am what I am, I'm gon' be who I be
Everything from chasin' a cat to pissin' on a tree
Let me see what I gotta to see, do what I gotta to do
Dog for life, but keep it true
Every once in a while I'll break out the backyard to roam
And get reckless, but I still know that home is home
And when I get there I'ma sit there
Take a shit there, put my dick there
Do I handle my business? Shit, yeah
I'ma run 'til I bust my gun and empty the clip
Then when I come home
And gotta go, just give me the whip
I ain't got time for the lip, just open the fence
Let me go, I'll come back, I ain't got time to convince
Ever since I was a pup, I've been stuck with the street shit
Keep the heat shit, fuck it, nigga gotta eat shit
I pass on a weak shit, if it's out there I want it
All at one time, so when it's my time I've done it
You might also like
I know you'd kill for me, you'd die you for me
I know you like to rip and run the streets
But I get nervous sometimes
Baby, I can't help to think
You might not make it home to eat, I barely sleep
Could you pick up a phone and call me at home?
And let me know you ain't in some heat
And don't go cryin', you're grown
You know I'm lookin' out for you
'Cause you be lookin' out for me, me, me

Yo, you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
So you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
'Fore you go bending the law
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
I know you up in it all, if you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece

And, oh boy, I know you got to do what you do
You're making moves
I'm making moves, yo, we cool
Lay on your paws, I got your back if you fall
Nothing's too big
Nothing's too small, just go ball
Dog tags around my neck, the streets are mine
I might leave the heat behind
‘Cause in the streets I'm fine
That's why a nigga sleep 'til nine, out by ten
Back by ten, sleep 'til nine, do it again
If you love something, let it go
If it comes back to you it yours
If it doesn't, fuck it, you never know
You got me, I got you, dog with a dog
Ride 'till we die, it's on then it's on

Yo, you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me
You make it back in one piece
So you can go with your dogs
If you make this promise to me

How can I explain myself to you?
Questions keep lurking through my mind
Is it the lover for the time?
I've given my heart, my joy, my soul to you
If it is real, I sure can't see
Gotta start lookin' out for me
And in my, my heart won't take no more
I know it seems that I don't care
Sometimes my ways of love ain’t fair
I feel it's time for me to take a stand
See, you have given me no choice
I feel I must exercise my voice and say

This feeling, there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold, I can see your breath, I swear
They told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along

At night, I lay awake in tears and pain (Tears and pain)
Searching my heart for what went wrong (Hey)
Askin' myself ""What's goin' on?""
Why cannot we seem to see things eye to eye? (Eye to eye)
Sometimes I really feel the danger (Hey)
And now I'm sleeping with a stranger
To see all these years, we flushed 'em down the drain (Down the drain)
Is that a love that came for us?
Now, it's too late for both of us
No regrets of what we’ve lost and what we’ve shared
Maybe tomorrow we'll love again (Yeah)
Or until then we'll stay as friends, oh (Hey), one day

And throw on what I wanted then go
Drink beer with the guys
And chase after girls

And I'd never get confronted for it
'Cause they'd stick up for me

If I were a boy
I think I could understand
How it feels to love a girl
I swear I'd be a better man
I'd listen to her
'Cause I know how it hurts
When you lose the one you wanted
'Cause he's taken you for granted
And everything you had got destroyed

If I were a boy
I would turn off my phone
Tell everyone it's broken
So they'd think that I was sleepin' alone
I'd put myself first
And make the rules as I go
'Cause I know that she'd be faithful
Waitin' for me to come home

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

Something don't feel right because it ain't right
Especially comin' up after midnight
I smell your secrets, and I'm not too perfect
To ever feel this worthless
How did it come down to this? Scrolling through your call list
I don't wanna lose my pride, but I'ma fuck me up a bitch
Know that I kept it sexy, you know I kept it fun
There's something that I'm missing, maybe my head for one
What's worst, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous or crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?

Let's imagine for a moment that you never made a name for yourself
Or mastered wealth, they had you labeled as a king
Never made it out the cage, still out there movin' in them streets
Never had the baddest woman in the game up in your sheets
Would they be down to ride? No
They used to hide from you, lie to you
But y'all know we were made for each other
So I find you and hold you down
Me sing se

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?
What a wicked way to treat the girl that loves you
Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you

Hey, this such a shame
You let this good love go to waste
I always keep the top tier, five-star
Backseat lovin' in the car
Like make that wood, like make that wood
Holly like a boulevard
What's worse, lookin' jealous or crazy? Jealous and crazy?
Or like being walked all over lately, walked all over lately
I'd rather be crazy

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Slow down, they don't love you like I love you
Back up, they don't love you like I love you
Step down, they don't love you like I love you
Can't you see there's no other man above you?

Hold up, they don't love you like I love you
Oh, down, they don't love you like I love you

When it's only in my memory, it don't hit me quite the same
Maybe it's a cause for concern, but I'm not at ease
Keeping my head to the curb

Your challengers are a young group from Houston
Welcome Beyoncé, Lativia, Nina, Nicky, Kelly, and Ashley
The hip-hop-rappin' Girls' TYME!
Part I: ""Bow Down""

I'm out that H-Town, comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H-H-Town-Town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of being in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down, bitches (Crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down, bitches
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches (Crown)
Bow down, bitches, bow, bow down, bitches (Crown)

Part II: ***Flawless
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: ""You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man""
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important (C-Candy on the ground)
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support (Dum-da-dee-da)
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage and we don't teach boys the same? (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing (Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground)
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are (Dum-da-de-da)
Feminist: A person who believes in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes (Do-da-da, do-do, do-do-do-da)
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies, tell 'em
Say, ""I look so good tonight""
Goddamn, goddamn
Say, ""I look so good tonight""
Goddamn, goddamn, goddamn
My mama taught me good home-trainin'
My daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man make me feel so goddamn fine, I'm flawless
You wake up (Flawless), post up (Flawless)
Riding 'round in it (Flawless), flossin' on that (Flawless)
This diamond (Flawless), my diamond (Flawless)
This rock (Flawless), my Roc (Flawless)

Open our mind as we cast away oppression (Yeah)
Open the streets and watch our beliefs

Let me sit this ass on you
Show you how I feel
Let me take this off
Will you watch me? (Watch me)
That's mass appeal
Don't take your eyes, don't take your eyes off it
Watch it, babe
If you like, you can touch it, baby
Do you, do you wanna touch it, baby?
Ooh, grab a hold, don't let go
Let me know that you ready (Ready, ready)
I just wanna show you now, slow it down, go around
You rock hard, I rock steady

And rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Rock it 'til water falls
Rock it 'til water falls
Rock it 'til water falls
Bathe in these waterfalls, uh
You might also like
I do it like it's my profession
I gotta make a confession
I'm proud of all this bass
Baby, I'll put it in your face
By the way, if you need a personal trainer or a therapist
I can be a piece of sunshine, inner peace, entertainer
Anything else that you may read between the lines
You and I create rockets and waterfalls

So rock right up to the side of my mountain
Climb until you reach my peak, baby, peak, baby, peak
And reach right into the bottom of my fountain
I wanna play in your deep, baby, deep, baby, deep
Then dip me under where you can feel my river flow and flow
Hold me 'til I scream for air to breathe
And wash me over until my well runs dry
Send all your sins all over me, baby, me, baby, me

Hard, rock, steady, rock
Hard, rock, steady, rock
Hard, rock, steady, rock
Hard, rock, steady
Don't you know that I give you good lovin' if you need it?
I'll give you my word, you can believe it
Your love feels like all four seasons growing inside me
Life has a reason
Swimming in my love (Your love), your love lifting
Higher, harder
Got me screamin' to the Lord, boy
Kiss me, pray we don't overflow
Baby, I know you can feel it pulse
Deep in the peak of my waterfall
Rock it, baby, rock it, baby, rock it 'til the water falls
Damn

I can't help but love the way we make love
Daddy, daddy
Ooh, child, ooh, now
Yes, Lord, damn, baby
You drivin' me cray, cray
You ain't right for doin' it to me like that, daddy
Even though I've been a bad, bad, bad
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad girl
Tell me what you're gon' do about that
Punish me, please
Punish me, please
Daddy, what you gon' do with all this ass
All up in your face? Yeah
Hell, yeah (Love me so deep)
Ooh, my shit's so good, it ain't even right
I know I'm right
Hell, yeah, you the shit
That's why you're my equivalent
So sexy
We're so much more than pointless fixtures
Instagram pictures, consumers
Wanna rock that ching-ching-ching
Wanna rock that, wanna rock that ching-ching
Baby boomers (Baby, baby, baby, baby)
Cyclical trends, tryna fit in
Home is where the heart is
Goddammit, I'm comfortable in my skin

Listen
To the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But can't complete
Listen
To the sound from deep within
It's only beginning
To find release

Oh, the time has come for my dreams to be heard
They will not be pushed aside and turned
Into your own, all 'cause you won't listen

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

Someone I thought had died

Oh, I'm screamin' out and my dreams will be heard
They will not be pushed aside or worked

Listen, I am alone at a crossroads
I'm not at home in my own home
And I've tried and tried to say what's on my mind
You should have known, oh
Now I'm done believin' you
You don't know what I'm feelin'
I'm more than what you made of me
I followed the voice you gave to me
But now I've gotta find my own

I don't know where I belong
But I'll be moving on
If you don't
If you won't
Listen to the song here in my heart
A melody I start
But I will complete, oh-oh

But nine times out of ten, I know you're trying

And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
And all the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware

You're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me?
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day? Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough, mmm

'Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought

But ten times out of nine, I'm only human

Notice me
Take my hand
Why are we
Strangers when

Our love is strong?
Why carry on without me?

Every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you, baby

I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear

What have I done?
You seem to move on easy

I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain
And this song's my sorry

Ooh

At night, I pray
That soon your face will fade away

And every time I try to fly, I fall
Without my wings, I feel so small
I guess I need you, baby
And every time I see you in my dreams

This is a story about a girl named Lucky

Early morning, she wakes up
Knock, knock, knock on the door
It's time for makeup, perfect smile
It's you they're all waiting for

They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""
And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star""
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
""If there's nothing missing in my life
Then why do these tears come at night?""

Lost in an image, in a dream
But there's no one there to wake her up
And the world is spinning, and she keeps on winning
But tell me, what happens when it stops?

They go, ""Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?""

""I'm Roger Johnson for Pop News, standing outside the arena waiting for Lucky""
""Oh my God, here she comes!""

Isn't she lovely, this Hollywood girl?
She is so lucky, but why does she cry?
If there is nothing missing in her life
Why do tears come at night?
And they say

""She's so lucky, she's a star""
But she cry, cry, cries in her lonely heart, thinking
""If there's nothing missing in my life

I'm dreaming a mile a minute 'bout somebody

We're hiding away from this tonight, oh, this tonight
Can tell you want me
By the way I see you starin' 'cross the room, babe
No shame in the game, just cut the shit, be honest
Yeah, you know what you gotta do tonight, do tonight

I just want you to make me move
Like it ain't a choice for you, like you've got a job to do
Just want you to raise my roof
Something sensational (Sensational, oh, yeah)

And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

No rules
From the bar to the car, let's take it back to my room
Ignite in the heat of the moment, let the sparks fuse
Blowing up to the ceiling, we burning bright when we cut the light
'Cause you're the flame I can't do without
The fire comes in, the sky falls down
There's no way I'm gonna be fighting this tonight, this tonight

My heart's on fire when you're around
Make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, Eazy

I don't care if it's a random person or the biggest star
Out in Vegas or a little bar
It’s really not a difference if it's near or far
Listen, here we are, need you
I've always wanted what was off limits
Staring at you 'til I'm caught in this
Back and forth like this is all tennis
I'm all jealous, you came with someone
But we can tell that there are changes coming
See, I can tell that you're a dangerous woman
That means you're speaking my language, come on
Now follow me, let's go (Go)
Like Penelope in Blow
Well aware that stealing you is a felony, yeah I know
That's why they keep on telling me to let go, yeah
But I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
To give you something sensational, so let's go, yeah
Said I need you and I can take you
All the way and I'm able
So follow me and I can make you

And make me ooh (Move), ooh, ooh (Yeah), ooh
And make me ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Baby, 'cause you're the spark that won't go out
My heart's on fire when you're around

I know I may be young, but I’ve got feelings too
And I need to do what I feel like doing
So let me go and just listen

All you people look at me like I’m a little girl
Well, did you ever think it'd be okay for me to step into this world?
Always saying, ""Little girl, don’t step into the club""
Well, I’m just tryna find out why, 'cause dancing’s what I love, yeah (Now watch me)

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, whoa (Do you like it?)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
(This feels good)

I know I may come off quiet, I may come off shy
But I feel like talking, feel like dancing when I see this guy
What’s practical? What's logical? What the hell, who cares?
All I know is I’m so happy when you’re dancing there

I’m a slave for you
I cannot hold it, I cannot control it
I’m a slave for you
I won’t deny it, I’m not tryna hide it
You might also like
Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)

Like that
You like it?
Yeah
Now watch me

Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh
Get it, get it, get it, get it, whoa (Do you like it?)
Get it, get it, get it, get it, oh

I really wanna dance tonight with you (I just can’t help myself)
I really wanna do what you want me to (I just feel I let myself go)
I really wanna dance tonight with you (I wanna see you move)
I really wanna do what you want me to (Uh, uh, uh)

Baby, don’t you wanna dance up on me? (I just wanna dance next to you)

Treat you right
Be with you day and night

Only fools could ever feel this way
Send my message into outer space
Wonder if it's gonna float your way

I can't compete with the stars in the sky
I'm invisible, invisible
I open the window to clear out my mind
But it's difficult, so difficult

Houston, I know there's a problem here
Must be a hole in the atmosphere
Baby, I wanna be closer to love

Patience, darling, wait for the night
Darkness comes and love comes alive
I've been right here dreaming of you
Waiting for my man on the moon
Moon

Last night I was in your arms so strong (It felt so good)
One small step and, baby, you were gone
Now there's meaning in the saddest songs (I just wanna cry)
All I do is cry and sing along (And cry, and cry...)

Wonder, wonder how I do
How's the weather? Am I better?
Better now that there's no you?
Drink tequila for me, babe
Let it hit you cold and hot
Let your feelings be revealing that you can't forget me

Not a flower on the wall
I am growing ten feet, ten feet tall
In your head and I won't stop
Until you forget me, get me not

In your fantasy, dream about me
And all that we could do with this emotion

And all that we could do with this emotion
This emotion, I feel it

Paint a picture for me, boy

Boy number one made a picnic for two
Saw he was nervous, I thought it was cute
Until I found out that his mom made the food
It was good though
Boy number two had a beautiful face
I highly agreed to go back to his place
His wife really had some impeccable taste
She was sweet though

This roller coaster's a carousel
And I'm getting nowhere

Boys around the world, I want to believe that

And I'm probably gonna hurt your feelings""

You and me
We've been hanging around for the longest time
I know when you're down (Down)
Know what you need to get you high
Top down (Top down)
Let the wind through your hair on a summer's night
Outside
All of your fears, leaving them behind

Here I come now
Baby, I'm speeding and red lights, I'll run
What I got, you need it
And I'll run to your side when your heart is bleeding
I'm coming to getcha, to getcha, to getcha, oh

I know you've had a rough time
But here I come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while
Making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come, I'mma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while
We're making the most of the night
I know you've had a rough time
But here I come to hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while

But here I come, I'mma hijack you, hijack you
I'll love you while
We're making the most of the night

Your eyes wide
Like you never seen the ocean, never seen the tides (Tides)
No hope
Now you're seeing things that you'd lost sight of
Taking off
Got your hands in the air, and you're feeling alright
Gold mines glisten on the skin for you and I

Here I come now
Baby, I'm speeding and red lights, I'll run
What I got, you need it
And I'll run to your side when your heart is bleeding
I'm coming to getcha, to getcha, to getcha, oh

Never cared about the fake kids

Used to stay up all night, he and I

The milkman, the paperboy, the evening tv?
How did I get delivered here? Somebody tell me, please
'Cause this old world is just really confusing me

Clouds as mean as you've ever seen
Ain't a bird that knows your tune
Then a little voice inside of you whispers
""Kid, don't sell your dreams so soon!""

Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a heart (there's a heart), a hand to hold onto
Everywhere you look, everywhere you go
There's a face (there's a face) of somebody who needs you

Whatever happened to the good old days?
Talking to friends for hours, swore it'd never go away
Now I'm feeling a little crazy, trying to fit in with a scene
Cause how do you know where you're going, if you really don't know who you've been?

Love suicide
You and I drove for miles
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you
We took a dive in the blue, scared to lose
All my feelings, feelings, feelings for you
Knew I'd be here, be here, be here with you

Yeah, now we gotta let this go
Drove the car off the road
I gotta give you time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head
I didn't wanna leave you low
Drove the car off the road
I hope you get some time to grow
You're not a ghost, you're in my head (In my head...)

Even when we're not together
I will always love you (Love you)

Told 'em paddle, paddle, paddle 'cause this pussy in Seattle

'Bout to turn your mansion to the pussy palace
And shake it on ya like my ass on the Richter scale
My pussy crucify your body, it's the holy grail
My pussy lean, I got you sippin' from the two cup
I'm 'bout to shake my ass like I'm in a strip club
Hey, my ass is Magic City

Shake it like a box-fresh vibrator

Know I keep on saying I'm alright
But every single night
When I cut off the lights
I feel like crying
Your picture revolving in my mind
But then it turns to white
I guess I’ll go in blind
I feel like crying
Hope you can forgive all of my crimes
You read, but won't reply
I just need your reply
I feel like crying
Baby, all I need's a single night
A sign, a sign, give me a sign

Sorry I broke you down
Sorry I tore your heart
I ripped it all apart
Your headlights in the dark
Sorry ’bout Grammy night
Was flyin' out my mind
Was in a different place
Tortured and drifting by
Kept dancing in that house
The windows turned to black
My windows turned to black
My eyes were rolling back, yeah
Hope I get one more chance
Hope I get one more call

Don't say you love me 'cause I can't say it back
Don't say you're sorry 'cause you've done nothing bad
Swallow my feelings, but won't swallow my pride
You know I've got a suit of armor on, you'll never see me cry
I hate the silence (Ah-ah), that's why the music's always loud
So many problems (Ah-ah), I try to drown 'em out
1000 bottles (Ah-ah), collecting souvenirs
You know it's so hard to admit it
But the only good inside of me is you

I take all of these blue and yellow pills
But nothing seems to last like you
You're chasing after something that you'll never catch
Woah

Like a white Mercedes, always been running too fast
When your heart is breaking, you keep on taking me back
Hate myself, I really love you
Hurting you feels like I'm hurting as well
All I know is I don't deserve you

You're so forgiving (Ah-ah), my friends think you're the best
From the beginning (Ah-ah), your friends said it wouldn't last
But this connection (Ah-ah), it's something they don't see
You know it's so hard to admit it

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
(Too many times, too many times)

My love
He makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love
He doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the mornin'
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself

If you don't wanna see me

Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up

I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me

Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now

Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word ""goodbye""?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong

So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck

I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position

It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, ""Hello""
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

We created something phenomenal

You got me feeling diamond rich
Nothing on this planet compares to it
Don't you agree?

Who needs to go to sleep when I got you next to me?

All night, I'll riot with you
I know you got my back and you know I got you
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on (Come on)
Let's get physical
Lights out, follow the noise
Baby, keep on dancing like you ain't got a choice
So come on (Come on), come on (Come on), come on

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge

I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good

We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine

Fighting for you
When the rain stops, then, darling, what will I do?
And I know I go all in, but why do I?

You give me a reason, something to believe in

You give me a meaning, something I can breathe in

Oh, I wish I was there with you

It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? (Ah)
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now (Ah)

When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright

Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop

Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey

Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe

Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby

Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman

Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me

Some boys kiss me, some boys hug me
I think they're okay
If they don't give me proper credit, I just walk away
They can beg and they can plead
But they can't see the light (That's right)
'Cause the boy with the cold hard cash is always Mister Right

'Cause we are living in a material world
And I am a material girl
You know that we are living in a material world

Some boys romance, some boys slow dance
That's all right with me
If they can't raise my interest, then I have to let them be
Some boys try and some boys lie
But I don't let them play (No way)
Only boys that save their pennies make my rainy day

¿Cómo puede ser verdad?

Last night I dreamt of San Pedro
Just like I'd never gone, I knew the song
Young girl with eyes like the desert
It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
Ring through my ears and sting my eyes, your Spanish lullaby

I fell in love with San Pedro
Warm wind carried on the sea, he called to me
Te dijo, ""Te amo""
I prayed that the days would last, they went so fast

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)
This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita
And when the samba played, the sun would set so high
(Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah)

It all seems like yesterday, not far away

Tropical the island breeze, all of nature wild and free

This is where I long to be, La Isla Bonita

Get up on your feet

Music can be such a revelation
Dancing around, you feel the sweet sensation
We might be lovers if the rhythm's right
I hope this feeling never ends tonight

Only when I'm dancing can I feel this free
At night, I lock the doors, where no one else can see
I'm tired of dancing here all by myself
Tonight, I want to dance with someone else

Do you believe in love?
'Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real

You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not in bed?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
(Baby, on your own)

Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey

What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you 'til you can't come down

And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had

And I'm not afraid at all to die 'cause I believe Him
God is on my side and I'll be His bride
I am not afraid 'cause I have faith in Him

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, ""Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?""
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

People always told me, ""Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts"" (Hee-hee)
And mother always told me, ""Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do (Oh-oh)
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"" (Oh-oh), hey-ey

Billie Jean is not my lover, uh
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hoo)
She says I am the one (Oh, baby)
But the kid is not my son (Hee-hee-hee, no-no, hee-hee-hee, hoo)

For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand? Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round (Hee)
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice) Do think twice! (A-hoo!)
She told my baby we'd danced 'til three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin', his eyes were like mine (Oh, no)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby (Ooh, hee-hee-hee)

This happened much too soon (Ha-oh, ha-ooh)
She called me to her room (Ha-oh, hoo), hey-ey

It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs?
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na, na-na

I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be

Why?

Looking out across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite

If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
If they say why (Why?), why (Why?)
Tell them that it's human nature
Why (Why?), why (Why?), does he do me that way?
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching

Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder

Aouw! (Ooh)

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same

Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white, ooh!

They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell 'em
""I ain't second to none""

And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right, hee!

Oh, when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Protection for gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye (Hee-hee!)
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white

But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me

Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want

She's touching me so to start
She says ""There's no turning back""

Think about, um, the generations and, uh, say we wanna make it a better place for our children and our children's children, so that they, they, they s—they know it's a better world for them, and think if they can make it a better place...

There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow

There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
You might also like
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
Make a better world
So make a better world

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me

And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this Earth, crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see this world is heavenly
Be God's glow

We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place

Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world (Heal the world)
Make it a better place (Better place)
For you and for me and the entire human race (Oh, no)
There are people dying (Oh)

Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be that you're not here with me?
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold?

Every day, I sit and ask myself ""How did love slip away?""
Somethin' whispers in my ear and says

That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens, I will bear
But first, I need your hand, then forever can begin

Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
For you are not alone, oh-oh-oh

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin', fly
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there

But you are not alone, I am here with you

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?

Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me

Do you remember the time?

Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

Do you remember the time?

When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?

Will always be dear to me

Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity

'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
You're so convincing
How do you lie without flinching?
(How do you lie? How do you lie? How do you lie?)
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better

As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bloodsucker, fame fucker
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
(Ah)
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand

I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night

But you made me look so naive

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies

One, two, three
Wait, is this the song with the drums?

I met a guy in the summer, and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's six-foot-two, and I'm like, ""Dude, nice try""
But he was so much fun, and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties, and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back

So I write him all these letters, and I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting ""send""
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him

I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him, and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge, and I want him again
I want to get him back (And then? And then)
I want to get him back, back, back

I wanna key his car (I want to get him back)

Then be the one to stitch it up (But then I, I want to get him back; yeah)
Wanna kiss his face (But then I, I want to get him back)
With an uppercut (But then I, I want to get him back)
I wanna meet his mom (But then I, I want to get him back)
Just to tell her her son sucks (But then I, I want to get him back)

I have nightmares each week 'bout that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold onto every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough

And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car, and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone, and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fuckin' sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal

It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong

Ooh, do you think I deserved it all?
Ooh, your flowers filled with vitriol
You built me up to watch me fall
You have everything, and you still want more

I try to be tough, I try to be mean
But even after all this, you're still everything to me
And I know you don't care, I guess that that's fine

Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

Cat got my tongue
And I don't think I get along with anyone
Blood runnin' cold
I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke
And I hate all my clothes
Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones
So I guess I should go
The party's done, and I'm no fun, I know, I know
I know, I know

I broke a glass, I tripped and fell
I told secrets I shouldn't tell
I stumbled over all my words
I made it weird, I made it worse
Each time I step outside, it's social suicide
It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide

Ah, ah, ah

I laughed at the wrong time, sat with the wrong guy (Uh-huh)
Sеarchin' ""how to start a conversation?"" on a website (How to flirt?)
I talkеd to this hot guy, swore I was his type
Guess that he was makin' out with boys, like, the whole night (Oh)
Everythin' I do is tragic (Oh)
Every guy I like is gay (Oh)
The morning after I panic (Oh)
Oh, God, what did I say? (Oh, oh, oh)

It's social suicide, yeah, when I'm alone, I'm fine
But don't let me out at night, it's social suicide

Ah, ah, ah

I broke a glass, tripped and fell
Told secrets I shouldn't tell
Stumbled over all my words
Made it weird, then made it worse
Each day that I'm alive, it's social suicide
It's social suicide, wanna curl up and die
It's social suicide
It's social suicide, don't let me out at night

Want it, so I got it, did it, so it's done
Another thing I ruined I used to do for fun
Another piece of plastic I could just throw away
Another conversation with nothing good to say
I thought it, so I said it, took it 'cause I can
Another day pretendin' I'm older than I am
Another perfect moment that doesn't feel like mine
Another thing I forced to be a sign

Well, sometimes I feel like I don't wanna be where I am
Gettin' drunk at a club with my fair-weather friends
Push away all the people who know me the best
But it's me who's been makin' the bed
I'm so tired of bein' the girl that I am
Every good thing has turned into somethin' I dread
And I'm playin' the victim so well in my head
But it's me who's been makin' the bed

Me who's been makin' the bed
Pull the sheets over my head, yeah
Makin' the bed

And every night, I wake up from this one recurrin' dream
Where I'm drivin' through the city and the brakes go out on me
I can't stop at the red light, I can't swerve off the road
I read somewhere it's 'cause my life feels so out of control
And I tell someone I love them just as a distraction
They tell me that they love me like I'm some tourist attraction
They're changin' my machinery, and I just let it happen
I got the things I wanted, it's just not what I imagined

And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you

God, you're so good at what you do
Come for me like a savior
And I'd put myself through hell for you
Hear all the rumors lately
That you always denied
And I fell for you like water
Falls from the February sky
But now the current's stronger
No, I couldn't get out if I tried
But you convinced me, baby
It was all in my mind

And now you got me thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changing you is possible
No, love is never logical

You built a giant castle
With walls so high I couldn't see
The way it all unraveled
And all the things you did to me
You lied, you lied, you lied, oh

And you mean all those words you said
I'm sure that girl is really your friend
Our problems are all solvable
'Cause loving you is loving every

Argument you held over my head
Brought up the girls you could have instead
Said I was too young, I was too soft
Can't take a joke, can't get you off
Oh, why do I do this?

I look so stupid thinkin'
Two plus two equals five
And I'm the love of your life
'Cause if rain don't pour and sun don't shine
Then changing you is possible (Ah, ah)
No, love is never logical
Logical, logical

I know I'm half responsible
And that makes me feel horrible
Oh, logical, logical

I know I could've stopped it all

I knew a boy once when I was small
A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching band
His parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad
And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there, I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on hеr own
Her parents hated who shе loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood
Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you and I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing is as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)

Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
You might also like
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed

Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
(Ooh)

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
You might also like
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

(Taylor’s Version)  Lyrics
(Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it? Is it?)

Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

(Is it? Is it? Is it?)

Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone
You might also like
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)
You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passed out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it? Is it?)
Uh-huh
(Is it? Is it?)
Think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs
Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no

(Flashin' lights; Oh, Lord; Oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing (Oh, Lord)
I've been wanting (Oh, Lord)

Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
You might also like
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

Or lead me to the garden?

If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said, ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine

We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason

And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls

Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will

Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow

Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me

Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick
You might also like
And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
And you know what they all say
""You don't know what you got until it's gone""

Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me
'Cause you're losin' me
Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me

My heart won't start anymore
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)
My heart won't start anymore
(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)

How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fadin', thinkin'
""Do something, babe, say something"" (Say something)
""Lose something, babe, risk something"" (You're losin' me)
""Choose something, babe, I got nothing"" (I got nothing)
""To believe, unless you're choosin' me""
You're losin' me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore16Embed",https://images.genius.com/e57a74fef86ec2fd253a09f08d6f26e2.400x400x1.jpg

I sit and watch you readin' with your head low
I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listеn
I polish plates until they gleam and glistеn
You're so much older and wiser, and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawin' hearts in the byline
Always takin' up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)

Break free and leave us in ruins?
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I sit and watch you83Embed",https://images.genius.com/e57a74fef86ec2fd253a09f08d6f26e2.400x400x1.jpg

We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet90Embed",https://images.genius.com/e57a74fef86ec2fd253a09f08d6f26e2.400x400x1.jpg

I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Woah, woah)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones too

You so dope, don't overdose, I’m so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat
I got a reputation, girl, that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life
You might also like
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just another ex-love (You don’t wanna see)
I don’t wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don’t wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on the beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumours, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it’s easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, somethin' was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just another ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on the beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (Yeah)
But I ain't tryna play (Ooh)

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Hey)
Big reputation, big reputation (Big reputation, yeah)
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your handprints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been callin' my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips (Ooh, ah)

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you; First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Hey; Be your A-Team now; A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do; End game)

You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night
You might also like
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?

Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now
