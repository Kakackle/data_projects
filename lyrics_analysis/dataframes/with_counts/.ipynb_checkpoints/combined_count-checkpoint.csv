school with this music 'cause i use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme"" now i lead a new school full of students me i'm a product of rakim lakim shabazz 2pac nwa cube hey doc ren yella eazy thank you they got slim inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position to meet run–dmc and induct them into the motherfuckin' rock and roll hall of fame even though i'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames only hall of fame i'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame on the wall of shame you fags think it's all a game 'til i walk a flock of flames off a plank and tell me what in

earnhardt of the trailer park the white trash god kneel before general zod this planet's krypton—no asgard asgard  so you'll be thor and i'll be odin you rodent i'm omnipotent let off then i'm reloadin' immediately with these bombs i'm totin' and i should not be woken i'm the walkin' dead but i'm just a talkin' head a zombie floatin' but i got your mom deepthroatin' i'm out my ramen noodle we have nothin' in common poodle i'm a doberman pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil it's me my honesty's brutal but it's honestly futile if i don't utilize what i do though for good at least once in a while so i wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch i scribble and doodle enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times but i gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime i know there was a time where once i was king of the underground but i still rap like i'm on my pharoahe monch grind so i crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine appeal with the skin color of mine you get too big and here they come tryin' to censor you like that one line i said on ""i'm back"" from the mathers lp 1 when i tried to say i'll take seven kids from columbine put 'em all in a line add an ak47 a revolver and a 9 see if i get away with it now that i ain't as big as i was but i'm morphin' into an immortal comin' through the portal you're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though and i don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for you're pointless as rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows you write normal fuck being normal and i just bought a new raygun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when fabolous made ray j mad 'cause fab said he looked like a fag at mayweather's pad singin' to a man while he played piano man oh man that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel so ray j went straight to the radio station the very next day ""hey fab i'ma kill you"" lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed jj fad uh summalumma doomalumma you assumin' i'm a human what i gotta do to get it through to you i'm superhuman innovative and i'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and i'm devastating more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating never fading and i know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say i fell off they'll be celebrating 'cause i know the way to get 'em motivated i make elevating music you make elevator music ""oh he's too mainstream"" well that's what they do when they get jealous they confuse it ""it's not hiphop it's pop""—'cause i found a hella way to fuse it with rock shock rap with doc throw on ""lose yourself"" and make 'em lose it ""i don't know how to make songs like that i don't know what words to use"" let me know when it occurs to you while i'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you it's curtains i'm inadvertently hurtin' you how many verses i gotta murder to prove that if you were half as nice your songs you could sacrifice virgins too ugh school flunky pill junkie but look at the accolades these skills brung me full of myself but still hungry i bully myself 'cause i make me do what i put my mind to and i'm a million leagues above you ill when i speak in tongues but it's still tongueincheek fuck you i'm drunk so satan take the fucking wheel i'ma sleep in the front seat bumpin' heavy d and the boyz still ""chunky but funky"" but in my head there's something i can feel tugging and struggling angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me they're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred i have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination but fuck it life's handin' you lemons make lemonade then but if i can't batter the women how the fuck am i supposed to bake 'em a cake then don't mistake him for satan it's a fatal mistake if you think i need to be overseas and take a vacation to trip a broad and make her fall on her face and don't be a retard—be a king think not why be a king when you can be a god68k",https://images.genius.com/37f958ab28031af87d13b5d224749878.533x533x1.jpg,636,1,1,12,0,154,3,0,1,38,male,rap

know what a woman's clitoris is of course they're gonna know what intercourse is by the time they hit fourth grade they've got the discovery channel don't they we ain't nothin' but mammals well some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes but if we can hump dead animals and antelopes then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope but if you feel like i feel i got

tried to serve you up a slider maybe the vocals shoulda been autotuned and you woulda bought it but sayin' i no longer got it 'cause you missed a line and never caught it 'cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it 'cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest with your expertise and knowledge but you'll never be an artist and i'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless what i'll never be is flawless all i'll ever be is honest illa illa illa even when i'm gone they're gonna say i brought it even when i hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic with a bottle full of malt liquor but i couldn't bottle this shit any longer the fact that i know that i'ma hit my bottom if i don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet i don't see why y'all even started with me i get in beefs my enemies die i don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased i'm east side never be caught slippin' now you see why i don't sleep not even a wink i

beast of burden that line in the sand was it even worth it 'cause the way i see people turning's makin' it seem worthless it's startin' to defeat the purpose i'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds and i was just tryin' to do the right thing but word has the court of public opinion reached a verdict or still yet to be determined 'cause i'm determined to be me critiqued or worshipped but if i could go back i'd at least reword it and say i empathize with the people this evil serpent sold the dream to that he's deserted but i think it's workin' these verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous and he's too scurred to answer me with words 'cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered but i know at least he's heard it 'cause agent orange just sent the secret service to meet in person to see if i really think of hurtin' him or ask if i'm linked to terrorists i said ""only when it comes to ink and lyricists"" but my beef is more media journalists hold up hold up hold up i said my beef is more meaty a journalist can get a mouthful of flesh and yes i mean eating a penis 'cause they've been pannin' my album to death so i've been givin' the media fingers don't wanna turn this to a

come soon and if i'm doomed may the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons i suffer a lot and every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch i tie my stomach in knots and i'm not sure why i'm infatuated with death my imagination is surely an aggravation of threats that can come about 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful and i can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch maybe 'cause i'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when i'ma rest and you're right your brother was a brother to me and your sister's situation was the one that pulled me in a direction to speak on somethin' that's realer than the tv screen by any means wasn't tryin' to offend or come between her personal life i was like ""it need to be told"" cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul exactly what'd happen if i ain't continue rappin' or steady bein' distracted by money drugs and 45's i count lives all on these songs look at the weak and cry pray one day you'll be strong fightin' for your rights even when you're wrong and hope that at least one of you sing about me when i'm gone am i worth it did i put enough work in promise that you
