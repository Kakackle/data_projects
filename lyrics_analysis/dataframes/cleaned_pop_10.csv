version taylor’s version  lyrics i walked through the door with you the air was cold but somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister's house and you've still got it in your drawer even now  oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze we're singin' in the car getting lost upstate autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days  and i know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more and i might be okay but i'm not fine at all oh oh oh  'causе there we arе again on that little town street you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well  photo album on the counter your cheeks were turnin' red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twinsized bed and your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the teeball team you taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me and you were tossing me the car keys ""fuck the patriarchy"" keychain on the ground we were always skippin' town and i was thinkin' on the drive down ""any time now he's gonna say it's love"" you never called it what it was 'til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same after three months in the grave and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame you might also like and i know it's long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to  'cause there we are again in the middle of the night we're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well and there we are again when nobody had to know you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath sacred prayer and we'd swear to remember it all too well yeah  well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up runnin' scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of bein' honest i'm a crumpledup piece of paper lyin' here 'cause i remember it all all all they say all's well that ends well but i'm in a new hell every time you doublecross my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would've been fine and that made me want to die the idea you had of me who was she a neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not weepin' in a party bathroom some actress askin' me what happened you that's what happened you you who charmed my dad with selfeffacing jokes sippin' coffee like you're on a latenight show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willin' you to come and he said ""it's supposed to be fun turning twentyone""  time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still tryin' to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah  'cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well and i was never good at tellin' jokes but the punch line goes ""i'll get older but your lovers stay my age"" from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue just between us did the love affair maim you too 'cause in this city's barren cold i still remember the first fall of snow and how it glistened as it fell i remember it all too well  just between us did the love affair maim you all too well just between us do you remember it all too well just between us i remember it just between us all too well wind in my hair i was there i was there i was there down the stairs i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it all too well wind in my hair i was there i was there oh down the stairs i was there i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it all too well wind in my hair i was there i was there down the stairs i was there i was there sacred prayer i was
