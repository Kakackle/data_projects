Colder than them grits they fed slaves
Me to rap is like water to raves
AKs with bayonets on deck, rep my set
Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth, but she fantasizing
Staring at the skinnies, said it's so tantalizing
Dog, I'm strategizing, plotting on the throne
Master of the ace, sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep, stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger, so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
And I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
Try to escape it, hoping the drugs'll numb my soul
Say I'm getting old, time's running out
Repeating instrumentals, tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house, ain't slept in three days
Poppin' pills, writin', drinkin' and smokin' haze
Weavin' kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original, something that's overlooked
The way a nigga goin', might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up, callin' home for money on my books
'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it, so these pills'll be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now, so let that blunt burn
'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up
It took a while to get here, now I depend on these drugs, uh
I took a while to get here, now I depend on these drugs

You niggas don’t even know
All that talk then no show
Cannot tell me nothin'
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it
While we chop chop on them 24s
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4
Now a nigga livin' good
I done made it out the hood
Think I'm goin' back?
I wish a motherfucker would

Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch
To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good
But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire

Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what we're enduring
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns
Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire

Good, hood
I wish you motherfuckin' would
Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown
I had to put my foot down
It's like I'm popping a clutch
Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust
You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight
Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
You've been the same motherfucker since 2001
Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump
I'm at your house like, ""Why you got your couch on my Chucks?""

Remember when my first meal was school lunch
Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then, man we thought we growed up
Rushin' out of kid just to be grown up

Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Yeah, whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills, got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man, they wetter than the Everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch
Niggas catch a heart attack
Newport soft pack never blow blunt wraps
But these blunt raps sewn up
Whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

Verbal couture, parkour with the metaphors
The flow house of horror, dead bolted with metal doors
Grinch bitch, six sense with a nose drip
Mind skydive, sniffing bumps in the cockpit
Locksmith of hip-hop, appraisal the wrist watch
The rocks bout the size as the teeth in Chris Rock's mouth
Sock out the mic, prototype for Adderall
Your work killing fiends 'cause you cut it with Fentanyl
So much coke just to sniff, need a ski lift
Flip your table over if you cut it with the bullshit
Nosebleed on red carpets, but it just blend in
Snapping pictures feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life, seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left so I try to seize the moment

Funny how it happens who ever would imagine
That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?

Nose running right now, could ya pass me a napkin?
Managed to somehow to have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone and nobody is answering
Ain't it funny how it happens?

No way to mask it, a lot became has beens
Rolling up that hundred dollar bill till they cash in
Thinks it gone last, going too fast

Ain't it funny how it happens? Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down 'cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
It's a living nightmare, that most of us might share
Inherited in our blood, it's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to, tell you what I'm gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems with this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me so I'm popping them Xannies
Might need rehab but to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y'all 'cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8-ball of coke and my nigga on the way
Got three hoes with him and they all tryna play
Funny how it happens who ever would imagine

Ain't gonna be too many suckers, and furthermore, I think you better check your mitts
Jay, come on, baby, let's cut this place loose
Yeah, chump, you better get the fuck out of here
And take your bitches with you, especially Ug-Mug here

The Hybrid, smoking on papaya
That give you niggas bronchitis, what you write is all vagina
What I write is Wall of China, nigga, that's great
Like eighths of Grape Apes gettin' stuffed in my suitcase
Ready to hit the studio and shit all on your mixtape
Nah, literally, shit all on your mixtape
Wipe with the credits, leave stains on the jewel case
In just two takes, dog, the booth'll get souffléd
You're hiding something like a toupée
Truthfully, my friend, touché
You gon' get exposed like an up-and-coming model
And to me, your label seems like one of them pageant mamas
So guess who's the little bitch? That's you
You must suck a lot of dick, that's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like Bristol, heart of igloos
My nigga, you ain't been what I been through
And if so, you would take a pencil through your temple
'Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even had pads, stuffed they panties with tissue
Hit the ave 'cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And your style's like fried chicken without seasoning
Nigga, that's bland, fuck you up and your mans
I smack you like a bitch, nigga, that's open-hand
Fuck you and your tough talk
When I monopolize, I throw your ass off the boardwalk
Fag, you ain't play sports, but always at the ballpark
Type of nigga rocking Crocs at the fuckin' Walmart
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in a fiend car
Get flicked, guess what? I'm runnin' from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got the hammer
But this kush got me high like Pac bandanna

That's why these white bitches wanna get with him
I smack it, flip it like Mike Bivins
But to me, your flow's like Ronny DeVoe's
My hoes got toes in expensive high heels
Your hoes' toes is fucked, beauty supply sandals

25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas

Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
'Bout to feed her kids at night, sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldies, soap operas, smoking bogies
On the phone, gossiping, telling homegirls stories
Girlfriend worried 'cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied, do her best, but it's still rough
Keep your kids off the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house, ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out: ""Ayy, who turned that channel?""
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, laughing, tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going

If you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food
If you really wonder why these people got issues
'Cause the rent owed and the fucking lights due
On her knees at night, pray a miracle come through
Daddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes
I been growing my hair, 'bout to let mommy twist it
Out wilding with my friends, even got myself a biscuit
Homie momma smoking with nothing to lose
Now he stashing cracks in some hundred-dollar shoes
Sitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded
Told me hit my mommy up, 'cause he tryna get braided
What we gon' do? See the local dopeman
See if he can put some money in our hand
Same one jump me, the same one front me

Brown bless the mic like gesundheit

Kick it like Muay Thai, flow like sci-fi in high def
I'm righteous and still bust a nut up on a bitch chest
The verbal folklore been explored
And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch in my target when I shoot my load
Bullseye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke somethin' with your man, bitch
Like Wyclef, used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript, sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffin' Adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Trippin' off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much, it's a miracle I'm livin'

And I'ma die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar
I'ma die like a rockstar
Die like a rockstar

Sent your bitch a dick pic and now she need glasses
Turn your bitch Slick Rick right now if I flashed it
Ate a couple pills and took the bud up out the plastic
Flickin' bogey ashes, bitch, I stay blasted
Microphone Cassius, Magic with the sick shit
'Posed to been dead, but bitch, I'm still up in this bitch
Verbal herbal poison, words I contortion
Fucked a pregnant bitch, she save money on her ga-bortion
I feel like Billy Corgan in a church playing organ
Coverin' Too $hort, smokin' a Newport
Hurt, hoped the drugs would help the pain to go away
But all these thoughts up in my head made the sane go astray
So step inside the mind that revolves around the rhyme
And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines
Dyin' in the arms of a blonde, blue-eyed twenty-something
Don't know her name, but the paramedics chest pumpin'
Thirty-something Black male OD'd off of pills
That he weren't prescribed, but they took his life
Left behind a daughter that don't really even know him
'Cause her mama thought he wouldn't make a living off of poems
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoodie on and a jacket in the snow
Walkin' in the cold on the way to the studio
Nigga, that was just a couple years ago
Dropped a couple mixtapes on the 'net
Niggas tried to front like I wasn't all that
But guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Signed to Fool's Gold, now everything is all gnarly
Now these bitches want my number to get up in the party
Came a long way from extension cords in the window
Borrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the oven's never closed and the stove's never off
Every winter so cold, niggas sleepin' wearing scarf
But I always tell myself that it's gon' get better
You know who you is? You the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressure's on to prove that voice right
Some people never knew they goals, knew mine my whole life
So now his turn's up, fixin' up to bat
Pitchin' singles to the label when I used to pitch crack
I never learned to rap, always knew how
Ever since a nigga eight, knew what I would do now
When I turned twenty-eight, they like, ""What you gon' do now?""
And now a nigga thirty, so I don't think they heard me
That the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed
Tears in my eyes, let me get this off my chest
The thoughts of no success got a nigga chasing death

Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down in an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
Said, my forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't going make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm tripping, I'm slipping, feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
Said, I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smelling like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three, like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

I'm smoking, back to back, back to back, back to back

Only fear God, never sold on Him
Man, I swear to God, put my soul on Him

Should've died in Hell, but I rose on 'em

Pause, let it stop, hope we get by

Dropped out for a slanging degree

'Cause we was living in hell, couldn't afford property
Lil nigga gettin' frontin' from OGs
Oz of reggie bagged up in the Pelle
In a school hallways on a burnout celly
Leaving out of class early, caught a sale for 20
How long will it last?
Never ending race, chasin' cash
One lane going wrong way 'til I crash
Teacher find my sack, going nowhere fast

Tell me what I don't know
Last night homie got killed at the liquor store
Shot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher
Breaking down the weed when the call got received

We was so ambitious
All we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches
Flashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures
Thinking we was grown men, really lil' niggas
Jumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit
Taking turns catching sales things copacetic
Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce
Running through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis
Naive to the outcome
Cuz hit the block, hit the stash and they found some
Lock us all up for a bag and some pistols

Paranoid and think I’m seeing ghost-es, oh shit

Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off
Had a threesome last night, ain’t matter what it cost
Couldn’t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft
Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed
Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw
Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring
Your worst nightmare for me is a normal dream
And if I learned anything
Is don’t nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning
Knocking on my door but I won’t answer

Put that thang in her caboose
Only way you hang is with a noose
Beef with us, it ain't no truce
Y'all niggas lame, y'all ain't like us
Hanging with the devil off angel dust
For that money, in God we trust
All fall victim for greed and lust
Who you 'pose to trust when guns gone bust?
Living every day like it's the end
Just waking up, feelin' like a sin
Gotta keep a eye on your friends
Cause everybody hungry in them streets
Nigga rob ya grandma for something to eat
Know it's fucked up, that's how it be
Growing up living everyday in the D
And it don't seem like shit gon' change
No time soon in the City of Boom
Doomed from the time we emerged from the womb
So to cope, drugs we consume
Here we go, now, here we go
Ain't no water, how a flower gon' grow?
Ain't no change, then how we gon' change?
No umbrella, we stuck in the rain
Dark clouds hanging all over our head
No sunshine and them showers be lead
Lighting up squares and them dots be red
Now ya best friend gets shot in the head, damn

Shoot the house party up with them K's
Shut down when we hit the DJ
That Detroit shit, do the Rambisco
Minks and Gators, pistol the disco
Eating crawfish up in Fishbones
Heater off safety, watching the Pistons
Niggas get pissed on no-fly zone
Call Uncle Trick when you hit my home
Beef with him? Don't hit my phone

Coming from the city where them goons be lurking
Get caught slipping, yo ass will be hurting
That's for certain, yo ass be curtains
Young niggas out there puttin' that work in
On you scoring for a pair of Jordans
Whole damn city probably got a couple warrants
Why the county jail always stay crowded

Eating on an Adderall, wash it down with alcohol
Writing holy mackerel, actual all factual
Out for the capital, matador your capsules
Hassle the bitch in a castle with ill grapples
Tackled her asshole, my dick like a lasso
Fucked her in the mouth and washed it down with Tabasco

Uh, you softer than Flanders' son
Don't make me put hands on son
Jump niggas like fuck one-on-one
Used to be locked up watching One on One
And young Kyla Pratt was looking thick, a nigga wanted some
But soon as I got out, white bitches by the ton

One more touch and then you'll see
World of hidden mystery
Visions of you know you're only dreaming

I fuck bad bitches to Stacy Lattisaw
While you niggas got blue balls like an Avatar
I'm eating caviar in El Salvador
She runnin' from my dick like it's a bull and she the matador
She a pregnant Labrador
Said the metaphors are the highest caliber

The Shakespeare of sixteens, dipping my ink pen
Made a sculpture of me, but my dick was too thin
Paint pictures of me, but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures, bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging onto every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants 'cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero 'cause my words give 'em pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave 'em all astonished, ride with the verbs
Make a grown man cry with strength of the words

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that'll make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Have Virgin Mary doing lines in the pickup
Make Sarah Palin deepthroat 'til she hiccup
Have T.D. Jakes 'round this bitch doing stick-ups
Rhymes so real, thought I wrote it in Pac blood

Bomb filling smelling like napalm, your day's gone
Langston Hughes with a blew fuse and a screw loose
Maya Angelou, abused child with a notebook
Spitting like Kipling with a tooth missing
Tongue bring torture to men, women, and children
The memoir's sacred, hid in the basement
Await my next piece at a formal engagement
Crowds walk for miles just to hear that sound
Starting to get more power than the ones that wear crowns

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit

This is the wrath of Aquarius
I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
Humanitarian, bitch, I'm a veteran
Better than anyone comprehend
Snake in the grass, cut the copperhead
Hollow tips point at a copper head
Drop a head, poppin' the Glock 'til the copper dead
But Bishop killed Radames
That is the biggest hypocrisy
I don't see nobody stopping me
Bro, your whole life is a mockery
A militant, mind on a million
Civilian, I am the realest, bitch
No Gilligan, put me on an island
Smoking on an island 'til a nigga look Thailand
Spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus
Cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers
Federation in your area
If I'm a bitch, then I guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier, woof
Run all your paper, killer Curry keep on catching the caper
Dominating, common denominator
Aftermath, you can just do the math later, as a teenager
I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player

Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to one thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop

Heaven or Hell, huh, which one prevails, huh?
We gotta go and figure it out
I tried to tell you that this life isn't it
And I just wanna be the rightest I can be
Show my son to think so he can fly as high can be
Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sun is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z
Ándale, ándale, my intelligence for threes
Cancel me like I ain't the King of D.C
Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like ""Dance On Me""
Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies
You flashing all these lights, and you savin' these kids lives
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit
Take your turn to fire and to pitchfork, bitch
Hot pink, Valentine red
Black balloons, over my head
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float

Denzel, are you really making an album?
I'm telling you, eventually, they're gonna catch up to your game, you're running out of time!
Someone is really trying to hurt me!

Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back 'round, don’t let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

Eyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet on a airplane yelling, “Mayday”
With a good girl gone bad girl who went gay ’cause of date rape
That's a metaphor for the US 'cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised for the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it with my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! (Bang, bang, bang)
This for Trayvon and Tree, burn the bush and chronic, speakin' honestly
We livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies
Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States
Talkin' about “let's make a fort,"" talkin’ about “let’s make it great”
If the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot
Time to run with lions on the road to Zion
In this age of violence, time to grab the iron
When I pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when–

Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back ’round, don't let me down

Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

But they continue to shoot, I'm just gon' cover my head
I need to duck and not move (Yeah) I bust a move when I (Uh)
Find a way to get on and get up and get out the crib
I was just looking into the mirror
Tryna dislocate my fear 'cause you broke my heart
Let me dry my tears
So serious, I'm so neglected
In the wrong direction with a long erection
Got no protection but it's fuck the world
When she bend it over, being over-sensitive
But did I mention that my real intentions
Are on me really dealin' with the consequences
And I see your tone is very condescending
When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it
And I pity the fool
Been tryna vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
Just stop brushing me off to the side (Oh, shit)
Oh say, can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
By the dawn's early light, double Sprite and a R.I.P. tee
So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blaow in the night time
Of the slum house, little drum bump with the one thousand
Come-come, here they come
Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down
Birds chirpin', dogs barkin', kids missin', milk cartons
Soul dark as black markets, war is startin', more spartans
Lord, prophet, praise Muhammad, Different Strokes, Philip Drummond
Gave me crack, like I'm plumbin', Jesus Christ, second comin'
Cut myself, now I'm numbin', never scared, never runnin'
Chosen one, I'm one hunnid, pray for me, pray for London
Guilty me, he ain't done and gun me down, all for nothin'
Precedent in abundance, President is a puppet
Gotta hate it, gotta love it, pass a class, I rise above it
Wise enough, advise the public, pistol bust, screamin' “fuck it”
Donald Trump, Donald Duck, what the fuck is the difference?
Now we stuck in a rut, this ain't what I envisioned
What is what? What is guts when you don't have intuition?
Not a saint, not a sin, tell me, what's my real religion?

Back in high school, I admit I was a gook
But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me and Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class, bitch, I'm already smart
Yet I'm a gook, see me growing out my hair cause I look like the nigga from Roots
Yeah I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook
Nigga, that ain't nothing new
Yeah, I'm a gook, probably thinking that I'm fool if I told you that I'm rapping too
Yeah, I'm a gook, looking like that nigga Buu
Cut me off, I'm at the booth

I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!

Niggas can't fathom that I am the best
I gave you Threatz, Ultimate next
Shoutout the Klan because that's on the set
Fucking with me, I will put you to rest
Lie and you'll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck
Bitch, I'm gooking forever so give me respect, bitch!

Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

Like, she assigned to me, but you are designed for me
And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me
And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me?
And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me?
I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be
Unluckily, we not at peace
That's the end of my clover leaf
Wouldn't care if you know it's me
Keep away until you notice me

Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed

So, in a sense I sensed that all your innocence had died
You, swallowing all of your pride, won't, let anybody inside
As you cry me a thousand lakes on my shoulder blade, I say
Everything's gonna be okay
I'ma hold tight 'til I see the next day with you
Stay with you, play with you, pray with you and pray to you
Curry killed the pussy hoping that I could kill the hate in you
Even if you don't wait for me, forever I will wait for you

I went from stickin' pennies in the jar to offshore bank accounts
See me and my conglomerates is lucrative
I'm talkin' big money, big chains, big guns, nigga
More power

Big talk, speedboat (Speedboat)
Pray to God I don't get repoed (Repoed)
Didn't go to college for a free throw (Swish)
People gettin' killed through the peephole (Blah)
Have your money up before you go to war (Hmm)
Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24

Put the mask on like a luchador (Hmm)
My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24

Put a red beam to your head like Arby's
Either go to school, go to jail or the army
Keep a close eye on the things tryna harm me
Warn me if anybody try to swarm me, uh
Invest in the rock and a Rottweiler
Pile up hella stacks when the bills pile up
Dollar is the only way to get the style up
Riled up, catchin' motherfuckers usin' dial-up
My dawg is gone and the result is to have my teflon
Christian Dior and the fashion beyond
Talkin' Polo, call me Polow da Don
Throw some D's on the donk
I got hella keys and the funk
I put hella Gs in the vault
It took only three to assault, damn

My dawg didn't make it to 21, so I gotta make it past 24

Pourin' out scotch
Gas, all in my brain, it fumigated my thoughts
Thinking 'bout intricate plots
To get out the hood, that's when I started to jot
Not givin' the opportunity to let the devil ruin me, no
Even though the jewelry froze, ice cubes get Deeboed
Word on the street, everything heat
Everything hot boy, Texas Pete
Pulled up in a Lexus and a Jeep
All black, no tag, time for the sweep
Too many guns, too many sons
Lost in the river of blood in these streets
Master of none, pastors and nuns
Let's bow our heads for the ceremony
Jesus, please deliver us from evil
Please pray over all my people
What you see in life's illegal
I don't wanna use my desert eagle

Ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
La, la
Ah, ah, ah

Walkin' with my back to the sun, keep my head to the sky
Me against the world, it's me, myself and I, like De La
Got in touch with my soul
Treadin' softly on the path down the rockiest road
Life isn't ice cream without Monopoly dough
The property grows in value, and rightfully so, I gotta have it
I see the way the people get treated, it's problematic
They ready to set us up for failure, it's systematic
But when I felt it, my eyes melted
The selfish are constantly profitin' off thе helpless
I'll nevеr do my team green, make the team green like the Celtics
The ones that ain't makin' it overzealous, they show and tell us
Throughout history, earnin' cheddar
They form and break out nickel-plated chrome Berettas
The same ol' story in a whole different era
I'm watchin' massacres turn to runnin' mascara, but anywho
For the pain, see what this Henny do
So we can see what lies beneath as we pour up a swig of truth
The sun sets as I sip a few
The sky turns a different hue farther from the color blue
The nighttime has arrived, I recline for the evenin'
I'm hawkin' down the next goal, the name's ain't Stephen
I started in a nightmare so pinch me, I'm dreamin'
I'm killin' off my demons 'cause my soul's worth redeemin'

This history right here
What's up, my nigga?
It's time to empower these niggas, man, do it for the city
We gotta give it to 'em raw, though, you heard me?

Hair is nappy, knotty
Fuck karate, I got me a shotty
Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze
Origami if the neighbors saw me
But I won't fold, oh no
That's how the young boy's ass got smoked
Buddy got jacked like MK4
Sub-Zero, put a nigga on, so
Iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cousin of death, knowin' NY not my state of mind
211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime

Get the product, then we out the door
Mama, I've been twistin' weed and now it's time to lock the fro
Blowin' dro
Call me knotty head 'cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the project, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch, I can't be touched
Get the product, then we out the door
Mama, I've been twistin' weed and now it's time to lock the fro
Let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her 'cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

Life is melancholy, sellin' flock when they think it's molly
Bitches be givin' me sloppy, my pockets on Andy Milonakis
Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz, ""Rico Story"" when I see the coppers, damn
Golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm tree
Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me
Opposition remain obsolete when aimin' and targetin'
Monday to Sunday all you niggas, we slangin' like Pistol Pete, peace

Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fuckin' flow that's-s so belittles, man
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas – nigga, listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it – in turn, these critics and interns
Admittin' the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learnin' them digits and simultaneously
Dispellin' one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fuckin' six-nigga energy
And crawlin' down 'fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shoutin', thrashin', these niggas done let the kraken out
Crack-a-lackin' like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

'87 rooftop, Bronson
Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop – rollin' with that flow swamp
Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch

From a city that's recession-hit
Stress niggas could flex metal with peddle to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments, tryin' to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde, and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breakin' News: Death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fuckin' sky that you prayin' to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
*blow* – disappear again, reappear bearded
On top of a Lear, steerin' it into the kid's ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot, Earl
Rawer than a skinned knee cap on a blacktop
Salivary glands, lighter fluid for the matchbox
Strikin' – wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy, oh boy, I'm bad as burnt – pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the Little Nick, nimble, rickrollin'
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit

'87 rooftop, Bronson
Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up

Catch me over stove top – rappin' to that coke rock
Passionless in old Jive clothin', with them doors wide open
Dim the floor lights, focused like it's nothin', 'cause it's nothin', bitch
Quit with all that tough talk
Bro, we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down
Bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill – so test it, all my weapons is real
Sellin' thizz, couldn't tell 'em what the recipe is
Got 'em wishin' that they never gave these weapons to kids
Cheers, send chills up spines of fat bitches
After shows throwin' out sandwiches
Niggas get it how they live and I live for money
Other words, I'm gettin' money
Lil Boy told me when it's time to ride, they'll send up for me
Ain't nobody scarin' me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94, would've had 'em walkin' down death row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me, ""Wet 'em if they test you""
So it's Raging Waters season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seein'
Kitten soft but in they songs be trappin' hard as Jeezy
I don't believe it, but to each his own
I ain't trippin' long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em ""Free Smalls,"" off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief of police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby J, bony niggas sprayin' K's
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case

Something sinister to it, pendulum swinging slow
A degenerate moving through the city with criminals, stealth
Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work
""Golf"" is stitched into my shirt
Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly, I miss this nigga, like, when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it, I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze, cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened
It's evident in them eyes, where he hiding all them icicles at

Was mobbin' deep as '96 Havoc and Prodigy did
We were the pottymouth posse, crash the party and dip
With all belongings then toss em out to the audience
Nothing was fucking awesome
Trying to make it from the bottom
His sins feeling as hard as Vince Carter's knee cartilage is
Supreme garment and weed gardeners garnishing spliffs
With Keef particles and entering apartments with 'zine article
Tolerance for boundaries, I know you happy now
Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, ""I like attention""
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, ""Thanks so much,"" you made my life harder
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

I know it don't seem difficult to hit you up
But you not passionate about half the shit that you into
And I ain't havin' it
And we both know that I don't mean to offend you
I'm just focused today
And I don't know why it's difficult to admit that I miss you
And I don't know why we argue, and I just hope that you listen
And if I hurt you, I'm sorry, the music makes me dismissive
When I'm awake I'm just drifting, I'm not complaining
It's just to say that I stay pretty busy, lately
And I could be misbehaving, I just hang with my niggas
I'm fuckin' famous if you forgot, I'm faithful
Despite all what's in my face and my pocket
And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
You see, see, it seems that

All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um

I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three

When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you's a little different I don't like you a lot
I mean… fuck
I don't know what we're about
What good is West Coast weather if you're bi-polar?
If I'ma need this sweater, I'd rather be where it's cold

Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut
Crashing while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets, and laugh it off
Twisted, sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors, with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming, bitch, you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic, armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the ""ass"" in ""assassin""
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where her ass go
In my room, redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's O.F., buttercup, go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch, as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
""What you doing?"" – nothing much
Would shout some other stuff

No, fuck that, nigga, I got you

Grab mittens, who have to spit blizzardous
Actually, flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Ha, vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, mama and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, uh, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezel stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea-kettle songs
(Bitch-ass niggas!)

Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon

Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms

Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Mama taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga
I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
If you step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it don't give a fuck
Pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel, we had females coming every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately, I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job
Time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface

There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight

You could see it in my face, I ain't been eatin'
I'm just wastin' away
Looks like the way that River Phoenix went gon' end up my fate
And when they drag me out the gutter, mail the ashes to my mother
Twist the spliff if I don't finish my plate
Slip a fist up for my niggas in chains, my mental was caged
See, I ain't been to prison but the feeling's the same
Shared sentiment, when and if the pen hit the page

Matter fact, I am Farmer John milkin' cattle tracks
Action-packed, nipple squeezin', boy colder than sniffle season

So when the street is split, don't act surprised, agree with it

As deep as Dawson's Creek and shit
I pray they got gills either that or grab some floaties
I know I got skills, why you think I'm posted boastin'?
Braggin', tell these faggots to stop naggin'
'Cause them Wolf Gang niggas threw them off the bandwagon, like

Uh, was always fucked up as shit with it
But I didn't cross the line until the bridge hit it, troll
I got you niggas nervous like virgins flirtin' with Uncle Mervin
Fuckin' y'all with no lubricant, go grab the detergent
I preach to demons at your church, now I'm the newest sermon
Wearin' nothin' but they fuckin' blast with the matchin' turban
I drive through white suburbans in the black Suburban swervin'
Hittin' curbs and blastin' Erick Sermon, drunk off English bourbon
I'm stealin' purses, rapin' nurses, I'm a crooked surgeon
And treat the beat like sanitized Nazi puss, I'm a German
I'm squirtin' while I'm masturbatin' and regurgitatin'
From eatin' Miley Cyrus salad pussy platter they were servin'
My only purpose is to jerk it 'cause it has a curve
So bitches hate to do me like ex-convict community service

Hello Heather yellow feathers, now you ain't laughin', huh?

Bitch, you're barely breathin', leavin' on the back of the boat
While I fill you up with semen from the Wolf Gang team and
Flowin' like the creampie inside of your daughter
Oughta eat the bitch with salt and wash it down with a gallon of water
I grab the saw and sawed her arm off and auctioned it
And dip her teeth in gold molds and flossed the shit
Fuckin' awesome, spittin' box of trees
Got you niggas shakin' like it's Parkinsons
From the clitoris of Kelly Clarkson's dick
Ironin' you niggas now it's time to starch the shit
Drown your bitch in a tub of cum and throw a shark in it
Find a random abandoned garage and go to park in it
Find Earl laying on the burgundy carpet, pull my knife out
Sharpen it, stab him, put a arch on it
Pour unleaded gas on him, get the Zippo and spark the shit
Hop back in the van and then depart the bitch

After filling my reputation of whore beaters
Soared to Taco Bell and I ordered some gorditas (Mmm, that's good!)
Wanted four more, ordered 'em, didn't eat 'em
Then head to Thebe's house for some gymnastics
Fantastic, I backflip on this beat, B
Cause we running shit like the Dingleberries on four cheetahs
Flow colder than Papa Joe's, old Domino's
Fuck it, whatever
Um... Trashwang scratched inside the knucks
Got some One Direction tickets, I should hit that up
Drive by with puppy signs plastered on the truck
Then see how many of they fans could fit inside the trunk
Move over the microwave and the cannabis
Try to take the van and the whole band to Canada
Fuck the block news and the venues, they can't handle us
They can't stand us including fruits that Frank's channeling
The Ku Klux Klan see me and my managers
But thank me when they ask where the Five Panels is
Man, I suck now, I ain't still dope
But Chris and Rihanna's fuckin' again so there's still hope
Oh fuck, I went there, balling bitch, I'm Ben's hair
Y'all barely breaking like Taco's self-esteem in a thin chair
Old Navy bitches love this gap, yeah this grin's rare
Watch a nigga smile like five-year-old child
I'm kicking it with Nak and the nigga from Green Mile, it's
Red Bull in this cup so a nigga may seem wild but
That's just all the sherm I was burning a little while ago (Oh no)
Don't let me get hold of that rifle
Shout my nigga Sage Elsseser and Sean Pablo
Surrounded by them niggas that skate with a sick style
And some freckled bitches with giant peaches that's vile
They never did catch that rhino

And coppers labeled a  problem since paying for Damianos

Moral Orenthal with a pretty bitch in a Bronco
Hopped right off the seven and stumbled into some Vatos
Threw a punch, got jumped, dusted off and then walked home
Shit, it's like 6 P.M. and his temple throbbing
Hand in the cabinet by seven, sniff the prescription oxies
Logo in the boxes, all my niggas hostile
Cautious of your crosses, scoffing at your doctrines
Bitches augmented, stupid, as the group is, only slightly
Write precise to get a pussy nigga tooth chipped
Man these stitches shut the loose lips, stumbled in a Ruth's Chris
Slid into a booth and hid the luggage from his shroom trips
See, Lionel ball with Leonardo on the weekend now
And Maui on a scenic route, we on the second season now
Small fry got 'em seasons salty, weeded, coughing
Ease up off me, end is breathing easy as bulimics barfing
From a different breed of doggy, from a different seed and cloth
And teeing off, believe it's Golf Wang, nigga61Embed",https://images.genius.com/e90767062d94b2b76365824e37a56e17.770x770x1.png

Search inside my purse to buy something worthless

99 problems all gone in that one joint
And that neck gold froze like he held it at gunpoint
I'm a bubble in the belly of the monster
With a duffel full of troubles, trunk rattle in the Mazda
Ragged with the contra, ""Phantom of the Opera""
And I'm standing on the cop's truck, stacking for the long run
The bags packed, roadside with the thumb out
Toe-tagged, don't gag, spit your gum out
Nomadic, chrome-grabbing when it's danger
I'm a manger-born puppy, holding flight like a hangar do
Knife to the trachea, spit scabies and bet
The label don't like me, but they pay me a grip
And you see how his day going by the state of his wrists
Y'all niggas busy Play-Dohing, bet the baker came swinging like
What the fuck you saying? All that aiming and miss

Scheming on a Fanta and a Camel Crush, screaming, ""Saddle up!""
Like, ""Fuck is beef?"" Get your cattle cut, pansy
If them fans only local, why them flights transatlanti'ed up?
The rice and the patties cooked nice for the chancellor
Them teeth with the gold bright, the light switches mad at us
Snapchatting panty-clad baddies, I'm a bachelor
I'm high and polite 'cause po-lice is in back of us
And write with the same hand I smack 'em up with
Stretching out the fifteen I had initially

Fuck out my face while I'm thinking
Ain't step foot up in my momma place for a minute

Feel like I'm the only one pressing to grow upwards

Bet you thought he was solid
When he really just sand, washing away with the water
I'm a land mammal staying away from the altar
Shit changed in the August, in the wake of that August
Last autumn, the leaves fell, and I raked in the profit
Disobeying the doctor
The good guy prescribed faith, never called 'em
Chasing these rabbits, whole face in the faucet (Yeah)

Shrunk and widened with the bumps in my personal finance

Or reverse to the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket

I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas
Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man's game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
Norf Norf is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Until the money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

Kept the sticky in a Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sold sniff, Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at two, plotting, trying to garner loot
Split it with his big road dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found, uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amok

Covered trussled drugs, toughen up

Ma said, ""Wake up son, good morning""
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn, then
Paused to scratch and itch, and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention
'Cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But Mama wasn't havin' it
So I grabbed my bag and split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean, the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it, jaws hit the floor, so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say that I fucking hate you
But
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life rushin' through my body
But you got a guy that's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador
You light me up like lamps, a chance is all I'm really asking for
Give me one, I promise I'll be back for more
Most wanna tap and score, I want a fam of four

She said ""You rushing, you rabid son of a Labrador
But I'm attracted to you like teenyboppers to Apple Stores""
The basement light is darkened, the switchblade is sharpened
Her name on my arm and her face on a two-percent carton
See her face while you're fixing your breakfast
And know she's in my basement, objecting to sex with
Me, murder spree surges on with the next bitch

Black Ted Bundy, sick as John Gacy
Chilling with a possible victim, she was 18
A hitchhiker hippie whore, met her at the liquor store
She frequented to help support the habit picked up in the fourth
Grade A piece of ass, so I plan on screwing it
Slipped a couple Rufilin inside the bitch's juice and gin
Next thing you know, we're on Earl's burgundy carpet
She's kicking and screaming, begging for me to fucking stop it
Look, you know it's not rape if you like it, bitch
So sit down like a pretty ho and don't fight the shit
Or else I'll have to tie a pretty bow 'round your bloody neck
Hide the slices from the gashes given with a dull Gillette
Mop the blood up, put the body in the apartment
Stash it where we hide the marijuana and the condoms

Didn't have backup, I could tell by the Hummingbike
Reached to the glove, grabbed the motherfucking hunting knife
Stabbed him in his neck and hip, threw him in the trunk and dipped
Back to the fucking crib for some tea and crumpets, shit

Now they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment

Now I-I-I-I be kickin' shit like Solange in the elevator
The goal when you try to kick that dope, stuck on the respirator
Got symptoms of withdrawal from the fall when I used to ball
I show you how in one summer one nigga could lose it all
Like why we gotta feel this pain and her friends and family don't?
My cellie like to walk around in his sleep, I rather stay woke
I must evoke, these are the results of the realest shit that I wrote
These hoes get in your ear and burn that ass quick like Galaxy Notes

That's why I ride with that white-white, just like fight night we be weighin' in
VVS my pieces, 20 karat Jesus say amen
Tricked off on my new bitch, she was half black and Malaysian
Split my last two hundred thou' on a bird and Mercedes Benz
My dog used to pull up in a '99 GS-300
Fresh up off the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
First these hoes ain't want it
Now they only here to Michael Jones it (Mike Jones!)
Mama said you live next door to death if you live in the moment

I-I-I-I be kickin' shit just like Rodman did the camera man
I'm pure 100 dope like the poppy seed in Afghanistan
I been done dropped my nuts for this cabbage, hands do damage, nigga
Rips from the clip leave you stiff, Mannequin Challenge, nigga
Me and my chips with dip boy, ain't no play play 'bout that Frito-Lay
Tried to give me ten, I beat the case so it's gon' be okay
Fresh up on the highway with the higher power, how you want it?
Mama say I live next door to the death cause I live in the moment
Don't live in the moment
Don't live in the moment
I'll be there in the mornin'

Part 2

Yeah, Kane baby
I drink holy water

Quarter brick, half a brick, holy shit, whole shit
Scar across my face, strap on my shoulder on some Tony shit
Taught myself the streets, you know my pop ain't never taught me shit
'Cept, ""Fuck a friend, you gon' be solo in your coffin, bitch""
Walkin' home from work, my .44 bulldog what I'm walkin' with
Old folks out the church say, ""He need Jesus, that boy off a bit""
Preacher's daughter said, ""I'll let you fuck, it just might cost a bit""
Type of shit a nigga been through make you dog a bitch
Lost a bitch, married these streets, she prenup, you can't divorce her
Lyin' from my cell, electrical tape on my tape recorder, sucker shit
Don't blow your money, young nigga, pay your lawyer
Niggas is wrapped in electrical tape, they walkin' tape recorders, yeah
Yeah, bitch, your first motherfuckin' mixtape was a snitch tape
You ain't think I knew that shit though, I know though

Quarter brick, half a brick, holy shit, whole shit
Drove on 65, brought 65, I sold the whole shit
Po-po searched my Cutlass on the road, I got my Os hit
Boy you know the rules, they pick you up, don't call my phone bitch
Boy you know the rules, that shit don't jump unless you sold it down
S.W.A.T. team break, they cut the water off, can't flush the toilet down
454 my motor down, got green, got dog, got Yoda now
They playin' theyself for exposure now, this rappin' shit just for the posers now
The losers now
All these bitch niggas got videos up with their toolies out
Everybody flashin' real money
Niggas card crackin', gettin' Visa money
I don't knock it, I just do the dope and blow it
I gotta get it so I gotta see the money
Y'all remember peacin' out 28th
To get the blunt liquor and a piece of money, young nigga

Young nigga
Stay smooth, stay solid, nigga
These niggas'll put your name in everythin' but a prayer, amen

Glory be to God, what's happening, pimps?
It is I, the alpha and omega, the original righteous player
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
It's your boy Jesus, man
Yes my nigga, Jesus is your homeboy
Hahahahahah
Say it again so I can uh reiterate it, man
Your minds not ready and your heart's not open
You know what I'm sayin'?
That's what's wrong with you, man
You doin' all that covetin'
You tryin' to, you-you-you wan't what other niggas got
You not even just payin' attention to your gift, nigga

Yeah
Still too cool to love these hoes
All I wanna do is fuck these hoes
Still too cool to love these hoes
All I wanna do is fuck these hoes
(I love you, Freddie)

Once upon a time 'round '99 (Yeah)
I took a chick to the prom with a big behind (Aye)
She had a cute face, a thin waist, a bright smile (Yeah)
Titties mediocre, but ass was like, blaow
Might have been two thou' when I met that hoe
But on the low I used to sweat that hoe, I had to let that go
'Cause baby had me with a hell of a crush (Yeah)
Love letters on her locker, I ain't give no fuck
What other niggas thought about me (Still don't)
'Cause I was all about we, me and her 'til I D-I-E (Yeah)
Made me want to do some shit like carve her name in a tree
Like we was K-I-S-S-I-N-G
But little did I know she had a dude
With hella money, hella jewels, I was just another nigga in school (Yeah)
A straight fool, for thinking I was special or different (Yeah)
Lost my respect for the rest of the bitches (Ha)
I played hoes and shank hoes for bankrolls (Rolls)
Never thought they'd fill my heart with pain though
I would laugh when a broad made my niggas feel blue (Yeah)
But the jokes ain't funny when the joke's on you (Haha)
Let me stroke something boo, let me get that pearl (Yeah)
Touch your softest spot, let me in your world (Come on)
And you can be his girl, and that nigga can remain your man (Uh huh)
Freddie G'll be your back-up plan
You might also like x2
It’s how we do
Cause why have one when a nigga can have two
Three or four hoes I like the ass brand new
Just fuck with me and I'll stay true
“I love you""
Yeah yeah, I love you too
It's how we do, do, do-do-do
It's how we do, do, do-do-do
It's how we do, do, do-do-do

I had a bad bitch from Nap named Nicole
Nicole used to keep a nigga dick on swole (Yeah)
She knew I had a girlfriend, but she love my pole
And when she saw me with my woman, then she lost control
And went crazy, ""Freddie I can't believe you played me (Man)
People told me that niggas from the G was shady (Yeah)
You forgot you didn't wear a rubber when you laid me
I'm pregnant and it's your baby"" (Shit)
Hell of a bind, these hoes put me through a hell of a time (Real)
Met a girl last year that I thought was mine (Yeah)
Came all the way to NY to see me rhyme
Flew her ass out to LA for Christmas time
And shit was fine, we on the same beat
And she ain't got a problem with me being in the street
I know I ain't her one and only, but I'm hoping I ain't one of many
Baby pretty, but she tryna play me silly, 'cause she really
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout religion when she tell me the dick bomb
But then she up and left me 'cause I practice Islam
I guess Mom told her that the boy ain't right (Yeah)
And she gon' pray to Jesus Christ to take me out of her life
And out of her sight, she keep it undercover (Yeah)
I really used to mean it when I told her that I love her (For real)
But now I know that love is a four letter word
Like fuck and shit
So love, you can suck my dick11Embed",https://images.genius.com/c9a0de64e8b42a8635ec2fe5ddd9c41c.899x899x1.jpg

Take a life just to get a name
Came up with the crackheads, thugs and the cut-throats
Bloodshot from the blunt smoke
Man I'm so high that I can't even look my own momma in the eyes
Kicked out through the front door
She said the way a nigga livin', if I die, she won't be surprised
Tears on the Bible, she prayed for me
This can't be the life that she made for me
Got her lying to police when they raid for me
If there's a Heaven, will they open up the gates for me?
I wanted money for the summer, make a nigga trunk knock
Gang signs out the window, screamin' out, ""Fuck cops""
Soft dope, hard dope, get it all one stop
Slung crack rock, never had a wicked jump shot, yeah
Middle school, it was no joke
Hats broke to the right in the hall, it was all Folks
Little Lord had to lay low
Had a .38, I kept it in my locker, you ain't even know
I wasn't from their hood so the Westside niggas
They ain't really have no reason to respect a nigga
And since I went to school with them motherfuckers
Niggas from my hood actin' like they ain't accept a nigga
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out

Yeah, yeah
Diego, roll me one up, my nigga
Yeah, yeah, Kane, yeah

The future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
I admit that I was timid at a younger age, nigga
Daddy asked me what I wanna be, I said, ""A paid nigga""
Whippin' extras out the pot, I gave myself a raise, nigga
Heaven sent, I can't remember the last time I prayed, nigga
So the Devil introduced me to cookin' cocaine, nigga
On the blade, seven days, ain't bathe or shave, nigga
I was, thuggin' with my trey-eight
Motherfuck a president, I got a Presidential Day-date
I run a check up like a Chase bank
The police open up the package if your shipment come a day late
I just beat a rape case—groupie-bitch I never fucked
Tried to give me ten for some pussy that I never touched
At a certain level, system tried to test a nigga's nuts
Nigga hire like eleven lawyers—had to level up, yeah

Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright

Got me in this foreign prison, monkey in a cage, nigga
Bail paid, locked me up for an extra 30 days, nigga
Barely let us use the shower, ain't bathed or shaved, nigga
I was, sittin' in a cell missin' show dates
Commissary late, I'm postin' pictures with the toothpaste
Barely eat the food, stress'll make a nigga lose weight
Enter the mental of a nigga that wish he knew his fate
Shit these bitches do to try to get your cash
Erica visit, can't wipe her tears from behind the glass
Choppin' the porcelain up for years, said I'm suckin' glass
I beat the DEA and the task, now I'm on my ass
Future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
Donald Trump gon' chain us up and turn back to slaves, nigga
Got the recipe for dope, my reparations paid, nigga
Feel like that at some point, really I should feel ashamed, nigga
They kill us, we killin' us, but that is not the way, nigga
Money tree up in the stripper club, I'm throwin' shade, nigga
Did destruction on your flow when I paved the lane, nigga
Chest to chopper, blow your chest out, where your heart at, nigga?

Sent the hit out, I'm just waitin' on the call back, nigga
Shoot them pussies, burn it up, don't bring the car back, nigga

Slammin', used to sleep on the floor with a Kel-Tec
Got a bag I can't bag yet because it's still wet
Repo man, I pay him a visit, ain't paid his bills yet
Brain hemorrhage, blunt-force trauma, I make him feel that
I wrap and seal that
Sent out the bricks that had the Nike Swoosh stamps, I'm just doin' it for the camp
Nigga showed 'em to the plug, now he shoppin' behind my back, uh
One thing about that bitch karma, she comin' back
If you trappin', keep a strap close
Nowadays, this shit became a trend to snake your homies out 'cause everybody backdoor
But everybody Black, though
I let the fiends catch a bean, usеd to vomit off the secondhand crack smoke
Nigga got that PTSD from tеstin' the key
Gums numb, hope I didn't purchase work from the F-E-Ds
'Cause every time I see the judge, it's like a scary movie
Fuck the court, real nigga can't do no jury duty
Internet done altered this shit through a different game now
I don't rap about dead opps, I let his name die
Shame how they blackball Kane, they scratched my name out
I pushed it longer than I expected to get my name hot

They wanna take me out this game like Sha'Carri
Black Illuminati, touch Big Rabbit, streets need a body
I got all of them leeches away from 'round me
You ain't rich enough to get me hit, pussy, go up the bounty, uh

Turn the witness to Stevie Wonder, ho, you ain't seen shit

Now I push the goons through the boondocks in the Countach
Penthouse in the city, my bops givin' me rooftop
Told 'em free my nigga G-Weeder, ho, let the Whoops out
You feel my energy, they gon' remember me
Ain't never had a friend like me, your enemy my enemy
Lambo crashed the whip and got plates in both shoulders
If he didn't live through that accident, this shit could've been over, yeah

They wanna take me out this game like Sha'Carri
Black Illuminati, afghan doggy straight off the poppy
I ain't trust him, had to dust him like Christopher Moltisanti
And it hurt my heart to hurt you, but nigga, streets need a body, yeah
I don't house these hoes, bitch, get a hobby
She ain't workin', then you ain't got a wifey, you got a Tommie, yeah
I got all of them leeches away from 'round me
Bulletproof the Escalade, I got iron like Robert Downey, nigga, yeah

Fuck you lil' niggas (Uh)

Kane
Kiss, haha
It's what we do, nigga
I don't do the Chrome Heart, I just do the home art
You can catch a headshot or you can catch a dome dart
Go ahead and put the kids to sleep, this the grown part
'Fore we knew what Billboard was, we had our own chart
Strapped and they pull the car over, you take your own charge (Take that)
I ain't never worked for nobody, I sold my own hard (That's right)
Smoke a fat one in the back right in my own yard
Playin' dominoes with my man, he in the boneyard
Now I can pay for the jet right on my own card
Niggas tryna go man on me, I'm in the zone, God
Hand-to-hand with it, I ain't never played the phone, God
Calisthenics and cardio, just tryna tone, God (That's it)
Your man got the semi, but he ain't poppin'
My youngin got the bricks in the hemi, and he ain't stoppin'
Lil' extra in the beginning to get him coppin' (Uh-huh)
He ain't worried, 'cause if they get him, I get him Cochran (I got him)
He know not to fuck with them bitches, they get him hot then (He know)
Stay low, finish the work, he get a drop Benz (Yeah)
They just wanna be around money, but they are not friends (Nah)
Until you fall back from 'em, that's where the plot ends (Yeah)
I've been reppin' the Apple since it was rotten (Mmh)
When you a G.O.A.T., then you can never be forgotten (Never)
They gotta ram it, you don't ever let the cops in (Never)
I can have your funeral in the top ten (Woo)

Who gave these niggas this flow, you know what I'm sayin'?
Baby Scarface

I first tasted cocaine in 10th grade
Homie at the table choppin' Rick James
Sent the package off from Texas, it's been six days
Keep it sweatin' like a pig until that bitch came
Nigga had to keep a job, livin' off in my momma's spot
Fuck it, I'ma bust a fuckin' jugg, I'm a juggernaut
Pop a zone and drop it off in that water, we was cookin' out
Loud packs and molly powder all these niggas pushin' out
Feds lookin', cause I peddled paint to these poor folks
The realest niggas that I know ain't never sold dope
The hardest niggas that I know ain't never served time
Soon as I got me thirty thousand, I hit the bird line
And I brought that dog back to the set, niggas know me for that
Shout out to my niggas from D.C. with them scorpion packs
Keep this strictly business, you can't mix up your homie with that
One day you might have to clap a nigga, no glory in that
Feel like I'm outgrowin' all my friends, niggas thinkin' small
Gon' have to write them all a check, just to get the shit resolved
Then turn right back around and write them another one when they trick it off
Get successful and watch how quickly niggas get in their feelings, dawg
Get successful and watch how you immediately become their competition
Niggas worse than a side bitch, they can't quite stay in a position
Don't know what niggas crave more, money or a-fuckin-ttention
And these the niggas I'm cool with, my enemies I have yet to mention

I got cake, bitch, everyday be my birthday
You can't take me, I'm first place on my worst day
Streets dry, niggas thirsty, so I pray that when they come and take me
That this mini Draco make the earth shake
Have a nigga on some ""underneath the earth""shit
My nigga Shermie caught a murder on his first lick
These animalistic instincts that we was born with
Felt so pimpish when Alexys put me in the foreign whip
Black as hell but rap got me thinkin' I need a foreign bitch
Takin' my black queens for granted, got me ignorin' them

Names I be callin' her, nigga know you be doggin' her
What kind of man is you to you little niece and yo' daughter and 'em?
I’m posted at the stove with that yola, that soda lockin' in
Ving Rhames guns and butter, niggas get margarine
Pussy niggas can't play they part, we dearly departed them
Quick like OJ Simpson, you Bart, Homer, and Marge and 'em
I rap but I keep weight, and I know the streets take
Niggas out the game, my baby momma told me be safe
Turned around and said, ""Fuck safe, I stay dangerous""
In the set with Sodi, no chopper, my chain danglin'
In the set with Deuce, I be Bloodin', we gang gangin' 'em
My nigga Corleone and Diego, they smash craniums
Livin' life on high speed, nigga, that's just the lane we in
'Bout to cop a Porsche from that the packet that Freddie Kane gettin'
I got cake, bitch, everyday be my birthday
You can't take me, I'm first place on my worst day

Rob me a nigga
Rob me a, rob me a nigga
Cause the bills too high, this nigga right here too fly
And right now I might just rob me a nigga

The liquor got me lurking and looking for a lame nigga
To set up for my next lick
In the Chevy, about to roll up the stress, with a Tec
And what he got on his neck, got him a death wish
It's kinda funny cause he used to be my nigga tho
We was breaking bread, flipping bricks like a year ago
Shit can get into a nigga's head when his digits low
Make you wanna send one of your friends to his funeral
Maybe me and him was never friends in the first place
Don't mean a thing cause we share the same birthplace
Same city, same hood, but we down to kill each other for a dollar
Cause we want it in the worst way
Money talk and bullshit gon walk a marathon
And I ain't scared of getting killed cause I'm getting mine
And if they ever try to raid, I'mma hit the fuckin pigs with the K's
I ain't tryna do a lick of time
Spend all my last money, the bills too high
His jewelry, his whip game, the wheels too fly
I'm thinking about murder every time we cruise by
Heard he got like 84 elbows of blue fire
In the basement, muthafuckas still think basic
Thinkin' I won't show up and erase 'em, but I ain't gonna chase 'em
I'mma be up in his crib waiting
""Bitch where the cash? I can taste it""
Put em on their faces: what you know about kidnapping
And holding a nigga's whole family for ransom?
When your stomach empty it's easy to understand it
Got me out here taking them penitentiary chances
""Born in this world of tears, will die laughing""
Put that on the headpiece right above my casket
Still in the game, my batteries still lastin
Bout to put some gas up in my Caprice Classic, and...

Bet this hundred round drum pussy nigga thinkin twice
Fore he try to run, shots spit, and the cops come
All they seen was my golds and a black mask
Throw the car round the corner, tinted up with no tags
All these niggas wanna flash, Ima put it to they ass
With the K out, ask a nigga, “Where da sack at?""
Give it here, you wanna die for that rolex?
You can either get your life or that watch back
Ima shoot you point blank, I’m just hoping you think
You can take it as a loss, you can get it back
Nigga, buck and get shot, that’s the street code
I’m leave you there, do you, that’s how the shit go
Just another episode, A-K explode
In his head, left a smoke hole
Be a shamed if you died over fake shit
But that’s a lesson, if you out here on some fake shit
Come and robbin everyday, know the young nigga hungry
They be murkin for a quarter brick
Know they kill a whole fam for the whole thang
All the shooters up in Gary on the same thang
All the little homies strapped, so they look plain
Gun shots rang out, nigga, see flames
We be takin so much, now the shit fun
We be lookin for your shit fore your shit come
Forty eight hours, nigga round my way
Everyday nigga lookin like a sitcom
In this game of lose or draw nigga
You can be the one that get robbed
Or be the one to rob a nigga
But we all gotta eat, so we get no sleep

Lifestyles of the insane
Eastside thug nigga, I'm the shit, you a shit stain
I let the boxframe switch lanes
Not a pretty nigga, but I got some game for a bitch brain
And I lay it on so thick
Charge it all to a broad, heard a pimp nigga quote this
And I'm allergic to a broke bitch
I think I need my medicine, I had to po' up 'fore I wrote this
And doing dirty keep a nigga with a deep pocket
Dope fiends and the cluckheads keep shopping
Steady praying that the yayo keep locking
Keep a strap cause the jackboys keep robbing
Got me pulling up slow
Whip another clip and put my pedal to the floor
Slamming Cadillac doors, working wood like a pro
Ass sit on nothing but that leather, whatcha know, how you living, nigga?
Lifestyles of the insane
Roll the kill, pop a pill, crack a seal, I resist pain
Niggas looking for that big stain
Dirt weed, dog food, fye kush, niggas flip 'caine
Think I lost my religion
Stepping on a pack, break 'em off in the kitchen
Chevy topped off with the chrome in the engine
Niggas gotta floss, that's the cost of this pimping, I'ma pull up slow

Motherfucking white chalker, might've caught ya
In the streets with your pants down
Tell 'em call the paramedics, nigga man down, ease up
If you thugging, get your Gs up
And never fake, never fraud, never fold, never freeze up
A black mask, black tee'd up
The motherfucking dope game feed us, how you living, nigga?
And rest in peace to my motherfucking homeboy
But hold your tears, he ain't die, he just a fuckboy
You might as well be a dead man in my eyes
2-2-3, sucker-free when I ride

Selling things to the smokers in the mobile homes
A pack of backwoods, dirty styrofoam, and a pocket full of stones
And my Cadillac Brougham, I'ma pull up slow

Solid as a motherfuckin' rock, bitch

When you fall, who you gon' land on?
Niggas foundation is shaky, ain't shit to stand on
A man's born with the only guarantee to live and die
But will I die before I live, 'fore I begin to fly?
Nigga, I can't deny when I'm not high, I miss that rush, that shit be callin' me
Demons never rest, I go to sleep, them bitches follow me
I just bought a AR for my dog, he walked the dog for me
Breakfast and promethazine with Ocean Spray and broccoli
Chase these hoes and I act like I can't keep these bitches off of me
They only fuckin' a nigga that got the most dollars in your squadary
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
That Bentley, Benz or Beamer, shippin' B's, I don't be in it
Not to let these bitches see me in it, fuck a ceilin'
Nigga wanna be me, even Steve could see the G in him
She work in the mornin', get that pussy in the PM then
I get in it then I jetted, it was a fly by, red bottoms, the thigh high
And every time she see me, she's sayin' ""I don't know why I
Fuck with niggas like you 'cause at first, you would play the shy guy""
Give me that pussy once and I always got it like the Wi-Fi, bitch
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
I remember when Dukie lost his arm in fuckin' armed robbery
When I seen his shit was danglin', almost felt my heart stoppin' G
Stop it G, drop it G, so much weed, forgot to breathe

Came out that bitch, I'm speakin' Russian, German, Guapanese

Got me tore up from the floor up
Gang signs, gang handshakes every time a nigga show up
All the real niggas know us
Back in '09, me and Lam, we was looking for a way out
But ain't nobody want to show us
Riding 'round, selling blow, shotgun doors out his Volvo
Must have sowed a whole O up
And you stuck it out with me, I love you like a brother
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have no rap career or nothing
I know you hate the fact that I'm so loyal to my street affiliation
But my niggas need a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
Willie and Diego need a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
My nigga Butter hit me for a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
And now the DEA, they checkin' on me when I'm gettin on a plane
Double life, it got me ducking undercovers
I just want to be legit man, shit man
And every time I touch the dope, I say that this gon' be my last flip man
I got a shorty that's willing to sell it for me
She my lover, my homie, the devil cursed me with a pimp hand
I hope my daughter never lives this type of lifestyle
Creeping under streetlights as a night child
My uncle still can't put the liquor or the pipe down
Meanwhile I'm in this kitchen whipping up the white gal
Plus I got addictions of my own, boy
The pills into laced blunts got me gone, boy
The Oxycontin and heavy syrup got me looking in the mirror
Saying, ""Is you a dope fiend or a dope boy?""
Smoking on some shit that I can't pass to a nigga
Eyes shiny than a bitch, glass to a nigga
Down to kick in the door, .44 mags to a nigga
Got some habits I pray that I never pass to a nigga
All about the dollar signs, fuck the sympathy
And fuck police cause they killing you and killing me
Slanging and banging, my paper stay getting fatter
So do black lives matter when you 'bout to kill your enemy?
I need to know it, drop that paper boy don't be heroic

After all these years carrying this shame with us
Now the entire planet is going insane with us
Seven year old kids carrying flame spitters
Fortified fences, mortify senses
Crossfire missed my little daughter by inches
Chemical dependence, medical expenses
But no amount of money on earth can buy vengeance
Writing a life sentence, sirens, fire engines
Tyrants seen through the eyes of the wide lenses
Senseless crimes cause some of us want to drive Benzes
But are you tryna ride with us or against us?
As long as they kill us
And go to Wendy’s and have a burger and go to sleep
They gon' keep killing us
But when we die and they die
Then soon we gon' sit at a table, and talk about it, we tired
We want some of this earth
Or we'll tear this goddamn country apart!

You feel that? (If you're my down-ass bitch)
Yeah-yeah (Uh, yeah, down-ass bitch)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Big Rabbit)

No gold rings, this shit just my main squeeze
Coming to the crib, breaking down a set of keys
Back in the days, I admit, I had some issues (Yeah)
Took twelve on the chase, I jumped out, I crashed the rental
But you my down-ass bitch (Yeah)
The one that'd never fuck up or snitch
I fleed the scene, a hit and run, I left the Glock with the switch
Police gon' press you, we got lawyers, baby, don't tell 'em shit (Don't say shit)
And I be rock-rock-rockin' 'til the cops come knockin' at my
College girl, got her stressin', she got a jail record (Damn)
I put the Range in her name and I'm fuckin' up her credit
The judge gave her probation, he had knots in her stomach
After the case, she wiped her Instagram and changed her number (The fuck?)
Damn, bitch, thought we was gang, I would've killed for her
Ex nigga got you engaged, that nigga kneeled for her (You running with this nigga?)
Heartbreak most thug niggas ain't built for it
Tears steady droppin' 'til the cops come knockin' at my

Matured all the sorors and every AKA
Michelle's blueprint showed the error in their ways
All the rent I paid, you know I play it fair
Just leave an extra key so I can weigh it there
Bribe money so your boyfriend wouldn't lay up there

Fridays are draft night, you bitches is one-and-dones
I am the one of one, I am the summer son
I am the street dream, Nas with the cummerbund

The dope floats on a boat, now come give the drummer some
They going for thirty-three, I just let the numbers run

Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris

Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk

Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects

Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it

See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son

Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve

And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)

Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (They wasn't cool, they wasn't cool)

Then Usher Raymond ""Let It Burn"" came on (""Let Burn"" came on, ""Let Burn"" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (Free our mind, free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (See dollar signs, see dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
A silver spoon, I know you come from, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (We never knew, we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's jus how I feel
Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's jus' how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with

If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood

Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
He'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
He'll make it (He'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
Woah (Woah)
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!,"" X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (No mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap

The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll ask again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock

I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast
Like this in a long time, don't you see that long line?
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream, ""It's alive!""
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, I'm talkin'
Poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS

Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say

Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright

What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all

I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me

Goddamn I feel amazin', damn, I'm in the Matrix
My mind is livin' on cloud nine and this 9 is never on vacation
Start up that Maserati and – vroom-vroom! – I'm racin'
Poppin' pills in the lobby and I pray they don't find her naked
And I pray you niggas is hatin', shooters go after Judas
Jesus Christ, if I live life on my knees ain't no need to do this
Park it in front of Lueders, next to that Church's Chicken
All you pussies is losers, all my niggas is winnin', screamin'—

All my life I want money and power
Respect my mind or die from lead shower

Put fire to that ass, body cast on a stretcher
And her body got that ass that a ruler couldn't measure
And it make me cum fast, but I never get embarrassed
And I recognize you have what I've been wantin' since that record
That Adina Howard had pop it fast to impress her
She rollin', I'm holdin' my scrotum imposin'
This voice here is golden, so fuck y'all, I goes in, and—

Respect my mind or, nigga, it's go time
I roll in dough with a good grind
And I run that ho with a baton
That's a relay race with a bouquet
They say, ""K, you goin' marry mines""
Biatch! No way, biatch! No way
Biatch! No way, biatch! Okay

When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— 
You might also like
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

""Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?""
""Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!""
""Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.""
""We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.""
""Bring a nigga back a black!""
""Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga... Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back.""

""Ahh, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?""
""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now.""
""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus' name, amen""
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day

Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some Black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

I said I'm geeked and I’m fired up (Fired, fire)

Girl, you look so good, it's to die for (Die for, fire)
Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for (I’m on fire)

It's a secret society
All we ask is trust (All we ask is trust)
All we got is us
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty
Loyalty, loyalty, loyalty

Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millennium
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now

Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I’m a natural, I'm alright

I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah (Yeah)
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside (Yeah)
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope

Honestly forever, all a real nigga want

Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart

Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? (Mmm)
Do it end with your family and friends? (Mmm)
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for

Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(Ah, one two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
I done been through a whole lot (Kendrick Lamar!)
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie (Make some noise, brother!)
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And (I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy

Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh
These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation (Come to the front, yeah)
I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace (Oh, yeah)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-
And (I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

All ya'll come to the front, ya'll come up to the front

Baby, what about you? Come on

(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga
(I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right (Oh no)
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body—

Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids, bro

Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
How many— Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?

Exactly, so we— we ain't got time to waste time, my nigga
Niggas gotta make time, bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that, bro
You know that

Exac— enough said, enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty, my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen, listen to this:

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said, ""Think about what you saying: ""Fuck niggas""
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

Uh-uh, fuck that

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is Black, she Black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got ADHD

Woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Woah, woah-woah

And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
""Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?""
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ""Okay, then we are crack babies,"" damn
""Why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax""
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, ""Read between the lines,"" yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood""
""You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
The ADHD crazy""

Poverty's paradise
I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
(I've been hungry all my life)

What's up, family?
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart""
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth

With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
(I've been hungry all my life)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
I'm high now (Huh), I'm high now (Huh)
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To Pimp a Butterfly

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?

When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (We’re on top together)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front, ""I'm On One""
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell, it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six

(W-W-W-What is it?)

Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by that nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got they mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cuttin' school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and an arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, ""If he dies, he dies""
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwin' punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red
Blood on your diamonds 'til you dyin', dead, yuugh

You wanna see a dead body?
Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother cryin'
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealin' it
Hit the pipe and start feelin' it
Ooh-wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, jeez louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took an L, started sellin' soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusin' his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, ""Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said, ""Son, how come you think you'll be my connect?""
I said, ""Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect""
He said, ""Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense""
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend
Now the same shit that y'all was smokin' is my profession, let's get it

The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until ""Annie""
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby?
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?
Your rap songs is all tryin' my patience
Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit
Moynat bags on my bitches, I done blew it
See through it, neck, igloo it

Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here

Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious, it’s ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
'Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life’s a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like ’86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God’s got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home

Hold all of them missing weapons

Tripped on Bristol Palin then I accidentally shot 'em
Then it ricocheted and killed the game, I'm a problem

Soaked, getting jiggy with it in Bel-Air's richest

Who else could put the hipsters with felons and thugs
And paint a perfect picture of what sellin' it does?

Two different worlds, same symmetry

Now that the tears dry and the pain takes over
Let's talk this payola (Payola)
You killed God's baby when it wasn't his will
And blood spill, we can't talk this shit over (This shit over)
The Lord is my shepherd, I am not sheep
I am just a short stone's throw from the streets
I bring my offerin', I will not preach
Awaken my demons, you can hear that man screaming
I'm no different than the priest, priest
Santería (Santería, Santería, Santería)

They say that death comes in threes, how appropriate ('Propriate)
Triple back, they rush in like Soviets (Soviets)
At the Kremlin
Searchin' for the green like a Gremlin, presidential emblem
Presidential tint on this shit that I am driven in (Woo!)
I just place orders and drop dollars
Rottweilers roam the grounds, the Glock hollers
The three of y'all too accessible
Seen all the wrong moves, watchin' The Untouchables
We don't do vegetables, niggas get flatlined
Welcome all beef, then we heat 'em with flat irons
Your plans are backfiring, think of double-crossin' a priest
Hail Mary, repeat after me
Santería!

I bet when we draw blood, you niggas will draw a blank
Dress you in all black, partnered with All Saints

Cold nights when you couldn't sleep

In elevator condos, on everything I love

This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours

Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out

'Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks

Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Tap-tap, throw the phone if you hear it click

While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha

And rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star

I sold more dope than I sold records
You niggas sold records, never sold dope
So I ain't hearing none of that street shit
'Cause in my mind, you motherfuckers sold soap
Got rich selling hope to the hopeless
But I'm a thinker, methodic in my motives
I motivate to put my niggas into motors
No woman, no child, no witness, no Jehovahs
Like Scarface but it's God's face in that mirror
We was made in His image, dialing and it's much clearer
Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer
Aryan, blonde hair, blue-eyed like the Führer
The judge and the jury, the jewellery mad froze
Watercolors on my neck, fuck rhyming when you blinding niggas
We ain't the same color clarity of diamond, nigga
Nah, I ain't got nothing in common with yous
Pain in my heart, it's as black as my skin
They tipping the scale for these crackers to win
No reading, no writing, made us savage of men
They praying for jail but I mastered the pen
Descended from kings, we at it again
Just hand me the crown, I'm active again
Everything that it seems, hear my passion again
Was never my dream, the immaculate win

I was pissing my shorts, having rich nigga thoughts
Wish I had a pistol before all the friends I done fought
Overnight I seen a nigga go get a Carrera
Two weeks later I had to be that boy pallbearer
Young king bury me inside a glass casket
Windex wipe me down for the life after
Crack dealer living like a hoop star
Black marble, white walls in my new spot
Four chains, big studs, a nigga too fly
Top down, tank top, I think I'm 2Pac
So I'm labeled the rebel, nigga get on my level
We were born to be kings, only major league teams
Chasing my paper, couldn't fathom my wealth
Built a school in Ethiopia, should enroll in myself
God body and mind, food for the soul
When you feeding on hate, you empty, my nigga, it shows
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slip and you fall I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, can't be hiding for long
I seen children get slaughtered, niggas' grandmothers assaulted
Throw a gang sign, dare you do something about it
Fuck copping them foams, when you copping the home
Cop a kilo and have them people on top of your home
Follow the codes, ain't no love for these hoes
If you slipping you fall, I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on
By the end of this song, I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
I got you, my nigga, hold on
If you right or you wrong, if you riding, come on

We dropped a classic today (What)
We did a tablet of acid today
Lit joints with the matches and ashes away
SKRRRT! We dash away
Donner and Dixon, the pistol is blasting away

Doctors of death
Curing our patients of breath
We are the pain you can trust
Crooked at work
Cookin' up curses and slurs
Smokin' my brain into mush
I became famous for flamin' you fucks
Maimin' my way through the brush
There is no training or taming of me and my bruh
Look like a man, but I'm animal raw

We are the murderous pair
That went to jail and we murdered the murderers there
Then went to Hell and discovered the devil
Delivered some hurt and despair

Black on black on black with the ski mask, that is my crook look
How you like my stylin' bruh? Ain't nobody smilin' bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh
Where my thuggers and my crippers and my blooders and my brothers?

Or take over a jail, give them COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur, goddamn, I love the smell

And when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him
We killin' them for freedom 'cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em

We, we out of order, your honor, you're out of order
This whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a flip wig synonym livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian, I'm fucked from the jump

Just spit it disgustin', youngin', and hold your nuts while you gunnin'
I listened, tatted the sentence on my dick last summer
Now I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin'
Waitin' for their christenin'
I know the neighbors can't help but listen in, uh
A dirty boy who come down on the side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison
The only solace I have is the act of conjugal visiting
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Though mainly missin' my missus, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is given vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers, enslavers of men and women
Including members of clergy that rule on you through religion
So strip your kids to the nude and then tell 'em God'll forgive 'em

Prolly got a year or ten to go, so let's go
I don't really know how to go slow
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker's cold (Ayy)
You in the wrong mode, you open and closin' your hole, it's a no go
This whole world's a shit moat, filled to the brim like Gitmo
When you think it don't get mo' low it limbo 'til the sticks on flo'
All oppression's born of lies, I don't make the rules, I’m just one guy
All due respect, if getting spit on's how respect is now defined
Hungry for truth but you got screwed and drank the Kool-Aid, there's a line
It end directly at the edge of a mass grave, that's their design
Funny fact about a cage, they're never built for just one group
So when that cage is done with them and you still poor, it come for you
The newest lowest on the totem, well golly gee, you have been used
You helped to fuel the death machine that down the line will kill you too (Oops)
Pseudo-Christians, y'all indifferent, kids in prisons ain't a sin? Shit
If even one scrap of what Jesus taught connected, you'd feel different
What a disingenuous way to piss away existence, I don't get it
I'd say you lost your goddamn minds if y'all possessed one to begin with

The way I see it, you're probably freest from the ages one to four
Around the age of five you're shipped away for your body to be stored
They promise education, but really they give you tests and scores
And they predictin' prison population by who scoring the lowest
And usually the lowest scores the poorest and they look like me
And every day on the evening news, they feed you fear for free
And you so numb, you watch the cops choke out a man like me
Until my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, ""I can't breathe""
And you sit there in the house on couch and watch it on TV
The most you give's a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy
But truly the travesty, you've been robbed of your empathy
Replaced it with apathy, I wish I could magically
Fast forward the future so then you can face it
And see how fucked up it'll be
I promise I'm honest
They coming for you the day after they comin' for me
I'm readin' Chomsky, I read Bukowski, I'm layin' low for a week
I said somethin' on behalf of my people and I popped up in Wikileaks
Thank God that I'm covered, the devil come smothered
And you know the evil don't sleep
Dick Gregory told me a couple of secrets before he laid down in his grave
All of us serve the same masters, all of us nothin' but slaves
Never forget in the story of Jesus, the hero was killed by the state
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold (Cold, cold)

Who really wanna run it with the Jewel Runners?
Go hellfire hot in a new sauna
It's a cold winter, baby, and a cruel summer
I suicide bomb in the blue Hummer
And emerge out the side, not a bruise on 'em
Bad news come in twos, son, do somethin'
Treat beats like a wet thigh, chew on 'em
Got a stroke row crew on 'em, move on 'em
We be the heroes, the breakers of chains, and the busters of locks (Locks, locks)
You be them suckers supportin' them snitches that talk to the cops
This the Illmatic of turning your face into fucker foie gras
I'm not so sure opportunity's knocking, it's probably the law
Word to the old school tape decks
I get Radio Raheem respect
My Nike pendant sacred
Similar to the Ghostface bracelet
Fire in the hole, oh, no joke
Prolly go broke just off smoke
Fuck are we gonna do, not smoke?
Get a job, play the role, be adults?
Nah, I'ma do me, arigato
First of all, they cheated (Haha)
'Cause they, one of 'em black and the other one white (Uh-huh)

Look at who we done blessed with our trust
I don't think we'll be left with too much
Hand on my heart and my mind on my drugs
Got a Vonnegut punch for your Atlas shrug
They love to not love, it's just that dumb
Lord, sweet Buddha, please make me numb
Brain bounce off walls like a sentient Roomba
Just found out his creator's stupid
Lit by the supermoon, I'm too lucid
Plus got shrooms in the blood, I'm zoomin'
Beep beep, Richie, this is New York City
The X on the map where the pain keep hitting
Just us ducks here sitting
Where murderous chokehold cops still earnin' a livin'

Smoke from the loosie drift, hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose, I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of being excellent; the median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold
Authorities have spoken, demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground while the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano, y'all know, kinda batshit
The bright lights of fuckery stuck in me, automatic
I’ll teabag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who’ll swim like directly after he's eaten
While holdin' a toaster oven that's plugged with a fork in it
'Cause death by electrocution's like life in New York, i'n it?
Should've been a dentist, mom said it pain's the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors that I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop, I can chop it up with X-Acto touch
What's the rush?
Autograph skin flaps, tag 'em up
I don't brag enough, you de facto suck
A lot of you new to the El Producto milieu
Kinda like, ""Fuck is you?""
I'm a little black spot on a sun of lies
But I'm not too high to say I'm the truth
I line the booth to catch blood like a Bateman
Nathan sacred, I'll mace a play pen
Jewel runner, bitch, make the name stick

That was me in BK on Atlantic
Never looked both ways, ran in traffic
Pops went away but I stayed, vagrant
Placed where the steel and cement became nature
Love what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous
Cityscape where the blood of good men courses
And the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain
Take a knee to the gods and get horse shit
Wanna live for the thrill? They'll arrange it
Got a bevy of imps to spit hatred
Shit'll get in your head and cause panic
Have you desperately begging to get famous
Get your dignity dirty and left orphaned
Sanity on the fringe of distorted
Who are they to just take shit and hoard it?
Who am I that I don't get my portion?
The most impressionable minds
Get molested and informed by manipulating forces
Don't fret, little man, don't cry
They can never take the energy inside you were born with
Knowing that, understand you could never be poor
You already won the war, you were born rich
You can only take the energy you had
Going back to the realm or the home where your lord is
Whoever, whatever that lord is
Couldn't give a fuck if you ever made fortunes
Fuck anyone ever tryin' to run that bum shit
Send 'em to the flames where the orcs live
Them and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us
Don't understand love's importance
And we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth
Where the ashes and dust got formed in

The beat breaks and your teeth break
Keep your canines embedded in my knuckles as a keepsake
It would seem your veneers just mere souvenirs
Falling out your mouth and on to the landscape
Me and El-P do the secret handshake
Then I pummel punch a pumpkin head punk in his pimple face
'Til he's punch drunk 'cause he's sweet as a pound cake
(Ain't he pussy, Mike?) Yeah, El, I'll say
Into the wild, wild style ghetto child running wild
Where the lions and the owls stay
The powers that be even offered up reprieves
Told us they ain't take us out if we bow to our knees
But they can give that to the kings and the queens
And the worshipers of idols and followers of things
'Cause I would rather be in the jungle with the savages
It's kill or be killed, and I'm working with the averages
My professor emeritus
Say we been cursed being brought to the AmeriKKKas
How you raise a whole human single parent
No marriages, no sense of heritage?
Planned Parenthood helping plan miscarriages
But I'm lucky mommy already had a narrative
Product of a teenage love, my arrogance
Derives from the pride in the job my parents did
Named Mike, I was told it was godlike
Even danced with the devil, came out alright
Okay, honor y'all? No way
Still spell AmeriKKKa with the triple K
Word up to Spice 1 and O'Shea
And any MC peeping what I go through

We return from the depths of the badlands
With a gun and a knife in our waistband
Went to war with the Devil and Shaitan
He wore a bad toupee and a spray tan
So high now, hoping that I land
On a Thai stick, moving through Thailand
On the radio, heard a plane hijack
Government did that like they cooked crack
I move in a world of conspiracies
Obey no rules, I'm doing me
Smoke kush, transport to the airport
Customs found a joint in my passport
Pulled cash and I gave him what he asked for
Goddammit, it's a motherfucking miracle
Small bribe, made it back into America
Hit Uber and maneuvered out the area
Rhyme animal, pit bull terrier
Rap terrorist, terrorize, tear it up
Brought gas and the matches to flare it up

On any ally or rival
Born Black, that's dead on arrival

Beware of horses
I mean a horse is a horse of course, but who rides is important
Sitting high with a uniform, barking orders, demanding order
And I'm scared that I talk too much about what I think's going on
I got a way with this, they might drag me away for this
Put me in a cage for this, I might pay for this
I just say what I want like I'm made for this
But I'm just afraid some days I might be wrong
Maybe that's why me and Mike get along
Hey, not from the same part of town, but we both hear the same sound coming
Woo! And it sounds like war
Woo! And it breaks our hearts
When I started this band, didn't have no plans, didn't see no arc
Just run with the craft, have a couple laughs
Make a buck and dash, yeah
Get a little dap like ""Yeah I'm the fucking man!"", yeah
Maybe give a little back like, ""Here, I do what I can""
It's all jokes and smoke 'till the truth start schemin'
Can't contain the disdain for y'all demons
You talk clean and bomb hospitals
So I speak with the foulest mouth possible
And I drink like a Vulcan losing all faith in the logical
I will not be confused for docile
I'm free, motherfuckers, I'm hostile

Choose the lesser of the evil people, and the devil still gon' win
It could all be over tomorrow, kill our masters and start again
But we know we all afraid, so we just simply cry and march again
At the Dem Conven my heart broke apart when I seen them march mommas in
As I rap this verse right now, got tears flowing down my chocolate chin
Told the truth and I've been punished for it, must be a masochist 'cause I done it again
""Ooh, Mike said 'uterus'""
They acting like Mike said, ""You a bitch""
To every writer who wrote it, misquoted it
Mike says, ""You a bitch, you a bitch, you a bitch""
Add a ""nigga"" for the black writer that started that sewer shit
I maneuver through manure like a slumdog millionaire
El-P told me, ""Fuck them devils, Mike, we gon' be millionaires""
I respond with a heavy ""Yeah""
Big bruh says ""Fuck that, toughen up
Stay ready, write raw raps, shit rugged rough""
The devil don't sleep, us either
El spits fire, I spit ether
We the gladiators that oppose all Caesars
Coming soon on a new world tour
Probably play the score for the World War
At the apocalypse, play the encore
Turn around, see El, and I smile
Hell coming, and we got about a mile
Until it's over I remain hostile

Mere mortals, the Gods coming so miss me with the whoopty-whoop
You take the devil for God, look how he doin' you
I'm Jack Johnson, I beat a slave catcher snaggletooth
I'm Tiger Flowers with a higher power, hallelu'
Life'll get so bad it feel like God mad at you
But that's a feeling, baby, ever lose I refuse
I disabuse these foolish fools of they foolish views
I heard the revolution coming, you should spread the news
Garvey mind, Tyson punch, this is bad news
So feel me, follow me
Devil done got on top of me
Bad times got a monopoly
Give up, I did the opposite
Pitch perfect, did it properly
Owner killed by his property

This life'll stress you like Orson Welles on the radio
War after war of the world'll make all your saneness go
And these invaders from Earth're twerkin' on graves you know
Can't wait to load up the silos and make your babies glow
It's so abusive you'll beg somebody to roofie you
They'll snatch your hope up and use it like it's a hula-hoop
And it's a loop, they talk to you just like their rulers do
These fuckin' fools have forgotten just who been foolin' who
Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-
Kill your masters

Killer children of men on the throne, roving with no atonement
Got me feeling like I'm Clive Owen rowing through a future frozen
The flow's a burning wind, blowing to your coast
Now in cages 'cause we rode the waves of your explosions
Done appealing to our killers, man, to stop the bleedin'
This song's a dirty bomb for they dirty dealings
Boots on the roof, I'm Charley Mingus dumping through the ceiling
Master P-in' on these lost Europeans thievin'
Shit be grim, and De La born a reaper
Born in the beast and fixin' feast tearin' its features
The world surges, the nation's nervous
The crowds awaken, they can't disperse us
We ain't at your service
Won't stay sedated
Won't state our numbers for names and
Remaining faceless
We dignified, they can't erase us
We ain't asleep, we rope-a-dope through the flames
Man, the world gonna ride on what's implied in the name
Run 'em

Kill your, kill- kill your kill your, kill-
Kill your, kill- kill- kill your, kill-

I'm gonna bang this bitch the fuck out!
You better–you might wanna record the other way
You finna look at history bein' made in this motherfucker
Put a mirror on the goddamn screen!
Let's go, El-P!
Huh? Champ! So what we gonna do Mick?

I'm up at midnight, I'm dippin' off in my Nizzikes
A gun and a metal pizzipe, a knizzife is to my rizzight
I'm lurkin' servin' on pussies who lack a purpose
I've got 'em filled up with frizzight like, ""Mizzike is you all rizzight?""
I'm lookin' lurkin' on bitches twerkin' for service
The bitches bag is a Birkin, I'm yellin' screamin' and cursin'
I'm puttin' pistols in faces at random places like
Bitch give it up or stand adjacent to Satan
Bad man chillin', the villains is here
No Jesuses here, I hear the demons in my ear
And I want it, I need it, see it, I take it
Never fake it, wrap you motherfuckers up, leave you naked
The jewel runners, top tag team for two summers
Live and let live, fuck you cuz cause that's a fool's honor
I'm walkin' totin' on two llamas
You niggas ass and trash and trash, fuck it, I'm too honest
So fuck you fuckboys forever, I hope I said it politely
And that's about the psyche of Jaime and Mikey
You meet another pair better - highly unlikely
And if I can't rap, then maggot fuck, then fight me
I live for the thrill of the kill, yes it excites me
You know your favorite rapper ain't shit and me, I might be
The closest representation of God you might see
Pay honors like your momma young sonna and take a right knee
The passion of Pac, the depth of Nas, circa nine three
Mix the mind of Brad Jordan and Chuck D and find me
I spit with the diction of Malcolm or say a Bun B
Prevail through Hell, so Satan get ye behind me

Maybe you should be careful when flippin' a stranger's switch
Like assumin' the war is won ain't a symptom of arrogance
When nothin' to lose a step up then everything's for the win
So we grin in the face of frauds and tell monsters to suck our dicks
I live to spit on your grave, my existence is to disgrace you
The kitten became a lion that look at your face like great food
That's why we got the people behind us
While other rappers are vaginas for the fame, the jewel runners will always stay rude
Motherfuck your permission, was never yours to begin with
And every bar of the bitch shit you spit is your fuckin' prison
I been here makin' raw shit and never asked to be lauded

I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence, eloquent as the President
Evident, it's with emphasis, I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip, I'ma chill so my man can rip
Little man against Hellion with the heart of a orphan
I got the words of a murderer and a eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds and keep an OZ in my pocket
We run the jewels in your town, a quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage, I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year
I said ""El-P didn't do it, so get the fuck outta here!""
You wanna hang? Bring your throat, I got stools and a rope
I'm a slang pope, haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new addition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome (Ay, El)
Ay, we the villains, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talkers meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on you, Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet, be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at her crib with your kids saying ""Fuck your fort, lil' nigga!""

Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat

If they refuse to run the jewels, we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth
Hey, me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap

How long before the hate that we hold
Lead us to another Holocaust?
Are we so deep in it that we can't end it?
Stop, hold, ever call it off
It's too clear, nuclear's too near
And the holders of the molotov
Say that ""Revolution's right here, right now""
And they ain't callin' off

Wake up, roll an eighth up
Throw a double finger with a fist
Here at the abyss
I will be your tour guide
It is war time, check your wrists (Ready, kids?)
Over to your right, shine a light
Got a bevy ready for the fight
I just wanna live, I don't wanna ever have to load a clip
Only hunt bliss
I am still a kid in my heart
But these motherfuckers sick
They don't give a shit, not at all
They don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot
Listen along
They don't want your love, shit is bugged
Motherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood
Love when you beg
Trust, I would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun

Run out under iridescent lights for our lives
I will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight
Wild for the night
Look into my eyes
I am standing at your side for the fight
Minds over might
Swear to God
They could barely even see the dog
They don't see the size of the fight

Wake up
Drink water
Smoke blunt
Clean, oil my Kalashnikov
Stockpile ten for me and friends in case shit get to poppin' off
The evening news givin' yous views
Telling you to pick your master for president
Been behind the curtain, seen the devil workin'
Came back with some evidence
I'm here to tell you don't let 'em tell you what's right wrong
Make love, smoke kush, try to laugh hard and live long
That's the antidote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me
Please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me up

Up, up, up
Up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

Seen the devil give a sermon in the church
Seen an angel dancing in the club
Tryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air
And blessed her with a hug
I done been down so many times
Walked on, like a dirty rug
And now that I made it, can't fake it
Gotta give me what I'm truly worthy of
(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)
And I don't know how much it really means to be right
(Means to be right, means to be right)
And what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life
(Peace in this life, peace in this life)
And it occurs to me that maybe we ain't even really seein' it right
Here in the dark
Hoping just to see a beam of the light
(Beam of the light, beam of the light)

Really fell out the lane with this shit
Man, print this shit: I'm a misfit
Got a style from the guts of the most irrational beast in the district
Born to the next-gen system
Slow water drip to the temple to live in a prison
When the walls don't appear to your vision
One floor down from that mall's that prison
Where shower stalls'll get all y'all missin'
Pardon me, I got half-wit vision
But fuck I know? I just crawled here, cap'n
Pass me the baton, the rest o' ya'll batten the hatches
In fact, better scram, I'm a bastard
On the lam in a hatchback blasting some rap shit
Trying not to slam into traffic
With my feet on the wheel and my hands
Through the moonroof laughing, let's crash this
See, the truth from the womb is a fool-proof plan
To be doomed while the damned do they dances
So I move through the room like an animal fooling a master
But I don't got love for the hand with the food
Matter fact, I am drooling at that shit
I don't only bite, but I'm rabid
Try to pet my fucking head again
And I'mma put a tooth through the flesh
Of the palm that you jack with
This city just screams black magic
And the threat to my heart got traction
Maybe should've never started this path
Every time I get a chance to advance, it's backwards
No thanks to my very own actions
Get a couple good drinks in the kid
I can flip on a friend, take a drug, fuck a chick that I shouldn't
Oh god, I am one of those mad men

Real shit, I came for the jewels
I'm the killer of kings and fools
I'm the reason the season for treason starts this evening
And this evening, the odds ain't even
People praying to the gods but the gods ain't even listening
Don't matter if you're Muslim, Hebrew, Christian
When death runs in the distance
There will be no 'mercy me's
There will be no reprieve for the thieves
There will be no respect for The Thrones
No master mastered these bones
Your idols all are my rivals, I rival all of your idols
I stand on towers like Eiffel, I rifle down all your idols
Niggas will perish in Paris, niggas is nothing but parrots
I write for the writers that write for the liars
That impress you and your parents
Is this real or another dimension?
Am I trippin' here in the kitchen?
Am I a victim of my convictions?
I feel my sanity slippin'
And I think I like the freedom
Cannibal, animal, rappers I eat 'em
Even in Dubai, I smoke like it's legal
Bitch so exotic, she rode on a zebra
Made in America, home of the eagle
Home of the anger, home of the evil
Do what I do for the good of my people
Holding my lane, smoke jane in a Regal
Trying not to walk crooked while this anchor's dropped
But I been out on them choppy waves and it's hard to say

It be feelin' like the life that I’m livin' man I don't control
Like every day I’m in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine’s the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask “Why you’re here?”
I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that’s what it is
He chimed “You got a dime?
I said “Man, I’m tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don’t lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife
Man, I ain’t got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
'cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son”
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said “Shut up”
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and
Put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk
And hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
'cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording

Astro, yeah

Sun is down, freezin' cold
That's how we already know, winter's here
My dawg would probably do it for a Louis belt
That's just all he know, he don't know nothin' else
I tried to show 'em, yeah
I tried to show 'em, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Goin' on you with the pick and roll
Young La Flame, he in sicko mode


(Woo) Made this here with all the ice on in the booth
At the gate outside, when they pull up, they get me loose
Yeah, Jump Out boys, that's Nike boys, hoppin' out coupes
This shit way too big, when we pull up, give me the loot (Gimme the loot!)
Was off the Remy, had a Papoose
Had to hit my old town to duck the news
Two-four hour lockdown, we made no moves
Now it's 4 AM and I'm back up poppin' with the crew
I just landed in, Chase B mixes pop like Jamba Juice
Different colored chains, think my jeweler really sellin' fruits
And they chokin', man, know the crackers wish it was a noose

To win the retreat, we all in too deep
Play-play-playin' for keeps, don't play us for weak

Yeah, this shit way too formal, y'all know I don't follow suit
Stacey Dash, most of these girls ain't got a clue
All of these hoes I made off records I produced
I might take all my exes and put 'em all in a group
Hit my eses, I need the bootch
'Bout to turn this function to Bonnaroo
Told her, ""Hop in, you comin' too""
In the 305, bitches treat me like I'm Uncle Luke
(Don't stop, pop that pussy!)
Had to slop the top off, it's just a roof, uh
She said, ""Where we goin'?"" I said, ""The moon""
We ain't even make it to the room
She thought it was the ocean, it's just the pool
Now I got her open, it's just the Goose
Who put this shit together? I'm the glue

Someone said
Shorty FaceTimed me out the blue
Someone said
Play-playin' for keeps
Someone said, mother****, someone said
Don't play us for weak

Yeah!
Astro, yeah, yeah
(Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up!)
Ayy, ayy

Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin', nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they countin' on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy Father, come save these niggas, I'm stylin' on 'em
Good Lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm drivin' too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them

Five hundred shoes for the drip, I invest ('Vest, mmm)

Now that I'm home, back off the road
We shut it down where it ain't so

Covered with angels that's watchin' my soul

This is the real action: the pot party, the trippers, the grasshoppers, the hip ones
All gathered in secrecy and flying high as a kite

Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Palm trees, oceans, fresh air, that can break your heart

Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)

Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike (Hm)
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five (Hm)
Delta and I ship it overnight (Hm)
Stop tryna be God Almighty (Hm)
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments (Ooh-ooh)
When you hustle, always make it fancy (Ooh-ooh)

Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I'm warning you, better not try to play God tonight
If I love her, I'ma pass on her
First rule of war, you find an act on her
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love, but want to really burn me

Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

Don't talk to the boy 'bout comparisons, shit
Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit
The weapons we got are some terrorist shit
Like TV producers we, grr, we airing this shit
She askin' for bread for her parents and shit
I told her I don't got no cash and she said she could wait on a rack, on some Arabic shit
I pull out a million and stare at the shit
My dick just got hard 'cause a wire just hit
My schedule is out, come spin us, for real
Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit

Give a fuck about all of that heritage shit

And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves
It's been a couple months
And Tina still ain't perm her fuckin' weave

Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement

Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand (Ayy)
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Gone, nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

Please don't leave me now

You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck? You not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one? Evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, but the walkin' depends
If you can’t understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good

I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect

Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled

Comparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
(Two, three, go)
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it (Uh)
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
(Two, three, go)

Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
(Two, three, go)
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone

Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
You might also like
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me

Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone

You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Keep)
You keep me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now (Gone, gone, gone)
Going away, and now I'm scarred for life

My love is gone (Gone), my love is gone (Gone)
My love is gone (It's gone), my love is gone

(My love is gone)
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
(My love is gone)
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga (Yeah)
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
(Want me do it over? Everything)
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul

Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again

(Got my eye)
I said go, go

Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Again, again
Again, again

La-la-la, la
La-la-la
Ah

Satan's gettin' jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferrin' us
Books on not givin' a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us (Bitch)
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead, I rap about fucking bitches and gettin' heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby (Ah)
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhymin' pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours (Umbrella)
I hate this, screamin', ""Fuck patience""
Got a nigga shakin' like the calmest, fucking Haitian (Ha-ha)
After chronic masturbation, askin' where Mary Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick (Hate dick)
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She runnin' 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose (On God)
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one (La, la)
Honey on that toppin' when I stuff you in my system (La, la)
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome (La, la)
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressin' pourin' out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler, The Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands (Bitch)
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's tryin' to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleadin' squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex Mix, she bleedin' from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirrin' ruckus, throwin' sets up, yeah (Wolf Gang)
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin (I hate you)
Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossin' the border (Arriba)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
'Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Angel's daughter (Fuck Mary)
I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starvin' Nigerian kids barfing (Blegh)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playin' leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, ""Yeah Bob, this nigga's sick""
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead (Skinhead) since India Arie (India Arie)
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said ""Fuck coke"" and now I'm snortin' Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket (Casket)
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out ""Fuck faggots""
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, ""Fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, ""Hi,"" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the ""Tron Cat"" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck

They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Um
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
She thinks you're getting cash, no, bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait, turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig​ger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned
(I'm just fucking around)

Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke

Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease, bitch!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down, I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare
On the same damn bus like, ""You're going to jail now""

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck? Bitch, suck dick
Motherfuck' you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I'm a CO

Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo

Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-

This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat
My father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves

Simple, but probably not, fuck em

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made ""Sarah"" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?105Embed",https://images.genius.com/4e9f66f62fdc9420b7b69482ae69c248.400x400x1.jpg

Bitch must think I'm a motherfucking dummy (To the left)
Because I dress bummy, bitch think I'm broke
Bitch, I ate one roach and I made a lot of money
Popping since Bastard, (manager) Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe
Yup, and a couple of them swallowed
Meet me halfway, bitch I'm going all-in
And I never pull back, shout-out to my nigga Taco

So, a couple fags threw a little hissfit
Came to Pitchfork with a couple Jada Pinkett signs
And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet (No homo, too soon)
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me
A year ago, I ain't have no hoopty
Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

I'm tripping balls, David Beckham
Would fall 'cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
(wait a minute)
It sounds like midgets in a Goddamn speaker
Any time you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the goddamn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure
And when the beat drop, have a goddamn seizure

Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck, I can't sing, whatever, look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana, but I had to pretend that I wasn't
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because

'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (For me, uh)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (No)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)

A six-year Difference, uh
Is a ten year Sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another Statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love
You might also like
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)

She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because

'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (Woo!)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God, yo)

When you're thirty-five, I'll be forty-one
And when I'm twenty-seven, you'll be twenty-one, yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run
'Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo, this is dumb, you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally, you're older than me, and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention ""hang"", I'm thinking 'bout a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds, um
But I found my wings, fuck
But you're too fucking young
I really like you
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
I don't know what to do
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)
It won't even matter, I'll be in the clear, haha
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young, ha

Boy, I know that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy, I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I'll exit and wait a while
Just say the word, girl
Can't you see the answers are all there?
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you, girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all, baby, it's just you and me
But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin’ hurts
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me

For your boy
I'm watching Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
Nigga

Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me, nigga, you not important
I'm focused (Two, three, four)
Bring in the horns

They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkins a faggot, please come and get me (Two, three, four)
Said I suckin' at your neck, like a hickey, boy, I'm sicky (Two, three, four)

And a terrorist? Goddamn it, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber (Two, three, four)
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nig​ger
I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat (Man...)

And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round

We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beast is loose (Two, three, four)
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes (Why, oh, why don't they like me? They don't like me, oh)
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more Section 8
And what we ate was the steaks, now our section is great (Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, don't they like me?)

Scarier than black people with ideas (Two, three, four)
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin' (Two, three, four)
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' (Yeah)
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me (Two, three, four)
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em (Two, three, four)
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me ""Are you still down?"" (Two, three, four)
Yeah, my nigga, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on (Two, three, four)
I know they told they white daughters, ""Don't bring home Jerome""

I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon (Ask the deacon)
It's funny, when you get extra money (Two, three, four)

I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny (Two, three, four)
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me (Woo) (Two, three, four)
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (Skrrt!)
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level (Two, three, four)
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God (Two, three, four)
He said, ""I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"", uh (Woo)

I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room

Been exhausted, I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers
Hold your fuckin' ponies, my homie

Middle finger blind, so it's fuck A-N-Y-one (Um)
Fuck, skate, and die son, a hundred ways to die, son
I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rollie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda, oh my goodness
Wayne, them bitches ugly, these niggas colder than Tommy buddy
Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel (Black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling (Two, three, four)
Boy, let's get a scrimmage and cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German, you bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow and get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was
Fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot, ugh! Son, you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus (That's too harsh)
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchini
