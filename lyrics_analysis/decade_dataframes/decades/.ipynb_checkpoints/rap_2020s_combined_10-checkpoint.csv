Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left, I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand-up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga

Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)

Lot of model bitches check for me
Nigga, don’t check for me 'less you got checks for me
I kept a stick like a hobo, no checkin' me
Way back when D-Lo had the spot in Trestletree
So many hoes, had to get a vasectomy
She left her body home and brought her neck to me
I did a walk-through, they sent a jet to me
Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee
One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though
I was with the OGs learnin' 'bout the glass bowl
Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro
Break yourself, leave his brains on the dashboard
I'm with Ced and Lil Baby (Yeah)
We got four choppers that’s full (21)
Way before rappin’, on God, I was trappin', sneakin’ my Glock in Lacura (On God)
I got my K from Osama Bin Laden, lil' nigga, he signed this shit (Straight up)
I'm 4L gang, if you reach for my chain, then a nigga gon' die in this bitch (On God)

Runnin' this shit, what the fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Skinny jeans stuffed with them hundreds, they poke out

I'm a real one, ain't running from nobody
Hellcat fast, you know that I show out
Ain't sparin' no bitch, give a fuck 'bout a blowout
If we wanna smoke with you, boy, you can't go out
Still gettin' money my label don't know 'bout
Court-side with the vibe with her toes out
Rich nigga, I come straight out the poor house
Trap goin' crazy right there by Morehouse
Dead end, me, Ced and more ahks
Bought a Benz, doubled back, bought a trap house
I'm with Savage in the 6 doin' donuts (Skrrt)
Youngins with me, they got fire, they gon' go nuts
Quarter-million in a baby blue Goyard
Buy it cash then I go in the motor

Crocodile wristband, 21 Dundee
Yo' bitch skate so fast to the dick

Made it from the bottom, I'm a star (21)
Playin' with the stick like a guitar (21)
Why you got a 12 car garage? (Why?)

Couldn't pay the light bill, it was dark (Yeah)

Lost a couple friends, I ain't even really mad though (On God)
I ain't even really mad though (21)
Hard to tell the real from fake
'Cause nowadays, they got masks on
Who gon' be around when the fame and the cash gone?
I lost all my friends countin' bands in a Lambo truck

Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin' (21, 21)
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy ass niggas, I ain’t on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digits

Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money

I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though
I can't fall in love with a stank ho
Lil' bitch I fell in love with the bank ho
And you know I love that good drank, ho

But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, ""Run it""
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts (facts)
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'

(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom
Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo'
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit
Can't change on my gang, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion, uh
Makin' sure my kids happy, yeah
They dependent on their daddy, yeah
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me

Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete

Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gang-bangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades, so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga, one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', ""Can you front me?""
My old ho sayin', ""Boy, you growed up""
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy-niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliantte, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub

Whoever it is moved in and put an automated gate up
Repainted brick walls atop which now cameras rotated
By eight, the place dark, one light burn later
Razor wire like a slinky
Rumor is parcel bomb took the secretary right eye and pinky
Evenings, he take a snifter of whisky on the veranda
I wonder what he's thinking
In the morning, the maid brings coffee from the kitchen
Some nights strange music plays, I lay in bed and listen
Downstairs I hear my mother breaking dishes, my father trippin'
It's been quite bad lately, high tension
Galvanized steel security fencin'
To get through the day, give myself a mission
Anything what get me out the house a blessin'
His bodyguard chews khat, spits black in the rhododendron
Blacked out Range rumble when he start the engine
Avocado tree hang over the property line
I watch from as high as I can climb
The dog looks up and whines, the hills are alive with land mines
I live in my mind
Not sure what I'm looking for, but I'll know when I find
My mother sent the gardener to look for me, but the sky is a great place to hide

Burn in the firmament, charbroiled, catch the hair
Black boy burned crisp, pursed black lips

Cracked mirrors flash rictus
Skin pulled tight to the skull, that's the sickness

Burnt offering in the desert
Shining city up on the hill, I burned it like Nebuchadnezzar
This world, hard to even take its measure
Three rooms filled with Incan treasure
Still strangled the king 'cause it's now or never
It's a freedom in admitting it's not gonna get better
Washing your hands of people you known forever
I'd be a liar if I feign surprise, a goat eats where it's tethered
Treat African proverbs like Vegas flyers, I float above the peasants
Too clever by half, halftime down twenty
I'm not that good at math, but common sense, I got plenty
(It's fuckin' over)
In person, these rappers' watches look temptin'
The chain say envy, but PTSD keep me countin', never spendin'
My accountant is a head full of bad memories and sad endings
It's all payment pending
I'm not concerned with generational wealth, that's its own curse
Anything you want on this cursed Earth
Probably better off gettin' it yourself, see what it's worth

The photograph of young Tutankhamun
Spaghetti links tangled like ramen
Everything behind the mask rotten
I tell people I keep it so you not forgotten, but that's cap
I thought pillars of salt, but she too smart for lookin' back
Mid-eighties in the rear-view of a gold Mercedes
Midday sun make the crocodiles lazy
Money phone pocket dial, run come save me
Sweet old ladies poisoning pigeons in the park
For a lark, make mine strychnine, life is a zipline in the dark
Spare me the Hallmark Karl Marx
I was in the Dollar Tree break-room playin' cards with quarters
Stop loss posters on the wall, brick and mortar

Real observant in split-second decisions
Quick to kill a merchant (brr)
Child of God, might stray away at times, though I'm still a servant (Blockworks)
In the hood with the hoodlums where the killers purgin'
Niggas workin' with the Agency, makin' me really nervous
In the hills so far, can't even get no service
Out of range, learned the tricks to the trade and all the inner workings (the ins and outs)
Dug down in my soul and did some soul searchin' (yeah)
All I found was a police report for a missin' person (uh)
Every time I pay the connect, make a bigger purchase
Tryna run this bag up, fuck buying them bitches purses (fuck that ho)
Mirror image of the block, I paint a picture perfect
Our father who art in heaven all a nigga worship (our father)
Movin' at a slow pace, I used to get discouraged
All gas, no brakes, never did reverse it (skrrt skrrt)
Freestylin' on that road, never did rehearse it
On the janky promoter's tour through the Chitlin' Circuit
Where we at?
Game time

Dre shot his uncle for beatin' his mom
Beat the case, started eleventh grade like nothin' was wrong
A few classmates made the news, police pursuits
Reg flew off the dirt bike like a carton of eggs
Came back stutterin' with a limp and a dent in his head
Beautiful dreams he said he had when he was dead, twice on the table
On the bright side, they only gave him house arrest once they seen he disabled (good lawyer!)
Some couldn't wait to kick they kids out
Others had to do it 'fore gangs shot up the house
Annie used to lock her little brother in his room and we'd fuck on the couch
Doggie; she didn't like to kiss on the mouth
Switched schools, the rumors was gettin' loud
Men hate women, make up lies and spread 'em around
I grew up on the line 'tween north and south
I-95, two airports, triangular trade routes
E'rything we say mispronounced, flipped and bounced
Use the wrong word on the phone? SIM cards are switchin' out
Superstitious, cut my face out the pictures
Apartment complex a speed bump for the stick-ups
E'rything smooth but the gun just hiccuped

Waves on wharves, war washed the poor
Never broke again, what he said on the farm
Next day they was gone
Back by nightfall, they swung in the maw
Hung by daylight, the day was long
Sweep water out with the dipper
Salt in the mouth of a river
Mangrove thickets, man's soul was broken mirrors
False witness, wolf tickets
Nowadays scavengers come before the wolf's finished
Teeth bare, bristlin', they not scared, somethin' different
The huts was empty, coal still warm in the kitchen
Cannibal tours, they came on all fours
Waterborne, eyes like Jaws
Bones litter the beach, gnawed
Cracked meat out the beast's claws
Cannibal tours, they came on all fours
Waterborne, eyes like Jaws
Bones litter the beach, gnawed
Cracked meat right out the beast's claws
Drums in the hills like sunset
The gun turret swing right to left
African Queen on the ships deck
Shipwrecked Europeans swimmin' with the virus
Shot out like God's semen
""Fuck the world"" Pac's screamin'
Crack missions for the heathens
Boats listing from the stealings
Smoke drifting from holes in the ceilings
The swollen chiefs sit, bickering while the meat crisp
The chiefs eat children, the grease drip, the meat rich
Down here it's just a muddy creek, bend and twist, the braai hiss

The future isn't flying cars, it's Rachel Dolezal absolved
It's autonomous computers sendin' shooters back in time at the behest of defunct message boards

Black soap, crack, choke under masonic sword
From where they tax hold two thousand dollar reward
Found on the road, dead, pulling cotton from thorns

Travel Fox, wouldn't step in blood, wouldn't 
Bend the bitch one-eighty, what she asked for

Mogambo, the new world in motion picture entertainment
Mogambo, unforgettable adventure in untamed Africa
Africa, known for centuries as the white man's graveyard
The heat and fury of the jungle tears
The veneer of civilization from these women
No holds are barred as they fall in love with a man who lives for adventure

Facing existential threats, my advice, kill ‘em dead
No regrets, the devil’s rejects writ large
Observe the precepts of a benevolent god
Blue-eyed Prometheans in the heart of darkness.
Land of the monsters. Walk like Quetzalcoatl amongst the conquered
Dick hard
Put myself in the stars, his woman in the dirt
Face down, ass up, doing God’s work
Go native, the world is yours. (It’s mine, it’s mine, it’s mine)
The sound of Maxim's gun still sends a chill up my spine
Empire of the Sun, never sets
A Christian’s duty is never done
You can bet on significant returns to all shareholders
King Solomon's mines, just give me a hundred experienced soldiers
The knowledge of good and evil, sweet nothings whispered by cobras
Useless baubles given to greedy chiefs
Lies told with the practiced ease of an old thief
When they hung the poor nigga, I felt a certain relief

With that holy trinity, who can argue my divinity under two red suns
Return like Kipling’s dead son, summoned by monkey paw
A thousand Philistines slain with a donkey’s jaw
Gave them the rule of law, schools, roads, jobs, clothed and shod
Still, they fled to the land of Nod

Empire fat like a cow, slaughtered for the feast
The stink of a Jackal’s teeth
The gears of war get greased, ground 'em down to raw meat
Whites of the eyes, limpet mines

Hair and nails still growing, Dr. Livingstone I presume
Blood River still flowing
The forest inexorably growing as Kinshasa crumbles
The dreams of Romans drowned out by Nyiragongo's rumble

That's what they said when she saw him dead in the road
Now I know it was the shadow of them black wings
Unmarked followed us for ten blocks
Nigga said if they try to make the stop, I'm fleein'
Brake lights bright red, lit his face like a demon
We took a left, they went straight, we all laughed but I seen it
Some had the trap in the trunk of the bimmer
Some kept thе cracks up front so they could eat 'em
Somе went through the windshield, some went to the precinct
Some got yapped out driver's seats in parking lots and left bleedin'
Some things only make sense in their time
I paid a hundred for the whip, so when police took it, I never paid no never mind
Easy come

From Mandeville to Sligoville, coffin runnin' around
Upsettin', upsettin', upsettin' the town

Granny on the stoop, she never waved back
High grass, four flats forward with the front passenger door mismatched
Blacked out truck with the rifle rack
The hunter checks his traps
Bait car with the kill switch
Gingerbread house full of abused kids
Inflatable sky dancer said ""No money down""
Every sign said, ""If you lived here, you'd be home now""

Asleep at the wheel
Gently over the guardrail, flipped heads or tails

Intoxicatin', let's not ruin it with sex

Kush cake like LASIK
Resting bitch face, breastplate, Wonder Woman bracelets
You can shoot arrows all day kid
Hearts scrawled in wet pavement
Ozymandias is the wavelength
Here today, gone tomorrow, sorrow
White rum in my sorrel
Somethin' old, somethin' new, somethin' borrowed
Blew his stack on oysters piled like Kilimanjaro
Crostini, charred avocado, draped in lardo
Still got no quarrel with thеm Viet Congs
Speak sepia tonеs, everyone I know is gone
No stigmata, they put nails through arms
Temple Grandin, keep the cattle calm
Side-saddle, took Carrie to the prom
Joanne Chesimard, windows open, nights warm
Power cuts, no ice, so the cuba libre's strong
Fire in the cane fields, generational trauma
At the museum, eyes glassy from the pain pills
Me and her in the diorama

32 bars on how to rob and kill your neighbors
Still got the nerve to ask God to save you
The exhale got a whole different flavor
Official policy: don't do me no favors
Oakland Raiders, empire in decline, but still got plenty paper
Penny wise, pound foolish
Bring the mountain to Mohammed, move pounds stupid
A capellas, the beast chopped it and looped it
Threw some minor keys, bars, and hooks
Only option, cop the plea, it's off the books
This year
Sync the rapping up, the (w)rapping's off, I can hear
You rapping soft, no heart, defibrillate these niggas (Clear!)
Problem with the army is, they wanna be the boss
Problem with secret police is, it's like a dirty gun you can't toss
President Banana, lips burnt on roaches of bammer
Bad idea, like borrowing money in the slammer
Less than candid on camera
When you hit the big screen don't let whitey Space Jam ya
Sea of Green under rays gamma
Stunner shades, Ray Banner
You will like me when I'm angry

Cold fryer full of old grease
You don't work, you don't eat
The wind didn't blow for a week
Birds fly east searchin' for green
Open beaks in the nest, money machines
Flutterin', flags, covetous hags
It's not really movin' if it's not movin' fast
Mouth full of glass
Mouth full of glass
Water like a mirror, cut the gas with precision scissors
Bent to the task as if gravedigger
When it was slow cut each other's hair with clippers
Bullets cuttin' through dead air lookin' for victims
Vickers, VSM stamped on the ammunition
That's unusual though
Usually you sit there, the sun come and go
The moon float, horses thrown overboard kick fast, then slow
It don't really mattеr which
Thick mist, piff smoke, draw straws from clenched fists
Sinkin' ship, human souls in thе hull
He got the whole world in his hands, ice cold
Open them palms up, turned black as a ghost

Money went same as it came
Money spent, it was all pocket change
End of the day, day-traders make minimum wage
Pennies on the dollar once it's all said and paid
Penny stocks, stocking cap pulled over the face
Out of habit, the presidents facing the same way
Somebody made a killing, I just dug the grave
Capital gains, and gains (And gains, and gains)
Skim the indictment for old code names
Little Sambo grinning on a can of pomade
Dueling banjos open the stock exchange
Paper chasing, it hard to stay on thе same page (It is)
""No hard feelings"" the turn of phrasе, Twain adapted for the stage
A lifetime in the game, now the league folding
Contracts voided, Mohamed Atta, fly in the ointment
It's hot on these streets monsieur, I might shoot a Arab
If it's hot on the beach the plug just jet to Paris

One in a million makes a killing off the curb
Nine ninety-nine thousand, nine ninety-nine in the dirt
A sign above my head to count how many patrons served
Every time the number flips somebody get what they deserve
God is watching but I guess he got a lot of cheeks to turn
Ain't no shoulder colder once the fire die from bridges burned
Keep your mind off what is mine or you'll be smilin' on a shirt
It ain't ever over 'cause the fat lady forgot the word
Rain or sleet or famine and disease, I'm in the streets steppin'
With a reason, somebody deceased dangling from each necklace
Stuck inside the belly of the beast, she forty weeks pregnant
Might pull out the hammer, hit your knees and check your reflexes
Feeling like a million bucks - all twenties
And all I got is time and I heard that this shit's money
So you can count on me if you ain't in a big hurry
If you got mouths to feed I'ma make sure they stay hungry
God bless the child that took yours and got away with it
Won't testify if he caught and holla, ""They did it""

Swimmin' in palm oil out here

King of all blacks, I eat human hearts
I let things fall apart, motorcars rustin' in the garage
Granadillas wild in the yard, vines climbin' burglar bars
The roof fell in, on God, it's full of stars
I swam in the dark, sun fled, the moon large
Fire leap from Perry's Black Ark
Slash and burn, the past is never far
Reaching with chopped arms, lopped hands, no spare parts
The band played ""Those Were the Days,"" I watched 'em hang
I ate red red in the stadium stands
From crumbling balustrades, I watched 'em dance
Like drill rappers

You have your price
It's rather high
How high?
Gallows high

They grew fat in famine
Our mortarless fortresses lie abandoned
Alien monoliths still standin', pantin'
Super Ape, put a candle in a skull for a lantern
Light a dutch in Haarlem, Amsterdam, steps of a mansion
Speaking Afrikaans, British accent, I want mine from back when

No point going back and forth over who did what

I lied 'cause I loved her, I never crossed my heart
Showed my face, but left right when it started to start
A man apart, drink alone, packed bar
A stack'll turn a stan to your man at arms
A little gas, crash dummies flying out the cars

He lied to her anyway and toasted that night over pounds
Sterling, whispers in whirlwinds
Polaroid pictures, edges curling
At the auction
The contents of one storage space, sight unseen, going once
Sixteen, seventeen, cracking Philly Blunts
Half the smarts, but twice the heart
Look at the picture, eyes had a spark
Sputtering, at the bar mutterin'
Money comes and goes
Broke today, but tomorrow who knows?
Ten years ago she was just some hoe
Five years after that, I'm in love
And if you asked me today, I could give a fuck
Go figure

Ahhhhh

Sorry I ain't make the wake, yeah I know
A dollar short and 24 hours late
Trying to live my whole life in '98
Your moms watchin' me clean my plate
But there ain't no seconds
I'm at the ATM emptying my checking
I'm eleven years old firing a weapon
Dad's hand on my shoulder, smoke in my nose
Got older, went from chocolate to dro
Now if it ain't flight, it's a no go
Bigger, Faster, Stronger
I seen old friends start working with the po-po
Just goes to show
I could go back tell myself everything I know
But me at 23 would probably shrug a shoulder
Put stoge to fire like you're preaching to the choir
V-Mega was spitting through the wire
Like, don't even wet that
It ain't about no get-back
We doing digits on Route 90
Late for your wedding
Sitting in the morning sun with that good Otis Redding

Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else

You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?

In the same league, but we don't ball the same

Okay, made a million off a dinner fork, watch me switch it up
Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""
You need that work, I got that work, got bitches in my condo
Just bought a shirt that cost a Mercedes-Benz car note
From the A to Toronto, we let the metal go off

Damon Wayans, homie don't play that shit
I get paid a lot, you get paid a bit
And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""
Cashing checks and I’m bigging up my chest
Y'all keep talking ‘bout who next, but I’m about as big as it gets
I swear y'all just wasting y'all breath
I’m the light skinned Keith Sweat, I'ma make it last forever
It’s not your turn 'cause I ain't done yet

And still waking up like the rent's due
Not complicated, it's simple
I got sexy ladies, a whole Benz-full
And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it
If it's one thing, I am worth it
Niggas still hating but it ain't working
Lil' bitch...
Oh me, oh me, oh my
I think I done fucked too many women from the 305
'Fore the end of this year
I'll do King of Diamonds 3 more times
Smoking on that kush all in our section

Girl, you can't always have your way
Sometimes it be like that
They don't really fuck with you like that
They ain't never did me like that
I just took my time, you got the shine
I let you eat like that
I been taught to never loan somebody
What you need right back
And I need that shit right back

Niggas been stressed than a muhfucka
Niggas getting nervous
Clutching they chests like a muhfucka
Damn that’s a motherfucker
Tell the truth, I don’t listen to you
'Cause I don’t like being lied to
And that ship won’t sail
And that wind won’t guide you

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
You might also like
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G

How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it; if I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up (Lay up)

Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit

All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it

The other night Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog

Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach, but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us

I told 'em, ""Less is more, nigga, it's plenty of us""

Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uh
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah, we got it, bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel

Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg

Wine or water?
Did you say something about a cold drink? I don't know
I'm delirious

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know he's not around, oh, oh
You might also like
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me

Uh, cups of the XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flight's in the morning
What you doin' that's so important?
I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know he's not around
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious of makin' monsters
Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just callin' 'cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in there mixed up
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry
Are you drunk right now?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
Tell me, have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin' you could do better
And I'll start hatin' only if you make me
You not gon' come?
I guess I'm 'bout to just kick it here then

Just throw up while I hold your hair back
Her white friend said, ""You niggas crazy,"" I hope no one heard that
Yeah, I hope no one heard that
'Cause if they did, we gon' be in some trouble, yeah
If they did, we gon' be in some trouble, trouble, oh270Embed",https://images.genius.com/b428ba956c42c7e1bb1d56e729702724.486x486x1.png

Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
You might also like
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah

This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage

Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot

Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?

I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love

Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave

Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

Love is a drug, like the strongest stuff ever and
Fuck it, I'm on one, you feel me?
She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""

Cole
Cole world
Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…

And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
I ain't never did this before, no

And I ain't never did this before, no

Yeah, you know that feelin' when you
Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile
You might also like
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away (Oh, I), run run away, run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (Well, alright)
Run run away, run run away (Oh, I), run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Show 'em that your color is black (Well, alright)

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man, what you want, what you want?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit, huh
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit, but not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club, getting dubs
With a bad bitch in his ear, sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

Damned if I do, shit, damned if I don't
I'm passing up on bad hoes
Trying to be the man that she want, what she want?
What she—What she want from a nigga?
To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing, I suppose
And she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows
And deep down, she knows, she knows
And I know she knows, and I know she knows

Well, alright, oh, I, oh, I-I-I

Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you (Feeling you)

And life can't be no fairy tale, no once upon a time

Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?

Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn, she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show, I love her just like I love you, and
I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever

Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please

I see you, nigga, this ain't no Rolex, it's an AP, nigga
I'm hot, dog, catch up to me, nigga— huh, couldn't resist
Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, ""Thanks for the view,"" waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist

She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom, nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt (Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
(Who's the king?)
You tell me you still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know (Who's the king?)
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it (Yeah)
Listen, history repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang, nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?
We all kings (We all kings, nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game (Hehehaha)
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it (True)
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a bang, the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gon' be no more kings (Ain't gon' be no more kings)
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power (Mm)
In reality he's a coward (Mm)
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side (The other side, ayy)
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I (Yessir)
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God, nigga)
It's for all the kings (Uh)

(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

Hey, niggas be dyin' on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothin' but a criminal
Control the block, servin' up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they lettin' off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no comin' back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressin' me
Like I ain't the one who put them Js on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screamin', ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wipin' toilets
But these felonies be makin' life the hardest
Resistin' the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike, and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

You prolly grown now, so this song'll hit you
If you hearin' this, unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you
In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me prayin' that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writin' this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizin' in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushin' paraphernalia
But daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin'
Blood was stainin' the concrete
Older niggas I loved, talked like they was above
Maintainin' a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business, by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinkin':
""What the fuck we namin' this girl?""
I told her, ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of (Most prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen)
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm livin' fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catchin' up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand)
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand)
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger-happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blastin' frustrated 'cause the cash runnin' out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time duckin' school, duckin' cops
Duckin' rules, huggin' blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doin' time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearin' 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feelin' your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listenin' now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teachin' you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feelin'
What he'd been dealin' with lately, he wasn't tellin'
I tried to pick his brains, still, he wasn't revealin'
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chillin', he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothin', when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, beggin' you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleepin' at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? Fuck is you gettin' at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been havin' premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feelin' I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm livin' on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leavin' you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, makin' sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy, twelve years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from baggin' up them grams to servin' O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you

How I grew up, only few would've loved
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin', it's numbin' the pain
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a fuck and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this shit daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lack-sical-daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he actin' so crazy
He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a fuck if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', ""What have you done lately?""
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me

33 years, damn, I'm grateful I survived
We wasn't s'posed to get past 25
Joke's on you motherfucker, we alive
All these niggas popping now is young
Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop

Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Even when your plaques hang on a wall

Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns

Uh

Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me, my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees, my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need, my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see, my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?
Last night I had a bad dream (Bad dream, bad dream)
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? (Bad thing, bad thing)
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Fuck with me, my nigga
We gon' circle 'round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some trees, my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see, my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key, my nigga
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to, nigga
Me, I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too, nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do, nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
It'll haunt you, nigga, haunt you
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things? (What's the value of a thing?)

Father forgive me for my childish ways
I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now
Whatever goes up surely must come down
And you'll get your piece, but know peace won't be found

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, ""baby, don't yell""
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death

I grew up, a fucking screw up, tie my shoe up
Wish they was newer, damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now, I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm tryna stay alive, in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? (La la la)

I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way
My nigga  slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peeped game, got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard, pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her, ""Hello"", and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, ""What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on,"" he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing, his demeanor said more
He told me, ""Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be, that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You 'bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us, why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice
Money can’t buy you love, 'cause it’s overpriced

Son of a god, son of a bitch
Son of woman and man, son of a son, in a sunken abyss
Summon a plan, please come with a script
Cover my back, cover man, please come with the blitz
Look at the stats, JID like a magician
Fuck that, this some real ass shit, I paid blood for this
Taking cheese from the government
Cereal boxes with the bugs in it
Hand me down, this my brother brother's shit
Don't compare me to no other other niggas
In the city, boy, they say they fucking with you
Heebie jeebie, that's a bit disgusting, but I get it
I'm full of tension, full of spirit but full of shit
Standing next to Lil Tay when that bullet hit him
Shit, I miss him, I wish that that bullet missed him but it didn't
And since I been living with it like a sickness
Intimate, infinite rhymes, give me the baton
A ticking, ticking time bomb, takin' the finish line
Look alive, look in my eyes, look at you niggas tryin'
And ya dumb, dumb, better run, run 'cause we fryin' em
Eastside, where ya from, from niggas wildin'
So be silent before my niggas creep silent
With street knowledge, complete nonsense
Delete comments, online, all lies, we see violence
Every day in my eyes, they killing my niggas, die, nigga die
Pull up with the fye, get 'em, nigga, it's eye for an eye
If we gotta ride, fuck it, nigga, ride for the ride of ya life
Diabolical minds, I don't mind it, I like it, I like it, I love it
I fuck with you, you a thug, I'ma thug with you
We can knuck, we can buck if a nigga fuck with you
I got love for you out the mud with you, off the muscle

Okay, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, uh, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never askin', ""Give me this, give me that shit (Yeah, uh, yuh)
Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga…""
Again, never been shit, never had shit
Never knew shit, never out, (Woah) never do shit, (Woah) damn
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist
Never had shit, never take
Never askin', (Woah) ""Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, (Look) nigga, give me everything, nigga
Give me everything…""

Look, never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh
I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh
Most of the niggas I came up with– (Came up with) haven't came up
And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
Niggas thinkin' that they fuckin' with JID, y'all got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
""Oh, my God, don't be mean to me""
In the ride with a bean or three
And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch, take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in a way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king, ayy)
Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s (Yeah, uh)

Let's go
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, what?
Umm

Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan some'
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrr-rat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait (Yeah)
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticle
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo

I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
That it's too soon to for—

Push the fuckin' pack off of the porch or break a pound down
Get this strap, if it happen to blow, it make surround sounds
Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down (Oh, oh, woah)
Puttin' rap on my back, and I'm black and snatchin' crowns (Uh, woah, shit)

I done came back around
Like a nigga sellin' crack in pounds
I got a bag now, but it's nothing to brag 'bout
Gun blast in the background (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm a black man with the bloodhounds
MAC-10 makin' love sounds
To a bad chick, she from Uptown
I'm from down South, not a loudmouth (Can't you see?)
We can fuck around (Woah, shit, woah)
Hit the music, baby, cut it down (Woah, shit, woah)
Hit a doobie while you do me indubitably (Woah)
I feel like I'ma bust now (Woah, shit, woah)
I feel like a bust down (Woah, shit, woah)
When I shine bright, blind niggas is up now (Woah, shit, woah, shit)
In the cut, big black truck, pack sacked up (Woah, shit, woah, shit)

I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
That it's too soon to for—

Me and my money attached emotionally
I get to clutchin' if you get too close to me
I'm at the top where I'm 'posed to be
Jumped in the game, niggas act like they coaching me
Four hundred racks ain't shit but a show to me
I'm on the road and I bet that your ho with me
When I'm in traffic, it's always a pole wit' me
Pillsbury man, I keep dough with me (Can't you see?)
Hit from the back, she givin' me slurp, and I ain't even pull my pants down
Jump in the box and slide to the other side, it's always a man down
Draw down, hands in the air, nigga, make one move, get gunned down
Givin' out smoke so long, they don't even wanna talk no more, they just run now (Can't you see?)
No locked doors, I serve with a chop
Bitch got spent, she was hangin' with a opp
We call him Mickey, he talk to the cops
I was on Pinedale, glass in the sock
Back in the day, I invest in the block
Fast forward, now I'm investin' in stocks
I put a drum on the Heckler & Koch
Don't play 'cause I'm very invested in shots
Push the fuckin' pack off of the porch or break a pound down
Get this strap, if it happen to blow, it make surround sounds
Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down
Putting rap on my back, and I'm black and snatchin' crowns (Can't you see?)

I put the pussycat in his face 'cause he stay off Cheshire Bridge
Then I took it back, now he say that he shakin' and he shiverin'
Like the way it taste and he ain't ate it in a minute
They call me Yung Baby, but I still got hella chi—


Talk shit, run that motherfuckin' crown, you bitch
Motherfuckin' bitch
Hehehaha (Uh, shit)

Sorry in advance for my bros
They'll whoop a nigga ass, what you whippin' up? (Woah)

Niggas got it in the bag 'cause we trappin' on the low
And I'm the shit with the flow, huh
Give me a joke
Heard a nigga say that you the next? No, no, no
I'm the best, tell 'em bitches stop the motherfuckin' press
Press stop, fuck a top-five list, get 'em a vest
He get lopsided
Fuck the cops, we was runnin' from Rottweilers
Most of my partners ain't have poppa, just a popped condom
Couple kids with Alzheimer's
.40 on his side, boy, you Mike Alstott, he on the block violent
Robbin' niggas in the hood and then swap genres
Green light, line a nigga up, stop sign him
Keep drivin', you will not find him
I'm a, I'm a, I'm an, I'm an anomaly
I turned into a rapper ironically

Take your heart, don't let me break it in two
I'm sure that I could possibly do nothin' for you
I'm nearly on the edge, I'm 'bout to jump in a few
I'm really not afraid of nothin'

Look, on everything
I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs
That ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama called, ""Where the fuck you at?""
""On the road, and I ain't coming back
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
And that hundred racks bring a bundle back""
I was blowin' gas like the Honey Badger
J.I.D, bitch, the money snatcher
C'est la vie, shit, I'm coming after everybody
Don't get the bloody splatter
I'm fly and I got my niggas fly too
Shit is like buddy passes
I wanna cry 'cause I'm numb inside (Ugh)
If you wonder why, ask, ""What's the matter?"" (Yeah)

'Cause I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds

And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out? Heh
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house
Now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around
Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well, I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women
Wonder Woman working for it, if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
The difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
You got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil or off the temple
Pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning, you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously, you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead
I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds
Shit ain't really working out, shit ain't really working out

Comfortable, a basic bowl of shit
Hold my own, I own my dick
Go shalom, I’m unpredictable
And roll with the clique and fold with big clips
I know I'm feelin' activated when I came in this bitch
Claiming the 6, I don’t care about being famous and shit

Give it back to my fam, boy I am who I am

Pissed off, I done took my fifth loss this week
Big dog, I can scratch that shit off like fleas
I got a lotta shit to say, but I'ma keep my list short
I know alotta your favorites not gon' fuck with this part
When I'm done, please know that I was trying to diss y'all
'Cause if this is a competition, then I’m setting this bar
In my city, who’s with me? I'm in my own lane, jack
Niggas said JID so flame, I propane rap
I’m from East Atlanta like Gucci and Travis Porter
But my story is similar to the hare and the tortoise
Pen so sharp told stories you thought I forged it
Back in the fourth grade, never read Curious Jorge
My nigga Corey kept a little 40 inside his North Face
Left a nigga with no face and beat the court case
Coming home from ball practice, took the street the short way
We from the East, but never gave niggas a reason
To try it or think it's easy, soft pussy niggas eat the sorbet
Or eating your face, or squeeze the heat, then leaving your place
I've been telling you life's a bitch, but it’s a beach in your case
I've been yelling and throwing fits, I'm tired of screaming all day
I've been fighting these fucking demons all day
Man, this shit ain't never been easy, maybe I just need a breather
Hand your boy the blower, let me squeeze it
Blow a little steam, I ain't hating, I'm just heated
Niggas know what I mean, but niggas don't know what I been through
So if I offend you then, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
I heard niggas looking for a problem
But we don't even move until the rent due
My niggas' hands itching, finna rob something
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you (Our Father)
Better pray to God
Look, okay
Fuck what a nigga say or, look, my mama think I made it
Lift my head to the skies, I cry and begin prayer
Thanks to the maker, got me out of an awful place
My nigga gone for 17 years like a cicada
More than a motivator for me to get off my anus
And kick ass like I'm Danny Mainus
Put the pen pad to the paper, big mad with a painting brush
Splish splash, drawing scenes from my dim lit past
Dimwit, pimp shit, syndicate with the pen grip
Ripping shit, intimate, infinite rhyme kicking, l-l-let's begin
Who's your list? Your top 10? You can say whoever better than
I'm ready now, I was ready then, I was headed down the aisle
Rap game in a wedding gown, she gave me the ring
I said, ""Yes"" and vowed for forever now
On the honeymoon getting naked now
On a money pile doing doggystyle
I'm a father now, and you are my child
Or you aren't my child, I'm on Maury now
And I'm talking loud, the results are found
You are not the, wow, I should kill this bitch like a doggy pound
We divorcing now
I want the cars, ring, clothes, all the house
And you broke my heart, I'm re-organizing
And really trying to be mature about it
But I gotta kill it like a fucking villain
Dream-villain, Spill-villain, rhyme to the ceiling
Would I should I kill a rapper 'cause I coulda
Duh nigga, this a gun and a bullet
I heard niggas looking for a problem
But we don't even move till' the rent due
My niggas' hands itching, finna rob something

Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you

And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum

Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slept stupid

Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9—James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm a stallion, stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here
Okay, let's really make some noise in here

I'm under pressure, smoking pressure, walking in no direction
Chalk it up to the devil for fucking with my perspective
Too young to be a witness but old enough for the lessons
Soo Young, got a tucker to fuck with the chief inspector
I bleed just like your favorites, I shit just like the angels
Oh shit, I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin'
Like Lute, I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle
Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately, I've been blocked up
Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy, you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck

""Niggas ain't seein' you, Venus""—shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills—my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm peeping premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my deliverance
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up
So motherfuck a time limit, I'ma take what's mine, nigga
Ha—now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up
Now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""

Hasta luego, I'm finna break

All of my, all of my life
I been chasing a check and I never get it
Been around it, seen it, never had it
Mama, daddy, whole family, broke family
I'ma get it, told 'em I'll fuckin' handle it
And murder the game so the service candlelit
Emergency lane and I'm swerving, damaging the whip
But shit, fuck it, I'm fucking vanishing
Had to get out of Atlanta for a little minute
You know that there's madness in the fuckin' city
I thought it was love here
I thought I was good, I'm stuck in the mud here
I'm looking for drugs
I'm looking for big butts with the good hair
Or a ten-piece hot lemon pepper sprinkled
Fries crinkled, that's the lingo
If that's your girlfriend, she acting single
I caught the pass like I'm Ochocinco
I hit the gas down ocho cinco, like 85
It's like 8 or 9 'o clock, my nine cocked
If you on my guap, I won't stop 'til that boy go pop
They won't stop 'til they boy like Pac
They just pop 'til they brain fall out (Damn)
They never know what I be talking about
I only do it 'cause they never really talking about it
Bout it, bout it, turn the music louder, louder
How the fuck did anyone assume the God
The Son, the Son of God, the runnin' from the money
Bleed the blood just like the money, it's not Jumanji
I'm the doom that damned the dungeon
I'm the spoon that fed the hungry
Stand for something, fall for nothing, all or nothing
Y'all niggas balling, huh?
Just to find out that shit is all for nothing

Give me a break, what is you saying to 'em?
Give me the 'K, I'm finna spray the room
I'm finna spray the room (Shit, uh, okay)

Ok, everybody rich, everybody skraight, yeah, everybody ballin'
I never had shit, mind over matter, outside, I can't call it
All my niggas finna get a job, or they already got it
Couple trapping, couple catching bodies
Please don't come to East Atlanta, shawty
With your bullshit and your flex cap tryna' juug shit
Nah nigga, you'se a good lick, be a good guy, you a good kid
Never really understood this
But it's probably not for me to understand
I just played the cards I was fucking handed
And dealt with it like a fucking man
You my nigga then you my nigga then
Then we stick together like we Huck and Finn
We gon' get the chicken while we fucking hens
Don't let any nigga come fuck up the plan
If we gotta ride, well then, fuck it, then
If a nigga die, it got out of hand
If I touch the sky then my other guys
Recognize, must avenge
Jeopardize, I publicize, justified
When we busted in, were you terrified?
Was it televised when them rebel guys started busting heads
Over what a nigga said or do to JID?
These the crazy niggas that I grew up with
In the shady city that I grew up in
They ain't doin' shit, but they doin' shit
Hasta luego, I gotta get up away from here
Hoping that somebody pray for me
Telling you it'll mean everything
Everything you know what I mean
There's no working no emergency
I don't wanna be a burden, yeah
I just really hope you love a nigga when he's hurting

I tell 'em get out the way, I'm finna take it to 'em

My girl booty soft and it's shaped like a skrawberry
Her pussy bald with a tat like Stephon Marbury
Carry all my dirt to the grave, I'm the pallbearer
Bury all of my sins, staring out of the Benz
Gone off weed, gone off Hen', gone with the wind
Gone with the pretty long heiress with the fairest skin
Yelling in her face, and she repeat it like a parrot and
Apparently, she gone keep yelling at me, I'ma never win
Where your ass was at when I was sleeping on the couch
And in the whip?
Probably with another nigga, on another nigga dick
I'm on another tip, my skin so tint, strength on strength
One on ten against me, I won't break, I don't bend
Watch your statements, guard your chin
Guard your heart, guard your light
Find your zen, mind your lightness
You doing without cause you ain't looking within
But if you ever in doubt, give this a spin

Yeah, for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl, I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)

I mean shawty had relations that we never could speak about
You get mad, I'm mad, we sleep it out
And then she had a man who used to beat her
So she told me she wanted out
Got a couple abortions, now that pussy's a haunted house
Now her heart cold, Antartica, Siberia
Had it planned out, curriculum, criteria
Change, she feel pain, strain, built-up anger
From dealing with a dickhead, putting her life in danger
I understand, it's times that you go through your women things
And sometimes can't gauge clearly on what you be thinking
I swear I got your back and got the tab on what you drinking
You ain't gotta move a finger or pinky when we linking
Whatever keeps your boat afloat or ship sinking
From loose lips of side women stepping out of position
Breaking out of a system, prison
Parallelogram, shaping the prism, stop signs never stopped I
Let's be realistic, I been trying to get in touch with my senses
And be better to my sisters
But niggas think that you feminine when you sensitive
My homegirl rap, and she feminist
Hold it down for the women, I call her ""Feminem""
Tell 'em how you really feel headass
'Cause ass shots are dead ass and fake tits been around, we gas it
Girl, you perfect without that makeup or the plastic surgery
I'ma tell you how it is like Ron Burgundy
Yeah, for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl, I'm your soldier

Yeah, okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch (Yeah)
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth (Damn)

Get my girl angry and pissed and give that pussy a kiss (Damn)
Pushing the same piece of shit until I get me a Bentley
Same niggas, same goals, same dreams and epiphanies (Damn)
Me and my niggas are same lines as symmetry, wasn't empathy (Damn)
Remember we would front yard brawl with big Timothy? (Damn)
Kicked them doors because we had a lot of energy (Damn)
My brother was locked up for shooting at the enemy (Damn)
Caught one nigga then caught fifteen (Damn)
I ain't meet that nigga 'til I was fifteen (Damn)
Now I'm kicking 16's with a big screen in attempt to get the big cream (Damn)
Little guy with a big dream, I need guidance (Damn)
'Cause if I'on succeed, I probably proceed violence (Damn)
Sippin' on the brown, no Bobby, I don't fuck with nobody
No team and no posse, you can catch it like Shockey (Damn)

So part of the reason I be so hard on my people
We never had it easy, never had a pot to pee in
I be on my knees praying till my onomatopoeia's packing a coliseum
Ain't no parking, I gotta see J.I.D
Gotta be there for my family, I gotta, can't try to be
I could be out of my mind, thinking logically
No apologies for speaking how I feel, I silently swore solemnly
That I would be the guy to make my black people proud of me
Roses to the mothers of anybody that doubted me
Yo' chick want dick, bitch dove in the covers
Overseen my areas, surveyed over my brothers
You touch them, you kill me, you can't get close to none of us
They still double-dribble, we going for triple-doubles
Triple up on your investment fuckin' with us
Probably have to rock that vest shit, you fuckin' with us
Wait (Nah bro) Huh? (What you talkin' 'bout, homes?)

Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch (Damn)
The dopest dope you smoke gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth (Damn)
Okay but fuck that shit, I gotta get it, I gotta get 'em
Tired of picking these locks, you don't respect my existence
I used to sleep in my car, never a park or a bench
But damn a nigga was broke, damnit if I didn't get it
Them niggas was thinking that it was just a wrap for the kid
One day they gon' hit my phone, hit the show, scream, clap for the kid
Let's get it poppin', they're pulling pistols on Apostle Paul
So pay the piper or meet the sniper, legend of the fall
I knew in diapers you and I was nothing alike at all
I do or die, you do it to die, I'm really making calls
You couldn't kill it and take it out of me, the ideology
This the Odyssey, I'm Odysseus, you gotta follow me
Watch how I maneuver, I influence the influencers
The flow is like a fluent influenza going through the motion
So I motivate all of my niggas, they tell me kill 'em with kindness
I'd rather kill 'em and they other significants
Writing lyrics in the city with pretty booties and titties
Don't get the cooties, it ain't like the movies
It kinda is 'cause they're shooting, kind of shit is you moving?
Shit I'm pushing, empower the people life where I grew up
Someone tutored the students, these niggas stupidest, stupider, stupid shit
Sick as a bitch, flick of the wrist, my pen cleanse  my many sins
The irony the iron can't straighten out any wrinkle in existence
Ripple in time triple my eyes realistically sick in the mind
Sick in the head?
Wish I was dead, sick on a med, 'dicted
My lead sick 'em, give 'em, send 'em to hell, eh

Fuck a lighter, I could light on the stove
Dark at night, I'll drop a log on the fire
Wander in the woods out in the cold
I got the shit you could play for your mama
I got the shit you could play for the hoes
I got the shit you could sell to the trappers
In Decatur with the 'K and the Colt
I know some rappers that—how I'ma say this?
I know some rappers who paid but broke
Lotta money but you played your soul
You played yourself, you played the role
I know some niggas from down the street
Some of my niggas been down the road
Lost a nigga that was down with me
You know what they say, it rains, it pours

They got the people in office
Them crackers that had us in chains
They make the laws, they goin' hard
Dang, they even started a gang
How you gon' win in a losable game?
Make a change, man, niggas say the same thing
Every day, complain and the sun shine
And the cloud rain, but won't lift a finger
In the danger, niggas been endangered
Been indentured, now my niggas got business ventures
With my .9, I'm like ten Avengers
Snap a finger, I could end adventures
Rapper? Singer? No, killer, nigga
You a cop or you a nigga killer, woah

And, man, they won't understand, man (Fucked up)
And, man, they won't understand (Uh)
I live in harmony and peace
And the sun will once again rise up in the East (See)

Somebody told me when I was small
That the pride cometh right before the fall
God son died for us all
So for mine, I'm running through a wall
Lost a battle, it's still a war
I'ma steal the cattle, then burn the farm
We could travel but the journey long
I prefer we get a lil' murder on
Drop the top on your convertible
How we feelin' should concern you
We been speakin' but ain't never been heard
So now we screamin' at you word-for-word
Everything a nigga learned gotta burn
My lil' nigga in a hearse, I was hurt
Fuck a rap and fuck a verse, I could blur it
Tryna see how many urns I could earn
Are you entertained or are you concerned?
I'd be afraid, I'd be in church
I'd say a pray, I pray I say, I say I shade
They play like God, no play-by-play
We take our charge, we take our place
It'll take our hearts, it'll take our faith
But we need the majority to make shit shake
I'ma get me a quarter, I'ma get in a car
And I'ma get on a call and go state-by-state
And I'm picking the target then I'm picking them off
You better be Beyoncé if you say my name
Orange ambient sunlight and daylight savings
Might save a nigga's life
It ain't never too bright to broad day a nigga
Night time vampires and they'll slay a nigga
It's not like landslide so you can take their slide
I'm a canine straight in the pack lookin' for Jiddy, he's takin' it back
Crackin' a whip, whippin' the crack
Just like them crackers that did to the blacks
Just like they thought I was finished attacking
A beast awoken, I peel at the crackin'
They inferior and fear when I'm rappin'
But I ain't rappin, this is spiritual
Shed a tear so it'll curate when miracles happen, huh
Mirror, mirror, why the fuck is you laughing?
Dear, dear, let me volunteer 'cause I'm not in fear
I'ma jump in the ashes (Ooh)
Oh shit, ""It's getting weird""
Nah, shit is weird, what the hell is heaven on this hemisphere?
If them bitches sell it, I'ma end it here
If we come together we can send a message
But I know they never gonna land it here
So I got the method, one, do you better
Do you want better?
Bitch, you won't do it, let's bet I will
Collect my stones, ho, collect my gems
Protect my stronghold, respect my shield
Until I'm long gone but while I'm here
I can snap my fingers, they'll disappear (Boom)

And as I lay myself to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
The pressure makes me, the journey takes me
To places where history can't stop or break me
You know it rains for somethin', you know the pain's for somethin'
I hope a change is comin', just keep on swangin' on

Swang on, swang on (Oh), swang on, swang on

Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on
Swang on, swang on, swang on, swang on (Uh)

Keep on swangin' lil' sis, keep swangin' lil bro
I'm 'bout to swang on Terry Payne because he said my sister ho
Gettin' high from Swisher Sweets, chariots are swingin' low
Swastikas and the police, hang a nigga, swangin' rope
Peewee tried to swang on me, but I was with likе fifty folks and he ain't know
But what was worse, I don't evеn want no beef with bro
We was toted, we was soldiers, we was soulless
We was sold, they sayin' somethin' 'bout his set
Nigga, that who he swangin' for
Swear you bitches don't know shit about our stress, about our woes
And my obsession with success by definition of my own
Sure as death is waitin' on our flesh and bones
Demon callin' my spirit, had to click the phone
Couldn't get to Courtney quick enough to give her warm big hugs
Told her, ""You like the strongest woman on the fuckin' globe""
I watch my momma lose her momma
Go through drama and trauma but had to keep her head high
So we don't fuckin' know
I'm gettin' older, so when the world's feelin' enormous on your back and on your arms (Ooh)
And your feet just as heavy you been draggin' through the storm (Oh)
Starin' at the city, but you trapped inside a hole (Oh)
Get your back up off the ropes, keep swangin' on (Yeah)

Gotta bring it to you cowards, y'all wanted it
Cowards, and it's gonna be sicker than all the niggas–
Yeah, uh, look

You can tell a nigga like me ain't never had shit
R.I.P., I miss my dawgs like Mike Vick
Zombies in that midnight fog, them bars sick 'em
Fall victim to a gun brawl, started over some bitches, huh
Niggas trippin', they takin' whatever's given
The irony when a nigga's starvin', gotta grip the biscuit
Jump the fence, empty all the dishes out your kitchen
If you witness it, then click, click, click, and they spill the grits
Feel the kick, fuck a fair catch, kill 'em, who tryna take the hit?
First take go to first base, Stephen A. Smith Wess'
On the hip, talkin' shit like Skip
Or Shannon, sharp-shootin' off the top of the cliff
And if I gotta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be sick
Put in my ten thousand hours while the clock still ticks
Zone-6, five fingers with the ""Suck my dick""
Me and Izzy was slap-boxin', nigga bust my lip
Start fightin', lil' brother on some tough guy shit
But if you ever did me wrong, he on some ""What's right?"" shit
Bust a left, feel the pressure like the bus pipe drip
Blood red, rum sippin', they ain't cut like this, momma said

Seven crackhead bad kids in a caravan

Somebody involved in stealin', it's on, it wasn't
It's gon' be so bad
When the girl went off on Precious
The girl went off on Precious, Rosalyn went in
No, Rosalyn said, ""Oh, for real, I'll see you when you get outside""
Exactly, exactly
That's okay, my fault, my fault, my fault
For real? No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Look, uh

You can tell a nigga like me ain't met a nigga like me
Metaphysical things seen in dreams, what you believe?
You believe I bleed, then draw blood
I'm a fuckin' artiste, Artest with the gun
I can give my world peace, give your world ether
Big dick or grief, I can give your girl either
She could be the, could be the collapse of a kingdom
But king's gotta peep the seat, word to Caesar
Remind me to keep receipts, y'all shit weak
I ain't worried that that bullshit leaked
See the volumes, it speaks to your broke speakers
Niggas breakin' they back tryna promote some shit that ain't even dope
They ask for my coat when I walk through the door
God flow, I don't walk on the floor
God knows y'all hoes, y'all shows ain't packin' the door
Crackin' the floor, I don't even know if niggas rappin' no more, come on (Uh okay)
'Round in my city, I am my shooter
Mindin' my business, I am not you
'Round in my city, I am my shooter
Mindin' my business, I am not you
'Round in my city, I am my shooter
Mindin' my business, I am not you
'Round in my city, I am my shooter
Mindin' my business, how about you?

Look, uh, I do it for Royal and Rosalyn, Rachel and Carl
Izzy, Precious, Destin, strong seven kids, different blessings (Hey)
Izzy athletic as fuck, All-American star, hard head
Scholarship at a school in New Orleans
On the football shit, but in class, he on the smart shit (Hey)
Black man using his mind, it's a target on your forehead
Gotta stay on point like a marksman
Make a mark, leave a footprint, went for a marching
Bro graduating so we heading to the blue state
Fam' celebrating, granny cooking up a few cakes
Yeah, gown on with the cap like a toupee
Handed a diploma, all the Routes say, ""Hooray""
Yeah, hooray, today, catch a bouquet
Tonight it probably be a movie, what's a Blu-Ray?
I got some new Js and a fade, we hit the section
With the football team and a couple other professionals
It sound cool but really, this a confessional (Hey)
Twenty minutes in it, Precious and 'nem went to the restroom
Said they got to hittin' with some women and they 'bout to get kicked out
They ain't even tell us what that shit was about
All I really seen from the big VIP couch
Was a nigga swing, and hit my sister right in the mouth
The bouncer tried to block the door, that way we couldn't get out
But fuck that, the whole team bust that motherfucker down
Now we fighting in the street, it's like ten against twenty-three
I was seventeen, swinging on any and everything
Bing, bing, see my brother doing buddy like a boxing ring
Ros' got a bitch doing the hair weave sling
So beautiful, beating ass was like a family thing
Fighting together made us tighter in spite of how we would argue and scream
And now we brawling right outside of a party in New Orleans
And all the people start police-calling
Pack us inside of a paddy wagon, we sardines
To Saltine crackers that wanna shackle us in chains (Hey)
Lo and behold, they held us in a holding cell for six
Or maybe seven hours just to let us go without a stain
But who's to blame when all of us got the same mind frame?
We like a gang, mom and pop'll probably be proud and ashamed
Pound for pound, my sister Precious never lost a fade
Got up off the ground and she said she could hear my father sayin'
""When you fall down, stand up, get the bandage""
""I ain't got cheeseburger money, make a sandwich""
""Why you bein' bad? See ya dad, get your ass whipped""
Seven crackhead bad kids in a caravan, yeah

Hold on, hold on, hold on
What happened? What happened? What happened?
We came in the club
We're talking, we go in the restroom
I go in the bathroom, open the door
""Dang B, you could've said sorry""
Ros' said, ""B, you ain't gotta say all that, it ain't that serious""
And she was all, ""Oh, it's that serious because you were in the bathroom""
Ros' said, ""Okay B, I got you B, come outside""
Taj, she opened the door, Rosalyn said ""Roof""
I said, ""Okay, we fighting""
Damn, she was in the stall
Oh the stall door
Yeah, she was peeing, girl, she pulled her pants up
She opened the door and received it (Rosalyn met her)
Ayy, you know what?5Embed",https://images.genius.com/0833ddfa5a1d200227e80a3b1f88c16a.1000x1000x1.jpg

Cole, you stupid

Look, you told me never let this get a hold of me
You hate to see me hurt, you wanna hurt someone for me
Way too down to Earth, don't do no dirt for me, please
I don't need nobody else takin' a deal or a plea
God knowin' what I'm doin', he gon' deal with me
Niggas ain't cut like that, she'll kill for me
And I don't care if we don't speak for like a million weeks
You right there when I need you but I know these ain't your kind of people
I finally bought a home to raise my family
I'm done with all the hoes and they anatomiеs
I tried to call your phone again, you said, ""It wasn't on""
And by the timе you got my letter, I was long gone

Back on the road, gone with the wind blows
Packin' the shows, hoes and the nymphos, platinum and gold
You know how this shit go when family's gone
You don't know what you here for, uh

Just remember, remember who I am
Mommies, daughters, models, callers
Ballers, fathers, all have fallen
Mommies, daughters, models, callers
Ballers, fathers, all have fallen

Look, you said I shouldn't worry 'bout the fame
You seem to be concerned of what you heard about the game
'Cause soon as niggas get a little change, niggas change
And playin' with the Lord's name, sayin' it in vain
You heard this song and said I did the same thing
You seein' somethin' different in my eyes, and she emphasized
And I ain't get it at the time, I couldn't listen
Had to call her back, line packed, sold out tickets
I'm on the wrong track, road back, fuck it, I'm hittin' it
On the road, I'ma bulldoze the globe for the dough
She know she happy that we doin' better than before
As long as I'm sellin' shows, you ain't sellin' for your soul
I felt like she was yellin' like Azealia in that megaphone
Said, ""I'ma hit you in the mornin', keep your message on""
I did my set then sat alone for a second by myself
Asked questions, choices, destination, courses
Highways, routes, Royces rollin' voices
Goin' on and on and on, it's noisy
I'm not the only one affected by the poison in the mind
And the lifestyle that shine from the iced-out diamonds
That combine with misogynistic mindsets
Dialect from slave, diatribe, they tryna dissect to re-digest
I tossed that mindset overboard like an object
I'm tryna find a letter to the Lord from the projects
'Cause when I was a boy, I didn't know that we was poor
And now I'm on tour, I got a moment to explore
And show my niggas somethin' we ain't never seen before
Open doors, so you know I'm goin'
Back on the road, gone with the wind blows
Packin' the shows, hoes and the nymphos, platinum and gold
You know how this shit go when family's gone
You don't know what you here for, uh

Just remember, remember who I am
Mommies, daughters, models, callers
Ballers, fathers, all have fallen
Mommies, daughters, models, callers
Ballers, fathers, all have fallen

Why do I get so damn high that I can't feel my face?
Try and try to free my mind, but I can't find a way
Why do I get so damn high that I can't feel my face?
Try and try to free my mind, but I can't find a way

Look, I never gave that much a fuck about this shit
To let it challenge my integrity
But you questionin' me, got me thinkin' you thinkin' less of me
The lesson in this shit is we should talk face to face, fuck the messagin'
Meet me in the flesh and you can see that I'm still lil' Destin
Lil' brubbie, lil' BB, bald head as a baby in the Huggies
Stunt like my dad, I'm a druggie
Money in my hands but it's bloody
Try to understand if you love me, ayy
Make plans, we can roll like the old days
FaceTime call came with a stone-cold face
We don't talk often, when we do, it's an, ""Are you okay?""
Somebody fuckin' with you? I'm on the way
It's on the waist, I can tell the way you look, that ain't the case
Figured you was mad at me when you said you need a break from the family
And you not participatin' in no Pagan holiday gatherings
And ever since I start rappin', I ain't never in Atlanta too long
And I hate havin' to only see the family when somethin' bad happen
Like when Granny passed, I ain't wanna answer the phone
Writin' in my pad, hope I don't remember this wrong
Last time I seen you, we was sendin' her home
October, November, December was gone
But on the 25th, we gotta be there for mom
I'm talkin' to you now, but can I see you tomorrow?
I could be on the way soon as I finish this song
So you can see I'm still true in everything that I been doin'
And I don't fuck with the Devil but I know he pursuin'
And I know that Jesus died, thirty-three, like Ewing
And he prolly did the same shit that we like doin'
I know you got to feel the animosity brewin'
It's gettin' bad and I'm sad our relationship ruined over some trash, but it's past that
Send me all the money that I gave you over Cashapp back since you actin' as if you—
We're sorry, you have reached a number that is— (Aw)

And you ain't comin' back, give me back my hoodie

You really wanna act, bitch, we at the movies
I want my money back, I'm leavin' for goodie
And I get aggy, don't even wanna be here
And you get mad 'cause you don't even wanna leave here
And now it's bad 'cause we ain't even seen the previews
And now she mad, takin' shit to social media
And I just need you to tell me how you feelin'
And I just need you to come at me wit' real shit
Botherin' people 'cause we fightin' in the dark, yeah
We ain’t gotta leave but we gon' sit a seat apart (Yeah)
Uh, tears in the bucket of fuck-its
Fightin' and fuckin' and tusslin' and fightin' and fuckin'
Lovin', lovin' unless you lucky
I fuck wit' you because you real and you beautiful
But still, starin' at the screen only thinkin' how I feel
For real
I wanna share my popcorn wit' you
'Cause I won't eat the whole thing
But you still got an issue
And I been tryna sip yo' drink, meet the kid in the middle

Our offense is awesome, our defense dominate
We got that winning combination
To what? To regulate
Offense is awesome (Forever)
Yeah

2007, Cole dropped The Come Up
I was in high school playin' corner
I never dreamt of mumblin' words in front of hundreds
Studyin' plays all summer
I'll hit the league if my growth spurt come in, on my mom
2009, bro dropped The Warm Up
I was in warm-ups playin' Weezy
And Yukimi, Little Dragon, flame breathin' the weed
Patrick had the studio dorm room next to me
I freestyled ovеr his beats
My nigga Keese transferrеd in from Tennessee
He's a receiver, I played DB like Aqib
Snatch a nigga chain, Talib
Talib Kweli, I could be lyrically, but I put on cleats
Scribbled lines goin' through my mind like a paper piece
While I covered three, playin' nickel, doin' safety reads, watch the flats
I can rap, but I rather tackle and pedal back
Get a pick when my growth spurt hit (It don't matter 'bout the size, it's in here, man)
I'ma be captain, and I was around 2010, no cap
I got 'Freshman Player of the Year' and figured I was on track
This nigga Pat' been in my ear talkin' 'bout rhymin' on tracks
So after practice we record and then we got it on wax
And on campus I heard about a couple rappers from Atlanta (Earthgang!)
Said them niggas was snappin', maybe we could make somethin' happen and shit
I wasn't serious enough to even be curious
And we lose like every game, so every day I be furious
So, the spirit of a nigga had changed
To the point I had to reframe and focus my skills for other things
I took the steel wheel, I'm steerin' in other lanes
But my fuel on low and my oil need to be changed
Amongst all the other shit that's goin' in my brain
My brother got out of jail, I only know him by name
He did a nickel and a dime in time, probably be stayin' with my mom
And dad probably get mad, actin' lame some times
You might also like
Uh, look
The Sideline Story came out September of 2011
Ib said around that time:
We was huntin' for a record, under lots of pressure
Just combine the leverage with a better effort
You could find a sound to get us out the underground forever
Maybe you can bless a little brown effervescent kid
Youngest of seven from the six, eight sections
Section.80 dropped, yeah, we used to play that shit to death
And if I recollect correct, you tried to sign him for yourself
All the while I was round my out of  town college, wildin' out
Restaurants, Destin dinin', dashin', call it dinin' out
Fuckin' bitches, 'posed to be in class, but I was hiding out
My friends take a little shot, smoke a lot of cannabis, coolest nigga on the campus
Now a nigga skippin' practices, and actin' like a rock star
Going from in the dorm to in the car, leavin' the football field
But fuck that, we still sorry, and the problems from the home front
On my home screen callin' me, I don't wanna answer
My brother Carl hit me, said my granny had cancer
I'm 'posed to graduate and make my way back to Atlanta
No job, no money or nothin' from ballin'
Because between that and school, that was really all
And maybe here's the back that broke the camel with the straw
I wasn't on camera with them amateurs that they saw
But they said they still caught me and my dawgs stealin' boxes
Like Craig on his day off
Called us in the office day before we 'posed to walk, uh
Called a squad car, a couple officers
I know bro was finna tell, he was lookin' nauseous
Now I'm sittin' in a cell, nigga double crossed us
Crossed me off the list for scholarship because I lost it
No more football, my red-shirt senior season, exhausted, so I'm off it
And I'm right back in Atlanta with a half a gram of weed
And a gold Pontiac that my granny had bought for me
I was sleepin' in the back, my dad kicked me in the streets
When he saw my neck tatted, then I told him I was rappin'
Fuck school, no goin' back, he said
If I can not follow his rules, just go and pack
Told you he be actin' lame some times
This my son, he came from these nuts
This negro come back from school
All tatted up like the Sistine Chapel
Talkin' 'bout he ain't playin' football no more
Because he know he ain't goin' pro (Hey, it's a stamina that you left the house with)
But he left on a full scholarship to go to school and get a degree
Because we taught education was the number one thing
Anyway (Every one of you gon' be like your oldest brother)
He came back, determined to do what he was determined to do
And I know because he, he is, who he is, we taught him
Hey, whatever you do, put your full self into it
So he did that, anyway (Do it your best, damn what other people want)
He's back home, I ain't with that
So I'm sayin' ""Hey, you got to go to work""
And he sayin' ""Hey, this is my job, what I'm about to do""
So I'm like ""Hey man, some times you got to work (Or don't be a partner)
To do what you really wanna do""
We went through this whole brain wrestle
But anyway, he won (I'm standing by you)
He decided that ""Hey dad, I'm puttin' this thing, I'm doin' this
This is my job"" and he committed to it
And hey, the rest is history (You can do anything that you want to do)
I'm lookin' at him, I believe in him
I know what was in him
All him and his brothers and sisters
They all got the same mindset
Do your best, give a hundred percent or don't do it at all
So, I know whatever he put his all into, it was gon' be golden
Anyway
Look
March 10th, 2017, The Never Story dropped
And I'm comin' off of tour with ****
That was three years after openin' up for Ab-Soul
But it's EARTHGANG's set, I only came to do a song
DoeBurger used to say ""Ayy bro, this lil' nigga cold
Keep on doin' what you doin', you gon' make it, you 'gon blow""
I ain't know that Ced had went ahead and played my shit for Cole
But I knew he knew the game, and he pulled up to his show
And then that's where we first met, but I ain't think of it no more
'Til Ced Brown said that I should open up for Omen on my own shit, if I wanted
Only four cities, maybe we get Rob Gibbs on the phonin', I got to hone in
In the game grown men uncomfortable in they own skin
But all I wanted was a chance
It feel like I'm in a mannequin challenge
Still stance, but I'm still standin'
'Til my nigga lend a hand and I'm no longer stranded
Lookin' for strengths in the streets of East Atlanta
Momma said ""Don't take advice, they gon' try and take advantage""
I was 'bout to sign with Coach K, I ain't take the advance
Cole say ""Hold on, wait, bro, I got the plan
So come on, damn, lil nigga, come on, shit, let's roll, fuck""

Shsh, yo, that's crazy
That's crazy, yo JID, I remember
I remember you came to the crib
You remember this? After we had met
And I told you and EARTHGANG to pull up
To the crib in Carolina, it's the studio house
I wasn't on no shit, like ""Yo, I'm tryna do some Dreamville shit with y'all"", nah
It wasn't no talk of no deal, I didn't even know if I wanted to sign niggas
I just knew I, y'all was dope, I fuck with you
Just pull up, let's see what the vibe is like, let's work
In my mind, if something happen, it happen
If not, then cool, niggas just got a chance to link and kick it
But while we was there, the thing that I noticed off rip
I said, ""Oh, this nigga want it, this nigga really want it""
That look in your eye, nigga, I know that look
I know that look too well
But a lot of niggas want it
The thing I noticed about you my nigga, off rip
""This nigga don't just want it, he willin' to do the work that it takes to get it""

Both of us will win if I get a big break
Broke nigga dick? Baby, had a long day
Tryna get rich, buy you Dolce

Don't be tryna play me, I'm an artist, baby, I'm an artist

Chasin' with my heart in it
I just gotta make it to the stars, a spaceship or a rocket
Paintin', I'm an artist
I'm just tryna make it as an artist (And I'm sensitive about my shit)
I just gotta make it

Heavy way to hold the head and notice

You out of control, P-O-W-E-R
Went to the head and now you doin' bodily harm
On the meds and nobody wanna say
Because they scared to lose a gig
But yeah-yeah, you wanna be JID, kid
I used to wanna be Jay, I used to wanna be Wayne
I used to wanna be Kanye and Andre 3K
And all my homegirls wanted to be Beyoncé
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Woah, shit, I was just lookin' for a deal
Workin' so hard, had to sharpen my skills
Work with my dawgs, still sharpen my steel
Was still in apartments, stealin' and starvin'
Fast-forward, I'm in a buildin' with stars
And I got in Yachty car, he got stars in the ceilin'
Pause for a minute (Wait)
Gotta know the difference in the stars and the gimmicks
Are you really in it for the arts or the image?
Do you really live it in your heart and spirit?
It's part of all you are, and all you isn't
Heavy way to hold the head and notice (Trust your vision)
Just a long and cold and scary (Trust your vision)
But I don't even feel a thing no more
I set my goals and I'm prepared
Will you be there?

Man, I, I like these new slaves

Your chain hangin', bling swingin', back breakin'
But it's gleamin', problem posture, double cup leanin'
Slide, slouchin' tiger, pimpin' dragon on swagger
VVS is very vertebrae snappin', lights flashin'
A manicured appearance concealin' the shattered spirit
Jinn sneerin' out the paradox prism
The palace as the prison, retail religion
Red carpet constriction, the freedom is the fiction
As niggas raised specific is race really existin'
Man, get the bag, you're trippin'
Go 'head partner, hit this, sip this
Wishlist, hitlist, top ten, shit list, bitchless
Chickless, playmate, playboy, flip sides, same coin, big front
But no joy, yuck, oh boy, hot girls, cold hearts

No relation to class of Osiris
Kissin' cousins 'til the climbin' gas prices kill a climate
Yikes-es, sucker, mean muggin', who the nicest?

Had friends, but they was pickin' on me
Always thinkin', ""Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?""
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged

Reachin' for a life that I don't really need at all
Never listened to replies, learned a lesson from the wise
You should never take advice from a nigga that ain't try

They said I wouldn't make it out alive
They told me I would never see the rise
That's why I gotta kill 'em every time
Gotta watch 'em bleed, too

Don’t lie, you can hit my shit
You can lend me five, lil' nigga, on the side, lil' nigga
Couple thou’, need to fix my whip
How you switch sides on a nigga who was down with you, nigga?

You wanna fuck with me so bad right now
Well, now, you can't right now, oh, oh, oh

2018, I was at my sister house the whole summer (Yeah)
Songs wasn’t doin’ numbers (Yeah), whole life was goin' under
Left school, then my dad and I had a face-to-face in Atlanta
He said, ""It’s one in a million chance, son,"" I told him, ""Daddy, I am that one-uh, uh-uh""
I ain't never need him, huh, I ain't never need no nigga, uh
I ain't never need no feature
If I didn’t blow, I would've died tryna be here
If it didn't go, suicide, wouldn't be here
Now, they all come around like they've been here
When you get this rich and famous, everybody come up to you singin'

""You've been on my mind, you've been runnin' through it"", yeah (Hallelujah)

Tell me, are we finished now?
'Cause every time you leave, you find a way to come back around

I need time to give up just like before
I love it how you know I'd only come right back for more

My God, you're an angel
I only see you in your halo
I was hopin' we could stay close
But we no longer sing the same notes

I rеmember when I mеt you
Thought the universe sent you
Thought you were someone I could vent to
So I hit your line, what you getting into?

Hello, old friend from the road
I wanted to write a note
To let you know that all in all, it ain't all what it seems
I feel like I've hit a low
One I've never hit before
Lately, I've been feeling small as the salt in the sea
Oh, it's so much to do in so little of time
I feel like I fell a little behind
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
It seems so out of reach
The place I want to be
Whoever thought I'd get there anyway?
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go

Oh, Blue, I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue, I love you, too
But today, I'm gonna run away from home

Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
See, I'm getting tired of the way I've been living
I'd rather die than to live with these feelings
Stuck in this world where there's so much to prove
Every win gives you more room to lose
It's too many ups and downs on the ride
I spent inordinate 'mounts of time
Trapped in a lonely, loner life
Looking for love where I'm denied

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go

Life sucks and I never tried suicide
Mind's fucked even more than I realise
Time's up, keep it moving when she arrives
If you ever heard what I heard in my mind
Never try, you would cry, that's a lie, you would die
I don't wanna ever come down from a high
I'm in the best seat, from time, been a next breed
If you comin', come at me directly
Don't need no one to defend me
Soul's in a place even I can't get to, don't fuck with the deadly
Moon waves and open seas, quick coasting overseas
Fuck those who don't believe
They will never wanna admit I'm the best here
From the mere fact that I've got ovaries
It's a woman's world, so to speak
Pussy, you sour
Never givin' credit where it's due 'cause you don't like pussy in power

My, my, if you've ever heard what I've heard in the night
What a fright, must've been a parasite in my past life
I don't wanna ever come down from a high
My soul ascended to the sky, it's just you and I
God but I'm feelin' too alive
Tryna get me out of spite
Someone's gotta pay, I ain't talkin' big amounts
Some kind of physical pain
Some kind of traumatic shit
Niggas wanna see dead bodies
Probably not, they ain't rollin'
With no automatic clips
Moving scatty, all erratic and shit
Niggas pussy lickin', batty and shit
Oh, you mad? Then come at me, you prick
Make a move, better pattern it quick

Not a word, you will listen when my soul speaks
Down I go, so follow me, follow me, follow me
Actually, don't follow me, nobody bother me
I'm a mess, honestly, fuck all of your policies
They wanna kick me down and demolish me
Use me and fuckin' abolish me
I don't wanna hear no apologies
Or am I in my own head?
Can't tell anymore, psychotic to the death
When I dig deep, I can never find nothin' left
It's a mystery
Rage, nothin' but rage
Can't figure out if I'm goin' insane
Ain't no doubt we'll be showing no mercy
So think twice if you wanna get blazed

There's a war, there's a war

The kingdom's on fire, the blood of a young messiah
I see sinners in a church, I see sinners in a church
Sometimes I might be introvert
There's a war inside, I hear battle cries
Mothers burying sons, young boys playing with guns
The devil's a liar, fulfil your wildest desires
Now I don't wanna be the one to doctor this
But if you can't feel pain, then you can't feel the opposite
The fight between the Yin and Yang's a fight you'll never win
I study humans, that makes me an anthropologist
I'm not into politics, but I know it's dark times
Parts of the world still living in apartheid (Thеre's a war, there's a war)
But if I don't takе this winner's flight, that's career suicide
Though I should've been a friend when your grandma died
I see the illness eat my aunt laying in her bed
I see her soul rising as her body gets closer to death

Find a way, I'll find a way
The world's not over
I will make it, don't you cry
In God we trust
'Cause we're not alone
You might also like
I need a licence to feel
Internal wounds and I'm not tryna be healed (No, I don't, no, I don't)
I sabotage what we are trying to build
'Cause of feelings I keep inside, but it's time to reveal (Reveal, reveal)
I hate the thought of just being a burden
I hate that these conversations are surfaced
Simz the artist or Simbi the person?
To you I'm smiling, but really, I'm hurting
I dedicate my life and gave my heart over twenty-something years
Left wondering how I even feel
But was it even worth it?
I bottle up and then spill it in verses
One day, I'm wordless, next day, I'm a wordsmith
Close to success, but to happiness, I'm the furthest
At night, I wonder if my tears will dry on their own
Hoping I will fulfil Amy's purpose
Angel said, ""Don't let you ego be a disturbance""
Inner demon said, ""Motherfucker, you earned this""
Like they strip you of everything you're deserving
Realise there is a prison in us, we are conditioned as fuck
Man, it's like they can't sleep till our spirit is crushed
How much fighting must we do? We've been fearless enough
All we seen is broken homes here and poverty
Corrupt government officials, lies, and atrocities
How they talking on what's threatening the economy?
Knocking down communities to re-up on properties
I'm directly affected, it does more than just bother me
Look beyond the surface, don't just see what you wanna see
My speech ain't involuntary
Projecting intentions straight from my lungs
I'm a Black woman and I'm a proud one
We walk in blind faith not knowing the outcome
But as long as we're unified, then we've already won
Find a way, I'll find a way
The world's not over
I will make it, don't you cry
In God we trust
'Cause we're not alone

Sometimes I can be introvert
Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert
Introvert
Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert
Sometimes I can be introvert
And so it begins
The base is an amalgamation of everything
Rules are not to be played by rebels
The story of never-ending
Your introversion led you here
Intuition protected you along the way
Feelings allowed you to be well balanced
And perspective gave you foresight
The top of the mountain is nothing without the climb
Only the strong will survive
Only the strong (Will survive)
Alone, but not lonely
Your truth unveils with time
As you embark on a journey
Of what it takes to be a woman34Embed",https://images.genius.com/82967dab7e5483f2cdfb659e7b29a4e5.1000x1000x1.jpg

Oh
All my life been a black sheep
All my life been the black keys
True I never really was a bad breed
Daddy probably rather me an athlete
Man that nigga move like a taxi
All my life in the backseat
You talk about life is it that sweet?
All these eyes staring at me

I've been feeling real low nigga, lowkey (lowkey)
How a brave heart feeling so weak? (so weak)
Tattoos on my passport, no sleep (no sleep)
This is what you asked for don't weep
Don't winge, man I'm here and I won't leave
All I wanna do, make songs, blow trees
Wouldn't be honest with myself if I don't speak
So I make the point to address 'em man you know me (hey)
Got me believing in Buddha the more I proceed (yuh)
Oh this life isn't guaranteed (yuh)
All my life felt a cold breeze
In and out but staying up and never down, you hearing me now?
Give me some time and a little space, I'll figure it out
They wanna know my whereabouts, and who I'm around
Been in wonderland for time, tryna' find our way out
You can hear it my rhymes, I'll be thinking aloud
I'ma be ghost for a minute don't get in your feelings
I ain't even wrote for a minute, not a single lyric

All I hear 'em saying is look what you've become
This is what you signed up, before you forget
This is what you get, uh, this is what you get

All these eyes in the front row, hella' pure souls in the front row
Remember seeing J Cole I was in the front row
Couldn't move, was in awe if you must know
Still struggling to find who I trust though
All my life in the cut though (yuh)
All my life caught the bus home, through the north side
Then I got a pedal bike, mommy flipped when I got home
Like, people get, killed out here but mummy I'm a rider and a fighter
Never been a dickhead in life, don't ever try me
Don't get it confused 'cause I'm humble and I'm quiet
Loud niggas step into Simz and get silenced
I ain't gotta say how but it don't involve violence
Though I got Gs that are already in the hair for it
But there's no need, I just want peace
Take me higher, get an eight from the supplier
Make your mind up, what you mean? What you desire?
Niggas hating but it's cool man, it's a minor
I just do me on my own and I'm the driver
Twenty-three feeling older and I'm wiser
All my life been searched for what I'd die for
Guess I am the one, the people I'ma fight for
Surely you should know who you rep, who you ride for

Diamonds are forever
Miss Sierra Leone, lookin' like a gem
Works hard in the week, party on the weekend
Know you wanna live with no one watchin' how you spend
Got a thing for the finer things and the finer men, hm
Miss Tanzania, she a do or die
Say she want to know more 'bout the Sukuma tribe
We hit the zoot, once wasn't enough
Got an ocean full of knowledge, you could scuba dive
Miss Ethiopia can play so jazzy
Then sit you down and school you on Selassie

Tell 'em you're nothin' without a woman, no
Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow
Tell 'em what's up

I love how you go from zero to one hundred
And leave the dust behind, you've got this
All action, no talk

Self made, ain't nobody doin' gold digger
Now, Miss India always speaks with her chest
Got respect from her people 'cause she leads them the best
Hm, real life queen in the flesh
Know the crown get heavy, still it be's on your head
Brooklyn ladies, know you hustle on the daily
Innovative just like Donna Summer in the eighties
Your time, they seein' you glow now
Intelligence and elegance, show 'em how
Miss Jamaica understand food for the soul
She get up in the kitchen know she throw down

Ain't nothin' without a woman, no
Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow
Tell 'em what's up

I love how you go from zero to one hundred
And leave the dust behind, you've got this
All action, no talk
I see you glow, you're the finest gold
When you walk in the room, they feel your soul
Our style, it shines, so ahead of time
And you know that you're fire, you're so damn fine, girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

She a Ghana girl
Calm with it, never let the marijuana fail
Though a sucker for the romance, take you to the homeland
One way, she ain't comin' back, nah

Time's up, tell the people that we comin', yeah, yeah
Done bein' in the shadow, goin' public, yeah, yeah
Don't know how to bear it, how to stomach, yeah, yeah
Hand over the shit and let us run it, yeah, yeah
All we know is lookin' flawless, all they know is stare, stare

Ain't nothin' without a woman, though
Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow (Glow, glow)

I love how you go from zero to one hundred
And leave the dust behind, you've got this
And lead them with your light
You've got this (Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow)
All action, no talk (Tell 'em what's up)
You know, Simbi
Sometimes, you know, I just look around
And I just think of all the things we've gone through
All the great things in life and all the horrible things that are just the other half of the great things in life
And how you don't really get greatness without sacrifice
And you don't get good things without a little bit of pain
And how happiness is the substitute for the emptiness that you can sometimes feel on the other side
I dunno, it just reminds me to call you
But then you never pick up the phone!10Embed",https://images.genius.com/82967dab7e5483f2cdfb659e7b29a4e5.1000x1000x1.jpg

But still, nah, they don't wanna give no props, but life's good when you make this much dough

Name one time where I didn't deliver
Silent figure

I got a 3310 and a pack of blems
Then got the Golf, all-black, circle back again

We all have our demons
Our thoughts, our imperfections and our insecurities
None of which make us inhumane
This is our tale
The proton, the neutron and the electron
The positive, the negative and the ground
The trial, the person and the story of
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Prolly not

Real dark in the cemetery
Where the souls lie, oh my
What've I become, man, I’m so high
Quit killing my buzz
Love drunk in the maze like: ""What have you done?
Where the hell are you taking me?
What are we running from?""
Demons in the back of my closet, don’t talk to them
You wouldn’t want to be me, 'cuz I’ve walked with them
And it wasn’t a nice walk: traumatised
Left me in a bad head space
Lookin' to Heaven’s door, I've been saved, or have I?
Asked for forgiveness, can I or will I?
Negative at heart, am I?
Or shall I explain what the world done to me?
You wouldn’t understand what I been through fully
And these dark thoughts never been new to me
And nobody lovin' me; everybody through with me
Everybody lookin' at me different
And nobody’ll listen
I can see you starin' at me: what do you envision?
No faith in me, should I resort to religion?
But even, I could never change the life I’m livin'
I’m a druggie, I’m a fiend
Neva' been clean
Soul’s always been tainted
Homeless: what'chu know about livin' on the street?
Cold nights, you know, right? Nothin' to eat
Figured that you wouldn't give me money anyways
Even though I hear the coins rattlin' in your jeans
I ain’t even beggin' no more
Fuck it! Maybe I’ll just beg a little more
But don’t judge me
God above me, why do you have me livin' like a junkie?
Fuck, man
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Prolly not
Dark clouds, nigga, fuck a rainbow
Nobody talk until I say so
I just might sell my soul, if it’s worth anything
But we’ll see how the day goes
You might also like
I just might sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more

Prolly not
I'mma sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not

Ooh, mind’s on overload!
Hit straight to the face, might overdose!
This ain’t the life I chose: what would you know?
This ain’t the beginning: I ain’t even come close
Bare robbing, activity indulge
Is it very human? I don’t think I have a pulse
Blacked out in the night, nigga
Devil on both shoulders: ain't no motherfuckin' angel to my right, nigga!
Have you ever seen a grown man cry? Never me
Shit, I need that nicotine
Heals me like medicine
Gotta be aware all times
Better be dogs out here
Lookin' for a different pedigree
Know you see it
Never get too comfy
Me nuh' trust nobody
Feds always wanna roll on me
I ain’t done nuttin', I’m so sorry
You can take time, no hurry
Even though that I ain’t slept for days
My body’s aching, but my mind’s awake
Shit, the flow is crazy, I should rhyme for change
Oh, dear lady, gimme the time of day
See you a mile away
I can never own up to my mistakes
Perhaps, it’ll take me to a higher state
No escape, I’m tryin' to find a way
I’m the one that you was tryna save
Please, give up, you don’t have time to waste
This is real, I’ve been waitin' my whole life to feel
Do you wanna see a dead body? No chill
I just might sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Will anybody miss me?
Have you ever seen a dead body?

This is my story, wait, nah
This is our story, this is our fate
This is our kingdom, this is our place
This is our freedom, cut off them chains
This is our struggle, this is our pain
This is our love, this is our trust
This is our daughters, this is our sons
Give me back my wings, yeah
Oh
Give me back my wings, see, I just wanna fly again
Wanna try, fail, try to try again
Head up in the stars, I promise I'm higher then
The right person for the job, you hire then fire them
I be working for the same thing, towards the same goal
Are we losing the passion in which we came for?
I was strong but identifying the same flaws
Fighting each other but battling for the same cause, let me breathe
Ain't got the time to be your enemy
That shit is draining, they're taking up too much energy
I'd rather invest in something that's worth it, the time is precious
So for Simz to waste it is something you'll never see, hold me to it
Everything is just a memory
It's getting modest then and never modest then, then I remember
I am not fucking about, getting modest is an error
I'll be fine as long as I've got my head up (breathe!)
I ain't prayed in a minute
Before you judge me, hold that thought and let me finish
For a long time I thought that praying was just asking for things
Like the road to riches and diamond rings
But now I know that I just gotta be thankful
Blessings every day, shit, I've got my hands full
Lessons every day, I'm learning for more angles
Mum, stop stressing over shit that I'mma handle, don't you know?
Simbi got you, I ain't even gotta say it
The album's here, I hope you love it, hope you play it
I know you knew this day would come, I know you prayed it
Can't wait to look at you and tell you that I made it
It's amazing
Good things come to the people that wait and I waited
Tell me, do you believe the quote above I stated?
Nobody handed me a dream, I had to chase it
I had to be business-minded and put aside my feelings
I had to find my own truth, my own meanings
Wrote this in the same bedroom I started in
Had to dream big, had to look beyond my ceiling
Do you feel it?
Hand on my heart, if only you could feel the way it's beating
I mean it
This the type of music that ain't never gonna sell? Well
Shouldn't never ever tell me that
Should've never ever told me that
What if I prove you wrong? Tell me know, could you live with that?
No, you wouldn't wanna live that
I ain't saying this'll go to number one, oh, I ain't saying that
I know you know that I ain't saying that
I just wanna do this all for my people, fuck the rest
Give you realness every time, nothing more, nothing less, and it goes like
No time for these low-lives
I'm onto something bigger all thanks to the most high
Becoming more relentless and less defensive, it's in my mechanism
Who give a fucks about cosigns?
Never scared of killing 'em, something that's too real
They don't have to play this, I know that Huw will, and you will
No, you can't ignore it
Many of us want this life but just ain't cut out for it, yeah
So don't you ever
Forget who told you this
No, don't you ever
See, this is for your kids
Yeah, don't you ever
Overlook this here
So this is our message, this is our faith
This is our voice, this is our names
This is our new, now we want change
This is our sun, this is our rain
This is our win, this is our fail
This is our hands, how can we help?
This is our heaven, this is our hell

I love you
I hate you
I love you
I hate you
I love you

So much, I would give my life for this (I hate you)
If the bullet was the beat, I would probably die for this (I love you)
How many times did I cry for this? (I hate you)
I would hate myself if I didn't at least try for this (I love you)
What's at stake is bigger than me
Blood, tears, how it stains, can't rid it with ease (I hate you)
What we have in common is our pain, we're given the keys  (I love you)
To unlock what it takes to fight for what we believe in (I hate you)
Hard to confront the truth of what you see in thе mirror (I love you)
Some peoplе you inspire and others you trigger (I hate you)
Fightin' in blind faith, led by the internal voice (I love you)
You might not wanna do it, but you don't have a choice (I hate you)
Will the pressure take me to new heights or be my demise? (I hate you)
Will my intentions coincide with what I advise? (I hate you)
The people lookin' up to me, doin' everything right (I hate you)
But who am I to tell anyone how to live their life? (I hate you)
Your pain threshold will determine if you survive
I'm amazed by it
Lyin' to myself, pretendin' I was never phased by it
Maybe 'cause you're in my DNA, that's why

You made a promise to God to be there for your kids (I love you)
You made a promise to give them a life you didn't live (I hate you)
My ego won't fully allow me to say that I miss you (I love you)
A woman who hasn't confronted all her daddy issues (I hate you)
The day will come when you gotta find all the answers to your sins (I love you)
Pressures of providin', feelin' unhappy within (I hate you)
Or what kind of external family shit up on your plate (I love you)
But I understand wantin' and needin' an escape (I hate you)
Too much unsaid now, the silence givin' me headaches (I love you)
Only through speech can we let go of all this dead weight (I hate you)
Even though I'm angry, don't wanna be disrespectful (I love you)
Tryna figure out how to approach this in the best way (I hate you)
Hard to not carry these feelings even on my best days (I love you)
Never thought my parent would give me my first heartbreak (I hate you)
Anxiety givin' me irregular heart rate (I love you)
Used to avoid gettin' into how I really feel about this (I hate you)
Now I see how fickle life can be and so it can't wait (I love you)
Should've been the person there to hold me on my dark days (I hate you)
It's easier to stargaze and wish than be faced with this reality (I love you)
Is you a sperm donor or a dad to me? And still
I love you (Hard to love tonight)
I hate you
I love you (Hard to love tonight)
I hate you
Always, I love you
But right now, I hate you
Always, I love you (Hard to love tonight)

On this mission, you live and learn (I love you)
The world will show you no mercy from birth (I hate you)
How do you humanise your hero? (I love you)
'Round here, you're only respected if earned (I hate you)
Half-hearted sorries, can't let your guard down (I love you)
To get to nirvana, where do you start out? (I hate you)
Angry 'cause they don't meet your unrealistic standards (I love you)
Then you realise that they're human and you calm down (I hate you)
Sometimes I'm unbalanced and I think, ""Rah, why am I losin' my steps?""
Lately, I'm paranoid, I feel my life is a mess
I'm just usin' my voice, hope it will have an effect
He was just once a boy, often I seem to forget
Lookin' at Polaroids of pictures secretly kept
You know what was destroyed, but you don't know what was left
Tryna phase out the noise of who you hear in your head
Everything is a choice and anything can be said
Is you missin' the point? Are you just hearin' me vent?
Or is you in understandin', knowin' my words will connect?
I keep you in my prayers 'cause life is short as we know
Every mistake you make should contribute to your growth
What you choose to avoid'll probably come in your dreams
I'm not forgivin' for you, man, I'm forgivin' for me

I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish

Got a very big ego
Embedded in me that's the heritage ego
And let 'em hate, they ain't messing with the steeze though
And now I'm here, can't entertain no bummy niggas
Need my nigga fresh in a tuxedo
Me and my new case, steady blowing weed smoke
I'm a woman who can teach you a little something about class (Class)
Diamonds will forever be a girl's best friend (Friend)
Everything's imperative for the way I live
I know it's material, but not irrelevant
All this here is worked for, not inherited
Tell myself I write my niggas off but never did
Self loving
Need more self loving, that's how it goes
They wanna know you when you're buzzing
But first things first, number one and priority
Call it what you want, doesn't phase
Doesn't bother me, honestly

Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha

Love and hate can never be friends
Don't rush everything in this divine time
I peaked, you couldn't handle a woman in my calibre
Had to let you mature like some fine wine, yeah
No validation, no applause
You don't have to prove you got it when you know it's yours
I don't wanna feel disloyal for wanting to do me
Then you act brand new and I know the cause, wait
Call it what you like, till now I ain't ever been the selfish type
Till now I ain't ever told nobody no, don't get it twisted
This shit didn't happen overnight
Still, if your life is amazing, what you got to fear?
Can't be concerned about what they're saying over there
I make it clear, don't be in and out about what you hear
You say I always get what I want and it isn't fair
But life isn't fair, go
I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life

Never cared 'bout bein' immortalised
How can I stand with the opps and not with the tribe?
They sell you a dream and then want you to glorify
Got a rude awakenin' by ignorin' up all the signs
Why did I give you the keys to authorise shit on my behalf?
Now I'm scarred and mortified
What did I expect from those livin' the corporate life?
Unfortunately, honesty isn't normalised
Had to get my shit together and get organised
If your hand's in my pockets, I'm callin' up all the guys
Though, I don't wanna be the reason of more divide
Guess that's in my nature of bein' a water sign
I'm sort of like
Nothing is makin' sense in my awkward mind
Give me your ears to lend me for the night
Shootin' in the dark, guess I never saw the light
Revoke access, I'm runnin' it back, yes
Missin' opportunities, I wish I was that pressed
Yeah, I say that shit with my damn chest
You need me and you feel the loss of my absence
The novelty wears oft after a few years
After a few tears from challengin' new fears
Learnin' everything I didn't on the come up
We was too busy makin' music till the sun up
Every day through the summer
Didn't learn the business and now I'm duckin' for cover
What a fuck up
Might just leave a bad taste thinkin' I'm a sucker
Come up out my damn face, nigga, did I stutter?
It's gon' be a sad case if you see my brothers
I can see how an artist can get tainted, frustrated
They don't care if your mental is on the brink of somethin' dark
As long as you're cuttin' somebody's payslip
And sendin' their kids to private school in a spaceship
Yeah, I refuse to be on a slave ship
Give me all my masters and lower your wages
Huh, what I'm bringin' to the table is more than a feast for the belly of the beast
Didn't know I'm droppin' somethin' heavy for the streets
Fuck the politics, I'm goin' Meghan on you neeks
I need the best seats in the house
When the truth unfolds, it's gonna be one hell of a scene
Harry listenin' from Heaven on repeat
He was backin' it when nobody believed
""Play the game, play the game,"" is what they scream
You can play the game, I don't see the need, no

Feel so alive
I woke up and I prayed for a sign
I know good things take time
God sent me you as an angel
When you're alone
The little thoughts that nobody knows
Hardest thing to do was stay strong
I knew I needed an angel

My Saturn return in effect
Life doesn't come with presets
My frequency's seamless
They want you give more, expect you to dream less
Got me confessin' all my secrets
You ain't the only one under deep stress
Please don't take my kindness for a weakness
Get G checked for your disrespect
Perception and observation is clinical
More headspace, I've been shavin' off my occipital
They say you can't hate who you don't love
And they say love is unconditional
I'm ready to do the unthinkable
Fuck rules and everything that's traditional
Giving your heart to someone might just leave you in a somethin', somethin'
Feel so alive
I woke up and I prayed for a sign
I know good things take time
God sent me you as an angel
When you're alone
The little thoughts that nobody knows
Hardest thing to do was stay strong
I knew I needed an angel

How you go against the same system you were colonised by?
Brother, your whole ting compromised
Havin' these conversations with self and nobody else
Thinkin' they don't understand my thinkin' when I socialise
I need a angel with me for armour
I need accountability, partner
I know that all these blessings are karma
I need a fire lit by the seaside
Purest manuka up in my beehive
Give me a second and let the beat ride
Is there a golden key to the sweet life?
I don't know what's got into me
But at least I'm makin' time for self and not others when I got free time
New woman, don't tell me I shouldn't just because you couldn't
They say, ""Don't you give up too much of the truth to 'em""
Well, I got nine more songs in the boot for 'em
Figure this is the moment, I gotta speak now
Head high, back straight, feet down
Posture goin' crazy
Had to stand tall while they were tryin' to break me
Fuck that, you niggas didn't make me
And I say you will never infiltrate me
Dim my light? Are you crazy?
Yo, we two worlds apart, you know, lady, lady, lady
Flo and I comin' like DeNiro and Scorsese
Stop tryin' to box me in, there's no way you can place me
Hit 'em with a classic then I got a little lazy
Had to get a pen when I remembered that I'm JAY-Z
Had to cut you off because I found out you were snaky
I got angels guidin' my steps, guardin' my life from now until death
Perspective is everything and I wonder what they see
Hurt people hurt people, I get it, but don't play me
My Saturn return in effect
Life doesn't come with presets
My frequency's seamless
So, please don't take my kindness for a weakness

You would trade intellect for an artificial booty (Oh-ooh)

Tenisha held you down, but you want Lucy (Oh-ooh)

Okay, if you love me, baby, why'd you want to lose me? (Oh-ooh)
You use me, confuse me, accuse me, it's truly a movie (Yeah, yeah)
Covered with silver linings, it took time just to learn about timing (Oh-ooh)
I got lost in it, you got lost in it
You clocked out, meanwhile I stayed bossin' it (Oh-ooh)
What it cost to be this damn hot with it?
Who knew love would be so damn toxic? (Oh-ooh)
I am intoxicated, exhilarated, finally moved on
How devastating for you (Oh-ooh)
Got my groove on, meditatin' too, creatin', makin' innovative moves (Oh-ooh)

Me again, allow me to pick up where I left off
The biggest phenomenon and I'm Picasso with the pen
Niggas always talk shit until I hit them with the realness
Figured I should say some', but you don't wanna hear me vent
You can talk bad all day long, I will never be impressed
Dunno what I did to make you feel that you be earnin' my respect
You do not scare me, no, you are not a threat
Anyone that want it they can get it in a flash, no sweat
If you're gonna talk on my name, least say it with your chest
Got my team on deck taking out all pawns and my knight got your queen in check, mate
Don't get touchy, don't be getting in your feelings
All I do is kill shit, shit, even when I'm chillin'
I'm Jay-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days
Never been a punk, trust you can get it in the worst way
Fuck it, lemme get a birthday cake and it ain't even my birthday
'Cause when I switch then they wanna say that I'm a bitch

You're not listening, you're not listening
I said it with my chest and I don't care who I offend, uh-huh
Haa

Came through swinging out the gate on a mad one, no fucks
Steppin' to the kid tryna bring it, I promise you'll have no luck
You sold out for a quick buzz and honey, you got no love
No less than what I know that I'm worth and I won't budge
In and out of doorways juggin'-juggin' through the broadway
Anthony, where would I be now if I went and done it your way?
I been exhausted, man, I think I need a tour break
Might take a trip to the Philippines with my Spanish boy Jorge
Holla my plug like, ""I'm back in town and I need a ounce gimme more flavs""
Take Mum on a spree like, ""Get anything you want, this is your day""
I followed the white rabbit, got a couple carrots I know that I got bad habits
Tryna find the balance, I'm in the store like, ""I wanna have it I gotta have it""
You are not the toughest or baddest, my pen is the maddest
I've probably ended careers and it's never out of malice
Gas level ain't even on 10 and still they can't manage
They think I'm a shy one, like, ""Nah Simz won't flip""
But when I switch, then they wanna say that I'm a bitch

Got it back, never lost it, my legacy remains
Rejected the dotted line but not the pen
Invested in myself, that was money well spent
Came home, mummy burning incense
'Member tryna think of ways to help contribute to the rent
Now the room's upstate, top suite penthouse
Views where there's no family or friends
What life do I want? Know I gotta choose 'fore it's too late
Well I guess it all depends, uh
I was running with Toby and them
Never looked back once I discovered the pen
Dedicated it all to the art
Who would've known it would be this from the start?
Stop fucking with my heart

Grew up in the South side of that River Thames
Hard to think outside the box when you're stuck in the Ends
I had dreams of many things as a youngin
I was fourteen when the streets offered tough lovin'
Older brother went to jail, daddy weren't around
No choice now but to be the man of the house
If you're talking role models, nowhere to be seen
You can't fathom what I think 'til you been where I been
PTSD from the roads, trouble was everywhere that I looked
Hard to avoid it even if I just kеpt my head in my books
There ain't no еasy way out, drownin' internally
When you're stuck in a ocean of doubt with all this uncertainty
Lived bein' angry my whole life like it's part of my DNA
I couldn't tell you why it became something that we embraced
Then we take that same anger and turn it into someone else's pain
Nothing's changed here, the cycle still remains

To walk with me, my journey's begun
See, my mama told me my sun will shine
We don't decide everything in God's time
And when mama told me, I knew that I
Was strong inside, but we all cry sometimes

Shit changed when I had a brief encounter with death
Thought the pearly gates opened when that knife was in my chest
Not the mental scars, the physical's all you see
But the boy that stabbed me is just as damaged as me
I could have been the reflection that he hated
The part of him he wishes God did not waste time creating
The broken homes in which we're comin' from, but who's to blame when
You're dealt the same cards from the system you're enslaved in?
It's fucking mayhem
Imagine being in a hospital, wired up to the machines
They told me I had been in a coma for two weeks
But time is an illusion, my mind told me I'm invincible
But my body reminded me I'm human
When you're so close to the Heavens, God shows you who's there
Nowhere to be seen are the people who said they care

Would you take me as I am? Overlook all my mistakes?
Though correct me when I'm wrong, humble me, put me in my place?
Would you be the one I come to when I'm needin' an escape?
Still be my biggest fan if I canceled all my dates?
I got shit I haven't dealt with, would you help me through my pain?
If it's any reassurance, just know I would do the same
Lookin' at you, I know that God took His time
Hope I'm seein' the real you, not a disguise
Know I like my time alone, but still don't wanna be lonely
Whisper in my ear and tell me you won't leave
Time flies, can't tell you how much we've spent
'Cause I'm present in this moment, hope this feeling never ends

Hopin' that I never wake up
'Cause in this dream, I'll never be alone
You saved my life
I'm hopin' that I never wake up
Somethin' so special, we can't let it go
With you, I'll never be alone
I'm hopin' that I never wake up

Never thought you'd be so special in my life
This is love built over time, this wasn't love at first sight
When plannin' for my future, I've been keepin' you in mind
If we ever grow apart, hope our stars will realign
You know where you come from, you ain't forgotten
It's an honour to witness and watch you blossom
You want words of affirmation and I got 'em for you
No situation is perfect
But givin' up without tryin' is what we're not gonna do
I'm speakin' your love language, readin' body language
Our connection requires a deeper understandin'
Communication isn't always verbal
But energy transferred is universal
They talk it, but we put it into practice
Centre each other, makin' sure nothin' here can knock us off our axis
That's real companionship, you as sweet as molasses
Intelligence that's matched with beauty in all its facets
Here to see us goin' forwards and never backwards
Anyone that's in our presence sees the clear attraction
Past situations didn't work and someone done the hard graft
Just for you to reap the benefits, but that's what happens
My God, been lookin' divine lately, hydrated, melanated
Don't like the fuss, but this deserves to be celebrated
There's just certain flex that comes with feelin' exhilarated
Ain't it just the best ownin' it? Knowin' you've elevated?

I don't wanna be up, I been down for days
Layin' in my misery, hopin' I will be saved
Stuck in my ways, stubborn, I know it can't be changed
Livin' in isolation, attention I never crave
There go little Simbi from around the way
She wanted the credibility, never cared for fame
While the palette fades, release the colours of pain
It's a black and white world, still in the area GREY

Handshakes and how-are-yous and what-you've-been-up-tos
And will-you-be-home-soons and when-are-you-droppin'-again?
Sussin' me out, secretly hopin' I'm done with the pen
No receipts, can't return the gift I was sent
Everything I touch is felt with the purest intent
Conversations with you is causin' resentment
Hard to accept the realness, she said
(Don't stop) I've been lovin' you freely
Back when you was broke, handin' out them CDs
Tried to fall in love and you cut 'cause you need me
I told you, ""Give it up"" and you never believed me

Feelings equals weakness and that's why you bury yours
Understand you are just a vessel for the Lord

Honesty is in my bones, I can't do the fake
Life's too short and I've seen too many tears
I've come too far for me to be consumed by my fears
Can't believe the space I'm in with my older sister
I left the global empire and now she thinks I dissed her
It weren't that, I just needed to explore shit on my own
I just needed to figure out—, mmm

When it comes to family, see, now you testin' me
You want my everything until there's nothing left of me
I just wanted you to call me, sayin', ""Hey, sis, how's your day been?
How's your love life? Who you datin'?
Oh, he fucked up? Girl, I had the same thing
But there's a bigger picture God is painting""

My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, it gets shady
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson, or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the D-low, and he know

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me

Hey, hey

Fuck your dead homies, run your bread, homie
Got some lead for me, I'm on Artesia
Parked in my Bimmer, bumping my own shit
I'm focused, they stuck on that old shit
Living for that True Religion is broke shit
I could spend that on a MAC with a long clip
Fly in that Benz, but you hide in that Focus
My nigga, just focus, I'm trying to paint you a picture
We stuck in the moment
My burner get stuck if I shoot it too much
So a nigga resorted to doming
That's somebody's son, but a war to be won
Baby, either go hunt or be hunted
We crabs in a bucket
He called me a crab, so I shot him in front of the Douglas
I cannot be fucked with, we thuggin' in public

Won't hug your bitch when the ho ratchet
Cold jumper, been shooting, no practice
Been touring, whip foreign, coupe crashing
Still banging 2 Naughty 2 Nasty
Still ""fuck the police,"" they won't catch me
My feature too pricey, don't ask me
Go hard 'til Goyard on my baggage
He mad, we won't fight, I'm gon' tag him
Mask up at midnight and start clapping
Kids crying, still snipe him, no lacking

So far from my past misfortune
No sleepin', late nights, no eatin'
Gun squeezing, I'm a real Artesian
Ramona, I was 'round that corner
Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down Sawyer
When we slide, you won't see morning
Another story of a young Black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, Goddamn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin', don't shake my hand
Take it easy, homie

Of the 22 bus stop way back when
With the .22, 5 shot eyes on scan

Know they hate to see me make cash, got the space dash
In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation, conversations, what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking
Quarterbackin' like I'm 40 Water
Mix the holy water with the Voss

Never gon' switch, my momma raised soldiers
Show me that profit, cough them Rang Rovers
Up, I'm up now, these hoes all in love now
Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over
Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes useless
Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless
Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless
Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome
Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit
5-0 fucking with the yayo too
L-B-P-D get sprayed on too
Always keep it GC, ask my homies for the proof

Shit real in the field, get caught, don't squeal
Best deal that the judge finna offer: life
Play this track in Calipat, get it poppin' in the prison
And play this shit in Ironwood where my little brother livin'
Live or die for the whoopin' or the Crippin', pick a side
Death row, till they put you in the Pikachu to fry
That's life, three strikes, that's life
Three hoes, half dyke, this can be a long night
Long road to the riches, bravos from the bitches
Coulda' been a felon selling nickels off of Linden

Hope your skin is black as midnight, I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz, I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Our father art in heaven as I pray for new McLarens
Pray the police don't come blow me down 'cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now 'cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie, how dare you think it's different?
Boy, you trippin'

Gas break and dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah, I stacked that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for pictures, back back, I'm trippin'
Back back, better back back, you don't know me
Better back back, better back back, you don't know me

Go in 'til they take my bro and 'em out them CDCRs
Prison system broken, racial war commotion
Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office

My bitch look like Madonna ('Donna), they staring at Katana
Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should've brought the chopper (Whoo)
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer
But he looking at me crazy when we pull up to the projects

See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray, Jehovah, lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions, fix me up

This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever, baby
Open up your eyes and tell me what you thinking
Open up your mind, and tell me what you seeing inside of me
Why we fussing, fucking up this evening?
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meaning
What's the grudge that you're holdin'? Hold my hand
Let me take you to the land where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart
If we don't love, then we fall apart

This could be forever, baby
I never seen you wetter, baby
Than when the tears fall, soakin' up your sweater, baby
I didn't mean harm—don't make me regret it, baby
'Cause if I never knew you, I could never do this to you
Hope you understand
They never taught me how to be a man, only how to be a shooter
I only need the time to prove it
'Cause this could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever, baby

My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missing you
I'm searching for atonement
Do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone

As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home
Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman
Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming:
""Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!""
Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined
Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that
Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High
But my daddy was the man that would be suicide
Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back

Made me promise that this shit would never touch my hands
And it never did said it'd make me be a better man

Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand
Momma trying to wake him up, young so I ain't understand
Why she wouldn't let my daddy sleep, used to see him stand
Out in the alley through my window
Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke
Lights flashing now he running from the Winslows
Hear him screaming from my momma at the backdoor
Sometimes she wouldn't open it, sitting on the couch
Face emotionless, I don't think they ever noticed that I noticed it
As a kid all I wanted a hundred grand

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that
Catch him riding round the city with the seat back

With the seat back, with the seat back
Catch him ride round the city with the seat back
No, No, No, No
Niggas die everyday don't know how to live, don't know how to make sense
25 to life today just got locked away, all that just to pay rent
Now they're all bound on the slave ship
And they left behind their patience
Thought that'd last them for a little
Pass it down for my kin, ohh

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that

One time, circling the block (The block)
Lil buddy got murdered on a flock
Two times, you know how we rock (You know how we rock)
You know who we knocked on, you know who we socked
You know how we comin', come from nothin', I got
Christian Dior, I'm Crippin' Björk
Made an uh-oh letting Vince in the door
Gave a little money to me, now I want more
Don't be lookin' funny when we come up in the store
My black is beautiful but I'll still shoot at you, dawg
2Pac, death tells all
Watch out for the niggas in the Lakewood mall
Get you touched, Nobu brunch
No big chains, no blue Chucks
Just big things, cuz gon' bust
'Cause short bus, but we ain't on one

We just wanna have fun
We don't wanna fuck up nothin'

What's your addiction, baby?
Love can make a bitch go crazy
Kiss, hug, fuck, and then get faded
Fall out, and it's all-out war
Head twirl, and your vision blurrin'
Dopeman in that kitchen stirrin'
Sold it, we so lit, dope burners
Fuck is you so forgetful for?
Girl, you know that you need that raw
Girl, you know that you need Visine
Preem laced with that cocaín'
Pop a pill, pop what's in them jeans
Cop a feel, cop a half-sixteen
Pour a deuce up, and then start leaning
Tryna die higher than Pimp C
And Big Moe, you know how the shit go

I pray to God 'cause I need Him
I need Him, I need Him
Cocaine withdrawals, and I'm fiending

Kicc cacc ce cool, watch a nigga get it
I be all around the city with the semi naughty crippin'
All the homies say I'm different, police say I raise suspicion
Buy a million-dollar home and blow my dome to paint the kitchen
Bitches like, ""Is that Venetian?""
Niggas salty when they meet him
Cause they never finna beat him
And they'll never get a feature
I'm a star, tell Billy I'ma bill him for the sneakers
You conversin' with a nigga, better be about the green
I've been broke, I ain't goin' back
Rather go to Calipat, or murdered while I'm shootin' back
Call me King Latifah
If we talkin' bout your bitch and she a keeper
Better keep her in the house
Watch your mouth
Don't be talkin' from the bleachers, nigga

Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God...with the signal clear as day
Put my Glock, put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay

My bitch look like Mona Lisa
Hammers busting like a soda in the freezer
Think of heading to Ibiza
Need a breather from the tripping
Either that or my brains to the ceiling
Bite the bullet, tryna fight the feeling
Fuck around and pull it, push it to the limit
Ain't a thang to a G
Life give you lemons, nigga hang from a tree
Cold game all came in a dream
Woke up feeling like the walls caved in
Fought to the death, never gave in
Write that on the grave that I get laid in
Heaven, Hell, free or jail, same shit
County jail bus, slave ship, same shit

Learned the power of words when we was younger
Saying fuck the sign on his curb can make him hunt you
Turned the African into the nigga then they hung him
Said it earlier in the verse, sometimes I wonder
Who the activist and who the Devil's advocate
Or do it matter? Shit
They only fucking with the rapper if the rapper rich
Or got a platinum hit
A chain or two
Seem the music interchangeable
Raging bull, what you headed for?
Heaven doors, or hell below
I write directions for the road to let you know
Edgar Allen Poe
Tried to warn 'em of demise and all he seen was crows
Feel for 'em, words, we kill for 'em

Trying to trade the hoes life for the red rose life
Hope we roll dice, but a seed ain't what you want

Every step you take will get you closer to the paper
Pay attention to the ones known
The Marilyn Monroes use their wombs as ways to move forward
Fall with the rules to bask in the glory
Bastard child often lost in the story
Sad and unfortunate, but the game's to win

In the middle of the night
Bet your girl goes down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down (And the rain)
Rain come down
Did ya man lay down?

Paid a pretty penny for my peace of mind
Never need a girl to love me, I just need 'em fine
On Parisian time, don't be trippin' on a text back
In another world, Covergirl, but her chest flat
Two page spread in the CR
Think it was for Wang
Can't remember spring or fall, read it on a plane
Long flights playin' with my brain
Long nights, long summers we in Spain
Car color of La Haine
She getting naked under covers for the fame
She don't wanna be another what's-her-name
Brown skin, blonde brain, Etta James
Make it rain in the club
Don't you dream of how it feel to be in love?
What, you drinking? Need a buzz?
Don't drown in the brown, just drown in the sound
When the sun goes down
When the J goes 'round
In the middle of the night
Bet your girl goes down
Rain come down

Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down
Rain come down (And the rain)
Rain come down
Did ya man lay down?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Rain come down)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no (Rain come down)12Embed",https://images.genius.com/50aad9654ca5d87e5ca278c85511792d.1000x1000x1.jpg

This morning I woke up in a fortress of distortion
I'm at war with my emotions, I'm at war with they enforcement
Tryna fight for what's right and got sidetracked
Where your mind at? Never mind that
Can we think in a blink, you swimmin', you sinkin'
You win, you leavin' a head where I've loaded my weapon
I stay with my brethren, I pray for protection
My prey in my sight so I'm doing what's right and not askin' no questions
I wanna be home free, where's one that was lonely?
But I'm ready and waitin'
For my day of salvation, and I'm patient

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I’m coming home now
I’m coming home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

They're looking for saviors, I'm looking for safety
They never gon' break me, take me
Down on my knees, believe I'm never gon' beg or plead
Yeah, I never say never, but I guarantee
Gather my strength, goin' hard in the paint
Paint you a picture, it's put on display
I'm gonna get, they don't give then I take
Can't take me down now
My feet on the ground now
Fight 'til I'm down now
Say it out loud now
Say it out loud, are you ready for war?
You might also like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I’m coming home now
I’m coming home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh20Embed",https://images.genius.com/50aad9654ca5d87e5ca278c85511792d.1000x1000x1.jpg
