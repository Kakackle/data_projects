Make you think about all of the niggas you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju— okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker, get to bustin'

Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood, but she live inside in the valley now
Vacayed in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali (Mm)
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar (Mm)
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car (Mm)
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow (Mm)
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holler back, I'll do ya, beast

Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account (What?)
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount (What?)
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
(I know one thing) Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed, then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, ""Doo, doo,"" I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, ""Mmm, mmm!""
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
You might also like
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real

When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that ""suck my cock"" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
(That wasn't no sample, nigga!)
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass (on your wifey's ass)
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist389Embed",https://images.genius.com/41eca064ad6fb1279eb20a6f546ac054.602x602x1.jpg

Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady takin' shots, but never hurtin' numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout outs all my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
Time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowin', chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumpin' out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smokin' when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer

I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw

The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss

Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless

Aha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off

Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G

Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, ""Tell it to my face""
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits

Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction

Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup, till I'm messed up, like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimpin' hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends
Nigga feeling froggy, then leap in, A$AP niggas finna sneak in
Middle finger to the critics, me and my nigga Skrillex
You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest

Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the opps, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways

Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris', fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill

Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks

Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like ""Fuck them niggas!""
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us

So them R. Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice
Fuck broke, tryna be rich all life
I coulda been a criminal and just rolled dice
My nuts hanging, my top back
Hoes screaming that Pac back
Throwing Westside, bandana tied
A$AP life, got a Pac tat
Harlem world my whole block strapped
Hoes all on my jock strap
My whip white but my top black
And my bitch white but my cock black
Purple drink? Got that
Tell these hoes all to twerk something
Bounce on me bitch, hurt something
Tell her pop that pussy like it's worth something
So shorty, she a stunner and daddy, he a runner
Be that pretty mothafucka, you could call me what you wanna
Cause I'm in love with that ass, she in love with the cash
So she shaking it fast and then making them stacks
And I'm taking it back and I'm taking her back
To the house just to bust in her mouth and I'm kicking her out

And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, ""Whoa""
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, ""I ain't fucking for free,"" but ain't shit I can't afford

She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashin', left her sleepin' on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like, ""Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now your ass is acting""
I'm trippin' off the acid, now your ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music make me bop slower

And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playin' with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, 'cause it's droppin' next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, ""I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden""
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
Uh, that touch your soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothin' at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law

But never mind, I'm fly, you know

Okay, let's get past all the swag trappin' and fashion talkin'
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rappin' talkin'
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughin' off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both actin' awkward?
Jigglin' baby, nah, go 'head, bitch
Ain't nothin' better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell you
Niggas takin' pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the ""Love"" word
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
What's up, bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends?
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh, man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy, bitch, you missed out, #fomo

Now here's a little story I've got to tell
About three bad brothers you know so well
It started way back in history
With Ad-Rock, MCA, (And me) Mike D
Been had a little horsey named Paul Revere
Just me and my horsey and a quart of beer
Riding across the land, kicking up sand
Sheriff's posse's on my tail 'cause I'm in demand
One lonely Beastie I be
All by myself without nobody
The sun is beating down on my baseball hat
The air is getting hot, the beer is getting flat
Looking for a girl, I ran into a guy
His name was MCA, I said, ""Howdy,"" he said, ""Hi""

He told a little story that sounded well-rehearsed
Four days on the run and that he's dying of thirst
The brew was in my hand, and he was on my tip
His voice was hoarse, his throat was dry, he asked me for a sip
He said, ""Can I get some?"", I said, ""You can't get none!""
Had a chance to run, pulled out his shotgun
Quick on the draw, I thought I'd be dead
He put the gun to my head, and this is what he said:
""Now my name is MCA, I've got a license to kill (Yeah)
I think you know what time it is, it's time to get ill (Yeah)
Now what do we have here, an outlaw and his beer? (Uh-huh)
I run this land, you understand? I've made myself clear?""
We stepped into the wind, he had a gun, I had a grin
You think this story's over, but it's ready to begin
You might also like
Now I got the gun, you got the brew
You got two choices of what you can do
It's not a tough decision, as you can see
I can blow you away or you can ride with me
I said, ""I'll ride with you if you can get me to the border
The sheriff's after me for what I did to his daughter""
I did it like this, I did it like that
I did it with a wiffleball bat
So I'm on the run, the cop got my gun
And right about now it's time to have some fun
The King Ad-Rock, that is my name
And I know the fly spot where they got the champagne
We rode for 6 hours, then we hit the spot
The beat was a-bumping, and the girlies was hot
This dude was staring like he knows who we are
We took the empty spot next to him at the bar
MCA said, ""Yippie Yo, you know this kid?""
I said I didn't, but I know he did
The kid said, (""Get ready, 'cause this ain't funny
My name's Mike D, and I'm about to get money""
Pulled out the jammy,  I aimed it at the sky)
He yelled (""Stick 'em up!"") and let two fly
Hands went up, and people hit the floor
He wasted two kids that ran for the door
(""I'm Mike D, and I get respect
Your cash and your jewelry is what I expect"")
MCA was with it, and he's my ace
So I grabbed the piano player, and I punched him in the face
Piano player's out, the music stopped
His boy had beef, and he got dropped
Mike D grabbed the money (MCA snatched the gold)
I grabbed two girlies and a beer that's cold20Embed",https://images.genius.com/28a945e64fc4b3c0e6ce96486f6e4df3.450x450x1.jpg

To Mario C—you can't front on that

Well just plug me in just like I was Eddie Harris
You're eating crazy cheese like you would think I'm from Paris
You know I get fly, you think I get high
You know that I'm gone and I'm-a tell you all why

So tell me who are you dissing; maybe I'm missing
The reason that you're smiling or wyling, so listen
In my head, I just want to take 'em down
Imagination set loose and I'm gonna shake 'em down

Let it flow like a mud-slide
When I get on, I like to ride and glide
I've got depth of perception in my text, y'all
I get props at my mention 'cause I vex, y'all

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want? (what'cha want?)
I get so funny with my money that you flaunt
I said, ""Where'd you get your information from, huh?
You think that you can front when revelation comes?""
You might also like
Yeah, you can't front on that

Well they call me Mike D, the ever-loving man
I'm like Spoonie Gee (whoo ooh), I'm the metropolitician (yeyeyeyeah)
You scream and you holler about my Chevy Impala
But the sweat is getting wet around the ring around your collar

But like a dream I'm flowing without no stopping
Sweeter than a cherry pie with Reddi Whip topping
Going from mic to mic, kickin' it wall to wall
Well I'll be calling out to people like a casting call

Ah, well, it's wack when you're jacked in the back of a ride
With your know, with your flow, when you're out getting by
Believe me, what you see is what you get
And you see me, I'm coming off as you can bet

Well I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time I'm losing my mind; that's right
I said I think I'm losing my mind, this time
This time, I'm losing my mind
Yeah, you can't front on that

But little do you know about something that I talk about
I'm tired of driving, it's due time that I walkabout
But in the meantime, I'm wise to the demise
I've got eyes in the back of my head so I realize

Well I'm Dr. Spock, I'm here to rock, y'all
I want you off the wall, if you're playing the wall
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)

Y'all suckers write me checks and then they bounce
So I reach into my pocket for the fresh amount
See, I'm the long leaner Victor the Cleaner
I'm the illest motherfucker from here to Gardena

Well I'm as cool as a cucumber in a bowl of hot sauce
You've got the rhyme and reason, but got no cause
But if you're hot to trot, you think you're slicker than grease
I've got news for you crews, you'll be sucking like a leech
Yeah, you can't front on that

So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)
I said so what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want (what'cha want)14Embed",https://images.genius.com/28a945e64fc4b3c0e6ce96486f6e4df3.450x450x1.jpg

No sleep 'til
Brooklyn

Foot on the pedal, never ever false metal
Engine running hotter than a boiling kettle
My job ain't a job, it's a damn good time
City to city, I'm running my rhymes
On location, touring around the nation
Beastie Boys always on vacation
Itchy trigger finger, but a stable turntable
I do what I do best because I'm illing and able
Ain't no faking, your money I'm taking
Going coast to coast watch all the girlies shaking
While you're at the job working nine-to-five
The Beastie Boys at the Garden cold kicking it live

No sleep 'til
Another plane, another train
Another bottle in the brain
Another girl, another fight
Another drive all night

Our manager's crazy, he always smokes dust
He's got his own room at the back of the bus
Tour around the world, you rock around the clock
Plane to hotel, girls on the jock
We're trashing hotels like it's going out of style
Getting paid along the way 'cause it's worth your while
Four on the floor, Ad-Rock's out the door
MCA's in the back 'cause he's skeezing with a whore
We got a safe in the trunk with money in a stack
With dice in the front and Brooklyn's in the back
White boys got more rhymes

Limos, arenas, and TV shows
Autographed pictures and classy hoes
Step off, Holmes, get out of my way
Taxing little girlies from here to L.A. 
Waking up before I get to sleep

But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of *jerk*

You gotta fight for your right to party

Your pop caught you smoking, and he said “No way”
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted)

You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight


Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear

And on the cool check-in
Centerstage on the mic
And we puttin' it on wax
It's the new style

Four and three and two and one (What up?)
And when I'm on the mic—the suckers run (Word!)
Down with Ad-Rock and Mike D, and you ain't
And I got more juice than Picasso got paint
Got rhymes that are rough and rhymes that are slick
I'm not surprised you're on my dick (Mike D!)
B-E-A-S-T-I-E
What up, Mike D?
Aw—yeah—that's me
I got franks and pork and beans
Always bust the new routines
I get it, I got it—I know it's good
The rhymes I write—you wish you would
I'm never in training, my voice is not straining
People always biting, and I'm sick of complaining
So I went into the locker room during classes
Went into your locker, and I smashed your glasses
You're from Secaucus—I'm from Manhattan
You're jealous of me because your girlfriend is cattin'

(""There it is"")
Kick it!

Father to many—married to none
And in case you're unaware: I carry a gun (Word)
Stepped into the party, the place was over-packed
Saw the kid that dissed my homeboy, shot him in the back
Man, I had to get a beeper 'cause my phone is tapped
You better keep your mouth shut 'cause I'm fully strapped
I got money in the bank, I can still get high
That's why your girlfriend thinks that I'm so fly
I've got money and juice, twin sisters in my bed
Their father had envy, so I shot him in the head
If I played guitar, I'd be Jimmy Page
The girlies I like are underage (Shh! Check it)
Girls with boyfriends are the kinds I like
I'll steal your honey like I stole your bike
My father, he's jealous 'cause I'm making that green (What up?)
I've got a list of girlies' numbers from the places I've been

(""There it is"")
Kick it!
You wanna know why? Because I'm—
October 31st, that is my date of birth
I got to the party, you know what I did? The Smurf!
Taxin' all the females, from coast to coast
And when I get my fill, I'm chilly most
We ragtag girlies back at the hotel
And then we all switch places when I ring the bell
I chill at White Castle 'cause it's the best
But I'm fly at Fatburger when—when he's—I'm way out west (Check it)
Check; K-I-N-G A-D—whammy!
All the fine ladies, they're on my jammy
Went to the prom—wore the fly blue rental
Got six girlies in my Lincoln Continental
I met a girl at the party, and she started to flirt
I told her some rhymes, and she pulled up her skirt (Check it)
Spent some bank, got a high powered jumbo
Rolled up a wooly—what'd he do?—and I watched Columbo

Let me clear my throat
Kick it over here, baby pop
And let all the fly skimmies feel the beat—
Mmm—drop

Coolin' on the corner on a hot summer's  day
Just me, my posse, and—MCA
A lot of beer, a lot of girls, and a lot of cursin'
.22 automatic on my person
Got my hand in my pocket and my finger's on the trigger
My posse's gettin' big—and my posse's gettin' bigger
Some voices got treble—some voices got bass
We got the kind of voices that are in your face!
Like the bun to the burger—and like the burger to the bun
Like the cherry—to the apple—to the peach—to the plum
I'm the King of the Ave.—and I'm the king of the block
Well, I'm MCA—and I'm the King Ad-Rock
Well, I'm Mike D—I got all the fly juice
On the checkin' at the party on the Forty Deuce
Walking down the block with the fresh fly threads

If you want a doo-doo rhyme, then come see me
I've got the savoir faire with the unique rhymin'
I keep it on and on, it's never quitting time, and
Strictly handheld is the style I go
Never rock the mic with the pantyhose
I strap on my ear goggles, and I'm ready to go
‘Cause at the boards is the man they call the Mario

Timing like a clock when I rock the hip-hop
Top notch is my stock on the soapbox
I've got more rhymes than I've got gray hairs
And that's a lot because I've got my share (oohh, weee)
I've got a hole in my head, and there's no one to fix it
I gotta straighten my thoughts
I'm thinking too much (yeah) sick shit
Everyone just takes and takes, takes, takes, takes
I'll have to step back, I gotta contemplate
Well, I'm like Lee Perry, I'm very on
Rock the microphone, and then I'm gone
I'm like Vaughn Bode, I'm a Cheech Wizard
Never quittin', so won't you listen
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, yes, indeed, it's fun time

'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
'Cause you can't, you won't, and you don't stop
Well, you can't, you won't, and you don't stop

I want to say a little something that's long overdue
The disrespect to women has got to be through
To all the mothers and the sisters and the wives and friends
I want to offer my love and respect to the end
Well, you say I'm twenty-something, then I should be slacking
But I'm working harder than ever, and you could call it macking
So I'm supposed to sit upon my couch just watching my TV
I'm still listening to wax, I'm not using the CD
Well, I'm that kid in the corner
All fucked up, and I wanna, so I'm gonna (yeah)
Take a piece of the pie, why not, I'm not quittin'
Think I'm-a change up my style just to fit in

Listen to the shit because we keep it till dawn
Listen to the Abstract, got it going on
Listen to the ladies, come on and let me spawn
On your eggs, then you go up the river
Listen to the Abstract, that freaky nigga

Now I'm Ad Rock, and I shock, and I tick, and I tock
And I can't stop with the body rock

See, I've got heart like John Starks
Hitting mad sparks
Pass me the mic, and I'll be rockin' the whole park

Well, I'm the M to the C to the A, and it's a must

Nobody's getting any bigger than this

Get it together
Get-get it together

Phone is ringing, oh my God
Get it together, see what's happening


Ad Rock's down with the Ione
Listen to the shit 'cause both of them is bony
Gotta do it like this, like Chachi and Joanie

'Cause she's the cheese, and I'm the macaroni
So why all the fight, why all the fuss?
'Cause ha, I ain't got no dust
Yeah, you know I'm getting silly
Got a Grandma Hazel and a Grandma Tilly
Well, I'm the Grand Royal prez, and I'm also a member
Born on the cusp in the month of November
I do the Patty Duke, in case you don't remember
Well, I freak a funky beat like the shit was in a blender

Well, I'm long gone, word is bond
Don't need a motherfuckin' fool tellin' me right from wrong
I don't think I'm slick, nor do I play like I'm hard
But I'ma drive the lane like I was Evan Bernard

And I be working on my game

Because life is taxing

Gotta get it together

And see what's happening

But I had to do the shit, just let me embark
On the lyric and the noun and the verb
Let me kick the shit off 'cause, yo, I'm not the herb

Well, it's not the herb but the spice with the flavor to spare
The Moog with the funk for your derriere
While we're on that topic, yes, I like to mention

Terrorizing suckers on the seven seas

We got wenches on the benches and bitties with titties
Housing all girlies from city to city
One for all and all for one
Taking out emcees with a big shotgun
All for one and one for all
Because the Beastie Boys have gone AWOL

Now here we go dropping science, dropping it all over
Like bumping around the town like when you're driving a Range Rover
Expanding the horizon and expanding the parameters
Expanding the rhymes of sucka MC amateurs
Naugles, Isaac Newton, a scientific EZ
Ben Franklin with the kite, gettin’ ova with the key
Now rock, shocker the mike of the many times, times the times tables
Rock well to tell, dispel, all of the old fables
Cuz I be dropping the new science and I be kicking the new k-nowledge
An emcee to a degree that you can't get in college
Now the dregs of the Earth and the eggs that I eat
I've got pegs through my hands and one through my feet
Shea Stadium, the radium, E.M.D. squared
Kicked out of the Palladium, 'dja think that I cared?
It's the sounds of science, the sounds of science
Science

Rope-a-Dope!
The newest in new, ""Right up to your face and diss you""
Waxin' and milkin'
All of y'all square heads

Time and money for girls covered with honey
You lie and aspire to be as cunning
Reelin' and rockin' and rollin' B-sized D-cup
Order the Quarter Deluxe, why don'tcha wake up?
My mind is kinda flowing like an oil projector
Had to get up and get the Jimmy protector
Went berserk and worked, and exploded
She woke up in the morning, and her face was coated
Buddy, you study the man on the mic
D, do whatcha like (Huh)
Drunk as a skunk am I from celebration
To peep that freak unique penetration
Well, I figured out who makes the crack, it's
The suckas with the badges and the blue jackets
Professor of science cuz I keep droppin' it
I smell weed 'cause y'all keep packin' it

Yo, what's up? Yo, what's goin' on?

Ahh, yeah

I looked out the window, seen his bald head
Ran to the fridge and pulled out an egg
Scoped him with my scopes, he had no hair
Launched that shot, and he was caught out there
Saw the convertible driving by
I loaded up the slingshot, let one fly
He went for his to find he didn't have one
Put him in check, correct, with my egg-gun
The egg, a symbol of life
I go inside your house and bust out your wife
I pulled out the jammy, he thought it was a joke
The trigger, I pulled - his face, the yolk
Reached in his pocket, took all his cash
Left my man standing with the egg mustache
Suckers, they come a dime a dozen
""When I say dozen, you know what I'm talkin' about, boy""

Yeah, that's right, I'm the Egg Man
Driving around, king of the town (yeah)
Always got my windows rolled down
Ready to throw

I egged the chicken, and then I ate his leg
Riding the trains, in between cars

Sometimes hard-boiled, sometimes runny (Ray)
Comes from a chicken, not a bunny, dummy
People laugh, it's no joke

Up on the roof, in my car, up all night
I'm going through science like Dolemite

We all dressed in black, we snuck up around the back
We began to attack, the eggs did crack on Haze's back

Come Halloween, you know I come strapped
I throw it at a sucker… ""k-pap""
You made the mistake and judge a man by his race
You go through life with egg on your face
Woke up in the morning, peculiar feeling
Looked up and saw egg dripping from the ceiling

Black, White, New York you make it happen
Brownstones, water towers, trees, skyscrapers
Writers, prize fighters and Wall Street traders
We come together on the subway cars
Diversity unified, whoever you are
We're doing fine on the One and Nine line
On the L we're doin' swell
On the number Ten bus we fight and fuss
Cause we're thorough in the boroughs and that's a must
I remember when the Deuce was all porno flicks
Running home after school to play PIXX
At lunch I'd go to Blimpies down on Montague Street
And hit the Fulton Street Mall for the sneakers on my feet
Dear New York, I hope you're doing well
I know a lot's happened and you've been through hell
So, we give thanks for providing a home
Through your gates at Ellis Island we passed in droves

From Hollis Queens right down to Bay Ridge
From Castle Hill to the Lower East Side

Before they moved on down to the Upper West

Just a little something to show some respect
To the city that blends and mends and tests
Since 9/11, we're still livin'
And lovin’, life we've been given
Ain't nothing gonna' take that away from us

What's the time? It's time to buy ale
Peter eater, parking meter, all of the time
If I run out of ale, it's Thunderbird wine
Miller-drinking, chicken-eating, dress so fly
I got friends in high places that are keeping me high
Get down Mike D, and it ain't no hassle
I got the ladies of the eighties from here to White Castle

Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
It's my drum, it's my, hold it now, it's my rhyme

And now it's me, Adam Yauch, in the place to be
All the girls are on me 'cause I'm down with Mike D
I'm down with Mike D, and he ain't no baloney
For real, not phony, O.E. and Rice-a-Roni
I come out at night 'cause I sleep all day
Well, I'm the King Ad-Rock, and he's MCA
Well, I'm cruisin', I'm bruisin', I'm never ever losing
I'm in my car, I'm going far, and dust is what I'm using
Around the way is where I'm from
And I'm from Manhattan, and I'm not a bum
Because you're pud-slapping, ball-flapping, got that ju-ice
My name's Mike D, and I can do that Jerry Lewis

Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Yo, that was real def, man, try that again, man
I like that def stuff, boy

Hip-hoppin', body rockin', doin' the do
Beer drinking, breath stinking, sniffing glue
Belly fillin', always illin', bustin' caps
My name's Mike D, and I write my own snaps
I'm a-peep-show seeking on the Forty-Deuce
I'm a killer at large, and I'm on the loose
Pistol packing, Monkey drinking, no money bum
I come from Brooklyn 'cause that's where I'm from
Cheap-skatin', perpetrating, money-hungry jerk
Every day I drink O.E., and I don't go to work
You drippy-nose knucklehead, you're wet behind the ears
You like men, and we like beers

Hold it now, hit it
Yo, Leroy!
Bust that choco-lotto
What, huh?
Yo man, pass that over here, man, all right
King of the Ave with the def female
You're rhymin' and stealin' with the freshest ale
Kid cooling at the crib watching my TV
Ed Norton, Ted Knight, and Mr. E-D
Pump it up, homeboy, just don't stop
Chef Boyardee, cooling on the pot
I take no slack, 'cause I got the knack
I'm never dusting out 'cause I tossed that crack
The King Ad-Rock, that is my name
Y'all drinking Moet, and we got the champagne
A quarter droppin', going shoppin', buyin' wigs
Surgeon general, cut professor, DJ Thigs

Hold it now, hit it
Hit it

Puttin' songs together ain't no puzzle like Yahtzee
Sending this one out to K-Rob and Rammellzee
Well, let me introduce myself on this cut (Woo)
I'm Ad-Rock, I'm lit like a motherfuck
Well, I'm brewing up rhymes like I was using a still
Kickin' it old school flow like Mike McGill
'Cause Yauch's on the upright, the shit just ain't funny
Got fat bass lines like Russell Simmons steals money
Got clientele, you know I rock well
And then you're on my dick because I'm DFL
Yeah, Mike, 'cause playing the bass is my favorite shit
I might be a hack on the stand up, but I'm working at it
I got my hair cut correct like Anthony Mason
Then I ride the IRT right up to Penn Station (Yeah, huh)
Penn Station, up on 8th Ave
Listen, all y'all, you get the ball back

Put the wax on the table and let the DJ spin it
Well, excuse me, motherfuckers, can I beg your pardon?
I'm gonna see the Knicks at the Madison Square Garden
And like the Knicks, I got game like I worked at Hasbro
On the mic I bug, like I was Prince Jazzbo
Well, the rhymes are stupid to make you go cuckoo
You can't sleep 'cause you're Cindy Lou Who
Down with the Hurra since the Raising Hell Tour
Just listen to his cuts, there's no reason to tell more (Yeah)
Cindy what? I didn't catch the last one
That shit sounded kinda nice, but bust a fast one
Well, I'm not known for my speed raps
So grab the microphone and cut out the claps
Ah, yeah, I like that, shit is kind of rough
I'll grab the microphone and fuck it up
(Aight, woo!)
Well, I might seem out there, just a little deranged
I've got to cool off, catch me on the driving range
Well I'm the ladies' choice like I was JJ Evans
Legalize the weed, and I'll say, ""Thank heavens!""
I'm talking PGA Pro Tour 2
I'm Doctor Beepers on the tv, in my golfing shoes
Aww, pass me an iron, and I'll bust a chip shot
Then you throw me off the green 'cause I'm strictly hip-hop (Yeah)
I'll grab the tee, I'll tee off
I'll grab the golf clubs, and I'm off, I'm Audi, so check me
I've got the Timbos on my toes when I'm on the green
I've got the custom-made boots with the spikey things
I'm working on my driving 'cause I'm going pro
I've got the funky fly golf gear from head to toe
Yeah, the B-Boys makin' with the freak freak 'cause it's unique unique

Mm, mm, mm
Aw yeah, I'm with this
I'm just gonna sit here laid back to this nice mellow beat, you know
And drop some smooth lyrics
'Cause '88 time to set it straight, know what I'm sayin'?
And ain't no half-steppin'
Word, I'm ready

Rappers steppin' to me, they wanna get some
But I'm the Kane, so, yo, you know the outcome
Another victory, they can't get with me
So pick a B.C. date 'cause you're history
I'm the authentic poet to get lyrical
For you to beat me, it's gonna take a miracle
And steppin' to me, yo, that's the wrong move
So what you on, Hobbs, dope or dog food?
Competition, I just devour
Like a pit bull against a Chihuahua
'Cause when it comes to bein' dope, hot damn
I got it good, now let me tell you who I am
The B-I-G D-A-double-D-Y K-A-N-E
Dramatic, Asiatic, not like many
I'm different, so don't compare me to another
'Cause they can't hang, word to the mother
At least not with the principal in this pedigree
So when I roll on you rappers, you better be
Ready to die because you're petty
You're just a butter knife, I'm a machete
That's made by Ginsu, wait until when you
Try to front, so I can chop into
Your body, just because you tried to be basin'
Friday the 13th, I'ma play Jason
No type of joke, gag, game, puzzle or riddle
The name is Big Daddy, yes, Big, not little
So define it, here's your walkin' papers, sign it
And take a walk as the Kane starts to talk, 'cause
You might also like
Ain't no half-steppin'

Ain't no half-steppin'

Down the road
My rhymes are so dope and the rappers be hopin'
To sound like me, so soon, I'll have to open
A school of emceein' for those who wanna be in
My field and court, then again, on second thought
To have MCs comin' out soundin' so similar
It's quite confusin' for you to remember the
Originator, and boy, do I hate a
Perpetrator, but I'm much greater
The best, oh yes, I guess, suggest the rest
Should fess, don't mess or test your highness
Unless you just address with best finesse
And bless the paragraphs I manifest
Rap prime minister, some say sinister
Non-stoppin' the groove until when it's
The climax and I max, relax and chill
Have a break from a take of me actin' ill
Brain cells are lit, ideas start to hit
Next the formation of words that fit
At the table I sit, makin' it legit
And when my pen hits the paper, aw shit
I stop and stand strong over MCs
And devour with the power of Hercules
Or Samson, but I go further the length
'Cause you could scalp my Cameo and I'll still have strength
And no, that's not a myth, and if you try to riff or get with
The man with the given gift of gab
Your vocab, I'll only ignore
Be sleepin' on your rhymes 'til I start to snore
You can't awake me, or even make me
Fear you, son, 'cause you can't do me none
So, think about it if you're tryna go
When you wanna step to me, I think you should know that
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Ain't no half-steppin'
I'm the Big Daddy Kane
Down the road

I appear right here and scare and dare
A mere musketeer that would dare to compare, put him in the rear
Back there where he can't see clear
Get a beer, idea or near stare, yeah
So on to the wannabe competition
Tryin' to step to me, must be on a mission
Up on the stage is where I'ma get you at
You think I'm losin'? Tsk, picture that

Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Ain't no half-steppin'
Mister Cee, step to me
Get on— Get on down
Get on down— down
Get on— Get on down
Down
Get on— Get on down
Get on—
Get on— Get on—
Down— (Look) Down— (Look) Down— (Look) Down—

The name is Big Daddy, you know, as in your father
So when you hear a def rhyme, believe that I'm the author
I grab the mic and make MCs evaporate
The party people say, ""Damn, that rapper's great""
The creator, conductor of poetry
Et cetera, et cetera, it ain't easy bein' me
I speak clearly so you can understand
Put words together like Letter Man
Now that's dictation, proceedin' to my innovation
Not like the other MCs that are an imitation
Or an animation, a cartoon to me
But when I'm finished, I'm sure that you are soon to see
Reality, my secret technique
Because I always speak with mentality
I put my title in your face, dare you to base
And if you try and come get it, yo, I'ma show you who's with it
So if you know like I know, instead of messin' around
Play like Roy Rogers and slow down
Just give yourself a break, or someone else will take your title
Namely me, because I'm homicidal
That means murder, yes, I'm out to hurt a-
-nother MC that try to get with me
I'll just break him and bake him and rake him and take him
And mold him and make him hold up the peace sign

Well excuse me, take a few minutes, to mellow out
Big Daddy Kane is on the mic and I'mma tell about
A minimum length, of rhymes of strength
And power, so listen to the man of the hour
Flow and go to a slow tempo and you know
Sing ho, swing low, then yo the show
Will go on, as I perform
Transformin' on stage like a Decepticon
But I'm not animated like a cartoon
I'm for real, shootin' lyrics like a harpoon
Across the crowd, the listeners, the spectators
So let's groove with the smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""

The B-I-G, D-A-double-D-Y-K-A-N-E
I'm good and plenty, servin' many and any
Competition, wishin' for an expedition
I'm straight up dissin' and dismissin', listen
Rappers act so wild, and love to profile
Frontin' hard but they ain't got no style
I give nightmares to those who compete
Freddy Krueger, walkin' on Kane Street
Confuse and lose abuse and bruise the crews
Who choose to use my name wrong, they pay dues
Destruction from the exterminator
But in a calm manner, cause I'm a smooth operator
You might also like
""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Now girls step up to this
One simple kiss, and it's over, miss
Sold to nice dreamers, high as the price seem
Girlfriend, you been scooped like ice cream
So just swing or fling a gathering, try to cling
Cause It's a Big Daddy Thing
And I'm lovin' 'em right, word is bond
So just play Marvin Gaye and Let's Get It On
I make it real good like Dr. Feelgood
To make sure that my point is understood
That when it comes to this there's none greater
Sincerely yours... the smooth operator

""Cause I'm so smooth...""

Now ain't that the pot callin' the kettle black
Sayin' I'm a new jack, you need to be smacked
The smooth way I say 'em and the way I display 'em
To make them sound different in a way that's gifted
And hey I'm, makin sure every lyric is done fine
And I make one line, bright as the sunshine
Attack you like Robitussin on a cough
If you know like I know -- step off
Competition, I'mma get rid of
You can't get a bit of, so just consider
A break or rest, vacation, hibernation
And make way for my smooth operation
I'm a smooth operator
""Cause I'm so smooth...""
Ahhhhh yeahhh, and you don't stop

I don't play, I'm from the hill where shit is real
And I'll be on your ass like bugs on a windshield
So bring your grip or you can think twice
Cause I got more rhymes than a five pound bag of rice
I'm hitting hard, oh word, I'm gon' rock it
Once the shit drops, that's dough to the pocket
I cut hair and you still can't get no part
You couldn't deal with Scoob if we was playing cards
But if I got beef then it's time for code red
My gun is like a ho, it be taking mad niggas to bed
So hurry up and skedaddle
Even if you join the army, you still couldn't battle
So where you from? England, you somebody great?
You burning Scoob, ""I don't think so mate""
I got the style that get you open like a bag of smoke
I'll have your friends saying ""Ah man, that shit is dope""
Leave me alone when I'm rocking on the microphone
And play like E.T. and phone your black ass home
Yo Sauce, if you're down with the groove
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove

Hey, here I come with a slick rap, tic-tac-toe
When I flip tracks, so gimme my dick, back
I flow to it and through it, if you ever need to wonder

I write my own with bigger hope, drink of Scope
Wrote what I figured, nope, damn you dig a nigga doe
Rhymes too drastic, bastard, pull hookers like elastic
NBA style, fantastic
No time to bite, but I just might, tonight
I write left-handed cause I like to grab my dick with my right
Who could ever say that I don't get plenty play
Win lose or draw, I'm booking whores, anyway
As I get ready I'm steady if I go crazy I'd take Eddie
If I was Fred, I think I'd have to bone Betty
Sucking and lucking, hey, niggas I'm ducking, nay
Nada no never meaning ain't no motherfuckin way
Rappers get gassed come on and get fast
Try to get past when I blast, and you can hand over your ass
One line and that's fear
Rappers get so damn pussy they gotta go for a pap smear
So Shyheim, if you're down with the groove
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove

I spark the mic like weed that's in a cipher
And I get girls open like a reggae song by Tiger
So check me out, as I flip this here track kid
And make mad noise like a Metallica record
I'm psycho, a villain to the styles I be killing
When I'm thrusted, and all competition gets dusted
Cause I rock the world from U.S.A. to Asia to Russia
If your shit stinks I'mma flush ya, then bust ya
Like a crazy man from Cali son
My jams be packed like a Farrakhan rally, what?
You know my style, I put the F in effin foul
The Rugged Child lock shit down like Rikers Isle
And got more girls than a trailer load with Shabba
More Super than Cat, I'm the punani Don Dada
So Big Daddy, if you're down with the groove my man
Get on the mic and won't ya show and prove
Now tell me who is the man?
With the high-potent lyrics no rapper can ever stand
And stepping to me, thinking I can be touched?
Not even Michael Jordan'll gamble that much, yo
I get down on it and give it to rappers that even act like they want it
I come for your title kid, run it!
Or else get hit with the ultimate, too legit skit
Ahh yeah, that's that shit
Drop lyrics on ya, strong as ammonia
That'll dethrone ya, scorn ya, joan ya, I tried to warn ya
You was wack since I known ya, fake as a cubic zirconia
What I just shown ya, real lyrics doggone ya
Look inside my rap book at every text my man
And see that I got, more essays than the Mexican
The Messiah that's feared great, leaving rappers in a weird state
Scared straight, for their prepared fate
Strong as an elephant, intelligent, compelling and elegant
So well in it with every single element
And competition gets none
If I was wearing pantyhose you still couldn't give me no run
I see the way you're trying to get to me
But with that speech impedi-ment, man you gotta come better G
You're hitting all the wrong switches troop begin again
Mumble mouth rappers couldn't last a minute with
The non-resistable, non-competible
No No No I'm not saying I'm the best
I'm just saying I'm fucking incredible
And let's just make one more thing understood
That if I fart on a record, trust me nigga it'll sound good
So Jay-Z, if you're down with the groove, my mellow
Get on the mic it's time to show and prove
One checking it two, checking it three
Check out the J, check out the A, check out the Y, check out the Z
Aight G!

And these nuts if you rappers trying to see me
I'm buckwild with styles, ta-dow
I've been in it running a hundred miles I'm well endowed, baby gal
Uhh, the greatest nigga to touch it, you niggas can't fuck with
The, incredible skills of the G from Brooklyn, big up kid
And ain't no eating me up, you fast fuckin with jigga
I'm like Prince jeans, I bring the ass out a nigga
When I rock it it's in the pocket, baby mop it don't knock it
Till you try it, once you start, you can't stop it
I'm the cocky breed, I'm dope like poppy seed
I live one rent from besides that be
Between get off my dick and stop jockin me
When I bust a rhyme you're diggin the sound
I know you loving the way it's, goin down baby
So Ason huh, if you're down with the groove, why don't ya
Get on the mic and show and prove
Come on
Wu-Tang killa bees on a swarm
Rain on your college ass, disco dorm
Slippery when wet and don't you ever forget
You couldn't get a flick, of the hype outfit
Because the way that I dress this style mad wild
Enough to make a crowd of women scream ""Ow!""
Whether at a party or just in bed
All thoughts on Ason, keep that in your head
Yuh, my beats are funky and my rhymes are spunky
Sometimes I'll be like ""Well god damn what's the recipe?""
I don't know, I ask my momma she don't know
She says ""Go ask your goddamn father!""
It's all about me in the place to be
Niggas think they all that, yo, that shit is G
Mad game and it's a motherfucking shame
How many enemies wanna claim the name
Of Ason, who carries on like a manager

Like an apple, like a cherry, like a peach, like a plum
Let me get off the virgin before I cum
Pick up my pants and thump and thump
I think I'll call up Tootie, she'll give me some
Watch out, watch out I'm drippin' live scum
I say damn, I love the way I make my posse roll-a
'Specially when the hoochie's on birth control-a
Lift her up just like a pick-up truck
Then I sat her down and we started to fuck
Made whoopie, made whoopie, made whoopie, yo
I hope this time I don't make a cookie

What's in my pants'll make you see reality
And if you wanna see a smooth black Casanova
Bend over!
Cuz I don't half-step when it comes to broads
The K-A-N-E'll go the whole nine yards
There's no time for coversation my dear
(Ohh!) Is all I wanna hear
So let's make a move, as I get smooth
Cuz the purpose I serve is to soothe
I'm tall, dark and handsome and all that junk
Even white girls be sayin' ""Ooh, Kane's a hunk!""
Even Puerto Rican girls be callin' me papi
Some try to copy, but they look sloppy
So imitators that wanna step to a

And when I used to be with Scott, I was a Super-Ho
But now I'm coolin' with Kane and Greg N-I-C-E
And if you girlies want my tip they gotta pay a fee
I love bonin', and all my friends they will agree
That when it comes to pimpin' hoes, it ain't easy
First name, Smooth, last name, B
When I'm bonin' a girl, I make her feel heavenly
I like to make 'em wait, and then make 'em beg
And when I take off my clothes, then I form a third leg
They rub it with oils and suck it with ice
Now I'm sweating, my mind is in paradise

Buyin' drinks for the ladies, money I was blowin'
Right in front of me, hmm, not even knowin'
A brown-skinned cutie; big, plump booty
Nametag earrings readin' off ""Tootie""
Bullseye, bing, the girl of my dreams
From my eyesight that was what it seemed
I said, uh, ""Come a little bit closer""
To Scoob that night, choice guy, she said ""Hi
Hi, hi, I've really been wantin' to meet you
I just got paid and I'll be very glad to treat you
How 'bout dinner, a Salisbury steak?""
I said, ""Sorry Honey-Dip, but I already ate""
So I nudged the other girlies off my shoulder
Went for Tootie 'cause the girl was much older
East to the Benz, I slowly walked
Clearing out my throat so I cold start my smooth talk
Sex in my mind, I was sure of it
I wanted to tax that ass like the government

Let it roll, get bold, I just can't hold
Back or fold 'cause I'm a man with soul
In control and effect, so what the heck?
Rock the discotheques and this groove is what's next
Attack, react, exact, the mack'll move you with
A strong song, as long as you groove to this
I keep the crowd loud when you're hype
Do damage onstage and injure the mic
As I shoot the gift, MCs stand stiff
While my rhymes stick to you like Skippy and Jif
Feel my blood fist or my death kiss
The rap soloist, you don't want none of this
Supreme in this era, I reign with terror
When I grab the mic, believe you're gonna hear a
Fascinatin' rhyme as I enchant them
So let's all sing the Big Daddy anthem
Go with the flow, my rhymes grow like an Afro
I entertain again and Kane'll never have no
Problem, I can sneeze, sniffle, or cough
E-e-e-even if I stutter, I'ma still come off
'Cause rappers can't understand the mics I rip
They sure enough ain't equipped, that's why they got flipped
But my apparatus is up to status
Don't ask who's the baddest, of course, that is
The maker, breaker, taker, my rhymes ache the head
Put it to bed, so watch what's said
Save the bass for the pipe and rearrange your tone
Or take a loss and be forced in the danger zone
'Cause I get ill and kill at will
Teachin' a skill that's real, you're no thrill
So just stand still and chill as I build
Science I drill until my rhymes fill
Your head up
Don't even get up
The teacher is teachin', so just shut up

I can't hold it back
Set it off
I can't hold it back
Set it off
I can't hold it back
Set it off
I can't hold it back
Now break loose

Rappers, take a step back, or you will soon regret that
You ever had to confront me and you can bet that
I come correct, perfect, in full effect
Disconnect, dissect, eject as I wreck shop
Stand in command with the clan
Caravan or van, we go man for man and
Without further ado or any delay
Mister Cee as we say, call him the DJ
Mad Money Murf with the triple M
Smooth the barber keepin' my flat-top trim
Scoob Lover my brother, Scrap Lover my other
Dancin' with the crew, so allow the boys to smother
The floor, and endure just for your pleasure
As the microphone lord proceeds to get raw
Acrobatic, Asiatic, rap fanatic
I get dramatic and rhymes start flowin' automatically from me
So don't play me, obey me
When asked, ""Who's the best?"", you better say me
I'm sendin' sucker MC's headin' north
And if you still want some, set if off
For you to cope is just a wish and a hope
And if you are what you eat, then feed me dope
'Cause I'm just about as dope as dope can get
Ultimate, legit, Kane is a perfect fit
The king of my kingdom, completin' a cypher
The lyrics I bring them keeps the crowd hyper
As I release the masterpiece
The groove will never cease until Kane says, ""Peace""
So, maestro, yo, hit it
Big Daddy Kane's about to come with it 'cause
I can't hold it back
Set it off
I can't hold it back
Set it off
I can't hold it back
Set it off
I can't hold it back
Now break loose
I can't hold it back

Now I just wanna say what's up to my man Botch, can't forget D

Come, get some, you little bum
I take the cake, but you can't get a crumb
From the poetic, authentic, superior
Ultimate, and all that good shit
I'm the original Asiatic, acrobatic
There you have it, now get dramatic
Creatin' drama when I'm on the scene
And I pack 'em in mean, like Bruce Springsteen
I profile a style that's mild and meanwhile
Put on trial a rap pile to exile
Make you tumble and stumble, in a rumble just crumble
And I'm still calm and humble
You need another helpin' hand to swing on
I stand alone, but still you gotta bring on
Your Batman and Robin, Cagney and Lacey
Starsky and Hutch, but they still can't face me
And if may make this one thing here clear
That's for you not to come near, period!
For I ain't buggin' or delirious
My swift tongue's like a sword, that's how severe it is
And I can slice and dice a Fisher-Price MC
That thought he was nice into Minute Rice
Single-handed, I ain't with that band stuff
'Cause Cee'll scratch a record like flakes of dandruff
And the mic I ravage, not like a savage
But in my own way of doin' damage
As I design the genuine line
Now, who flat top rules in '89?

Take two of the man with soul that you probably know
Deadly as Scarface, but bright as the Cosby Show
Don't attack rappers, but make everyone hush
They step to me, but can't stop the bum rush
I make material rich and imperial
The unique technique I speak is all original
You like to sag and drag and gag
Same old same old, but papa's got a brand new bag
So put the mic down, boy, you can't work it
Due to wack lyrics that's 'bout to short-circuit
So toss the sauce across to the boss
No remorse, you lost, with force I cause a holocaust
First I caught ya, then put ya through torture
You moved wrong, my son, so I taught ya
Just like a guardian, now put your body in
The mood to groove with the smooth way that I'm partyin'
Competition may find it spectacular
Scheme and fiend to take a bite like Dracula
And waste the taste, 'cause ain't no sugar here
So come near if you dare, you Booga Bear
You start hallucinatin' like magic
The wrath gets tragic, but Kane won't have it
'Cause you tried to juice me when you're bluffin'
Slowed the pace, so I had to start rushin'
So pick a B.C. date 'cause you're history
Here comes Kane, Scoob, Scrap, Jay, and Mister Cee
And this is one thing to us we ain't new to
The crew'll cast a spell on the crowd just like voodoo
I'm the man you can't hold back
And all competition appears to be weak
I meant to say wack, a vision of blur
Just to think of them competing, I say, ""Huh!""

Funky!
Ready?
Funky! Funky! Ahhh...
One two, one two
We came here to do the motherfuckin' do
You and the crew
Got my man Marley Marl in the house
Can't forget my man, Lik, y'all in the house
Got Fric and Frac in the house
Hey-hey-hey, you got Big Daddy Kane in the house
Juice Crew in the house
That's right
And my name is the Biz Markie
And we gonna rock a little something like this...
One, two, whatcha gonna do?
I say yes, yes y'all, to the beat, all
Party-havin' people guaranteed to be like havin' a ball
H-h-h-hey, we gonna do a little somethin' like this, I say...

I'm the rap promoter, I start to motor
Tour from New York to South Dakota
Drink ginger ale or root beer soda
Never get the girls with the underarm odor
Put me on water, I'm a good floater
When I run for prez, you best be a voter
Once knew a girl by the name of Rhoda
I watched Star Wars just to see Yoda
Or R2-D2 drivin' down the BQ
When I buy franks, I make sure they're Hebrew
When I entertain, and love to treat you
Love to see a girl in a nightie that's see-through
Take her to the crib, turn on the Beta
Watch a good flick by Arnold Schwarzenegger
Maybe ""Commando"" or ""The Terminator""
Peace, party people, ha ha, see you later
Big Daddy, ha ha, my man my mellow
Get on the mic 'cause you know you eat Jell-O
You might also like
Check it out, y'all
You don't stop, keep on
Well, it's the Kane in the flesh, of course I'm fresh
Oh, you thought that I was rotten? Huh, I beg your pardon
To me, gettin' paid and gettin' busy fall together
So a man of my ambiance... never!
Could I be weak, why, I'm rather unique
I got style, flavor, grace, and plus a different technique
That I be usin' and not many can manage
So a brother like me, I do damage
Just by pickin' up the mic to go solo
I cold turn a party on out, and oh, yo
I get physical, mystical, very artistical
Givin' party people somethin' funky to listen to
That's why the other MC's can't swing long
I stomp 'em out just like I was King Kong
Steppin' on roaches, I get ferocious
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
I go on and on and on and
Until the bright Shirley Murdock morning
'Cause I'mma pimp, hear the primp, yes, the emp-
-eror, bringin' much terror in your era
I'm ready, willin' and I'm able, so bust a move
Never use a barbershop, I got my homeboy Smooth
Coolin' out with the clippers right around the way
To keep my fresh Cameo cut every day
Like that, y'all, it's like that, y'all
It's like thata-the-that, it's like that, y'all
'Cause I'm the prosecutor, takin' a stand
And, I'm cross-examinin' you, my man
The judge and jury, releasin' my fury
The verdict that I reach for you is rather blurry
You see, the name Kane is superior to many people
It means King Asiatic Nobody's Equal
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
And if mics were a gun, I'd be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game, I'd be MVP
Most Valuable Poet on the M-I-C
Or if rap was a school, I'd be the principal
Aw, fuck it! The Kane is invincible
To be specific, I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
It's a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good, apparently you lack this
So in turn, sit back and learn
Listen close, this is for your own concern
Let me show you exactly how it's properly done
Lights, camera, action!
A rap pro, do a show, good to go, also
Cameo afro, Virgo, domino

So out of the mercy of Allah
And the law, written in our nature
We call an individual into existence
And when that individual come
I make no apologies for what I'm about to say

Rough, rugged and real, you're on standstill
To obey okay so let the man build
Words of rapture that you have to capture
And I just slapped ya
With the hand full of literature
That's dope def fresh hype choice smooth and raw
Rappers I replace, rub out and erase
Competition you must be on freebase
Smoking or choking, bound to be broken
Man, get your damn hands off the mic that I'm choking!
'Cause I got a stranglehold
You’re still cold on parole for the role you stole
Rhymes that you yell out, but you did sell out
Crossed-over, lost over here, now get the hell out
I'm not a pop star, rock'n'roller
I'm a rebel, blessed, able to hold a
Mic like a hammer and drop grammar
Treat a rapper like a wrestler and body slam him
Those who dispute get treated just like a prostitute
They get the boot and played like a flute
So just play mute, don't even whisper
Open your mouth to speak and I'm diss ya
Ragtag and dog, put you in the morgue
Because you're petty confetti and not ready to Rock Steady
In other words you're Half-Steppin'
Tiptoeing, get going because my weapon
Is not a nine, an Uzi or a shotgun
But when it come to hype rhymes I got one
Just like the album is still the same
Long Live the Kane, ain't a damn thing changed
I still get ill and kill at will and build the skill
To fill your grill so don't tell me you're real
We sample beats, you sue and try to fight us
*tchk* Man, you still be home with arthritis
If we didn't revive 'em, bring back alive
Old beats that we appreciated, you wouldn't survive
You'd be another memory to us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So understand, the way that I live
That's positive and the message I got to give
It's a benefit for you and me
I'm talking bout P.E.A.C.E
The chosen one that has turned a new leaf
I got gold teeth, and they don't chew beef
No pork on my fork, strictly fish on my dish
The Kane falling victim? *tchk* Sucker, you wish
I flow like water, slaughter
Put you out of order, floored ya!
Rappers are ragging and tagging and snagging and bragging
To be on the bandwagon, but I'm the Last Dragon
With the knack to attract the pack
So just get back, I'm Young, Gifted and Black

And just go with the flow you know
In the place to be with my man Marley Marl
Sending this out to Divine Force
Can't forget my main man Heavy D
And to my good brothers EPMD
And to my man Ice-T over on the West Coast
Can't forget Kool Moe Dee, Busy Bee, MC Lyte, the Audio Two

Do you know, what you're goin through?
Do you like this style of rap that I'm showin you?
The way I flow for you.. do you know?

Yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, check the rhyme to the song
Uhh, aw yeah baby c'mon
Ah baby baby c'mon, and check the rhyme to the song
One double nine to the four, gotta keep 'em on the floor
And put some real lyrics back in the hardcore
What I'm used to hearin', I can't believe it's gone
But now just like a grill inside Burger King, the beef is on
When I come, rappers begin to speak in degrees
I even make Sisters With Voices weak in the knees
So run for your lives, Kane with the pen
Is like Freddy with the glove full of knives
Who wanna test these skills, come see how it feels
I pull you one verse, if that don't kill I got refills
You can't do me none, kid you gets nothin'
If my rhymes was in Braille, you still couldn't touch em
Man, I'm a bad cat, my style of rap is mad fat
And you know, sometimes it's so sad that
Rappers today be comin' as the gangster rhyme type
And be so soft, they wouldn't even kill time right
Here's the news, you lettin' the word hardcore be misused
You ain't never paid dues
Be for real, you ain't tough yet
The razor bumps on your throat is the only thing makin' you a ruffneck
Your whole image is a dammmmn sham
I'm glad in this business I didn't forget who I am
I always remain the Kane inside a battle
Never to walk in anyone's shadow
I do my own thing, I do a thing of my own
And with my competition I let it be known
That battles I don't lose none, boy you get bruised son
Six million ways to die -- choose one!
My rap style is like a poisonous vemon
We might as well be havin' sex, the way that I put it in 'em
And do I crush MCs? are you kiddin me?
If rappers were grapes, I'd have a whole wine distillery
So, I bring it to your face, with the bass, then I blow
A rapper off the map, with the rap, when I flow
Then hit you with the skill that is ill, and I know
That all of this is good to go, 'cause yo
That's the way the flavor always come
The rhymes they flow accordin' to the drum
The Brooklyn style cause that is where I'm from
You want the funk so let me give you some
I flip on the flow on the track, just like that
Amazin' the people the style of the rappin', is quite fat
I'm lickin' the lyrics and shootin' the gat, on the mic, black
And this is for all of the rappers that like, and they bite that
The Smooth Operator is mellow with the saxophone
Settin' the tone that make the girls relax and moan
'Cause all the ladies I'm givin' 'em lots of love
Hittin' more skins than a boxing glove, good God
The girls treat me like the drummer and give me some
From tall to short to thick, even the slimmy ones
Watch out Goldie! Gimme a forty ounce of Olde E
And none of you players can control me
You get the chance to see a true mack man
With skills to pay the bills, to make more stacks than
Taller than anybody else's stacks it seem
Cause the Kane get more paper than a fax machine
The unforgettable, rhymes are too poetical
Keep rappers in order more than letters put alphabetical
And I hope the record consumers don't believe the magazine rumors
'Cause Kane is makin' a comeback, like Pumas
I get rough G, and set it on your whole damn company
And Bogart, like my name was Humphrey
When I get through, there'll be no more of them
As many rappers I burnt, I should open a crematorium
I make mad MC's give me my P's
If you try to disrespect, kid you can get these
N.U.T.s, like the U.N.V.s
I leave you down on your knees, down on your knee-hees!
Razor sharp, many ways of art
Source rings the chart, people praise the God
For kickin' the flows so fantastic and this one here

 Yo
 I ran into a young lady Maliya last night
 Word?
 Must have been her husband's payday
 Heheh
 because she bought me this here brand new
Diamond link that you see me with on
 Mmm
 Smooth, you knowhatI'msayin? You know why?
 Why Kane?
 Cause I get the job done

I work
I work
I work
I work.. baby!
I work
I work
I work
I work.. baby!

The question at hand, is how do I love thee?
I count the ways but girls don't shove me
One by one you can come and caress me
Undress and molest me but you can't posess me
Because I love a young lady that's beautiful
But one that's smart for me, is more suitable
In other words, to make it simple and plain
You gotta have a brain in order to be Ms. Kane
But in the case of not becomin my lady
I take em eight to eighty, dumb crippled and crazy
Crisp and clean with no caffeine
And a pair of spandex or either tight jeans
Couldn't believe the ones with the Chinese cuts
But I'll take 'em with the weave hangin down to they butts
And if you step up in a large sum
Like Martin Luther King, I Shall Overcome
I get the job done

Some of you ladies make moves too quick
And settle down, without havin a large pick
Rushed into becoming some poohbutt's wife
And no longer do you enjoy, the married life
Well, I let you know this is a brand new year
So never fear, the Big Daddy is here
To do things in places your husband wouldn't
And do certain things he probably just couldn't
Let me sneak into your life, like a thief in the night
Lick your body all over and squeeze you real tight
Nibble all over your ear and give your back a massage
You'll say, ""Oooh I like it,"" just like DeBarge (how large)
Smooth and mild I'll make you smile, honey child
Then hit the lights and get buckwild
And when I turn her back on, you'll have to say
Like Calgon, please take me away
So when your main course is doin nothin for ya
Just look at me as a tasty side order
That came into your life and brought a thrill
Cause any husband won't, I'm a neighbor who will, get the job done..
I work
I work
I work
I work.. baby!

T.R., take it to the bridge, uhh!

Here's a perfect description of me
Six foot one, and dark and lovely
And if they're sayin black is beautiful, it's true not phony
I'm Browner than Bobby so won't you be my Tenderoni
And get a whiff of this nymphomaniac
An up-to-date mack that's ready to attack
And prove that I'm a pro and far from a rookie
Ain't no hair on my chest, but I'm one tough cookie
Whoever said you had to be one-hundred percent
Masculine in order to be in?
I'd rather be more subtle and smooth and SOOTH
Girl, you won't disapprove
And I promise that you'll never forget
Hmmmmmmmmmmm, now what's a title to fit me?
A champ like Tyson, a Captain like Kirk, no
Employee of the Month, cause yo, I do work
The K-A-N-E is on the J-O-B

Mmm.. ohh yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, ohh yeah
Allow me to introduce myself
As the Big Daddy Kane
A smooth lover from around the way
That's bound to drive any bitch insane

Well Dolemite is my name
And rappin and tappin is my game

Oh yeah? Well me tell you somethin Mr. Dolemite
The shit you talkin years ago, I could see
But it's the 90's now and rap is all about me

Listen.. when it comes down to rappin
I was THROUGH with it before you learned what to do with it
I'm the KING so I'm stakin my claim
In the rappin game
Y'know? For all players, I am the speaker
I'm also known as the hot pussy seeker
When it comes down to ridin up and down in some pussy
I make it weaker
Also it gets a little deeper
I was walkin down Broadway the other day
An old lady came my way
She said, ""I'll be glad when you 'come 18
I'm gonna give you a funkin like you ain't never seen!""
I said, ""LADY! Why wait for so much time to pass?
I've been WANTIN to tear up yo' old gray ass""
So I pulled out my dick
It was so shiny it looked like it was painted
The ho took one look and damn near fainted
I stuck it in the bitch and the bitch began to shout
That, ""Oh Mr. Dolemite, take that motherfucker OUT!""

Well you ain't sayin nothin slick to a can of oil
I walked barefoot from New York to Dallas
Won for Pimp of the Year at the Caesar's Palace
Made a big snowstorm on the 4th of July
And drunk the waters in the Atlantic Ocean til that shit was dry
I was makin money before Washington was put on a bill
And I kicked Jack's ass and took his ho Jill
I'm the one who broke the bull's back
And made people say FUCK McDonald's and call ME the Big Mac

Why you long lanky motherfucker
You ain't nothin but a sucker!
I was born in a barrel of butcher knives
Shot in the ass with two Colt .45's
I've been slapped by a bear and bit by an eel
I chew up railroad iron, and shit out steel!
I jumped in the ocean and swallowed a whale
Handcuff lightning and throw THUNDER's ass in jail

Why you ignorant decrepit motherfucker
Let me tell you somethin
I'm the one that put the M in mackin
Because when you did it you was only actin
I made pimpin a full time job
So bitches wouldn't have to go out and rob
I made the streets of New York hot as a SAUNA
And hung a Home Sweet Ho sign on every corner
Yes I'm the player of all players and the mack of all macks
Give a headache to Excedrin and knock the SHIT out of Ex-Lax
Why you insecure no business barn junkyard
Rat soup eatin motherfucker!!
It was in the early 1960's when I originated my pimpin game
I was callin whores jive-ass bitches
And pimps - sucker-ass lames
KANE, before you can take my reign
You gotta cook me a chicken and a half a day
Walk from New York to Los Angeles and throw the bones away
You gotta be BORN BLIND and cannot see
Yo' bitches have the POCKS in the ass so bad they can't even pee
Ride a bald eagle a million feet in the AIR
And get out and do the runnin man while you up there
Have the Mumps and the Asiastic Flu
And the Crabs around yo' ass start singin the Yankee Doodle Doo!

The wrath of Kane, taking over your circumference
Destroying negativity and suckers that come with
The weak, the wack, the worse, the poor
I thrash, bash, clash, mash... and then more
Blow up the scenery, I reign supremacy
You need a savior to save ya so lean on me
I'm playing rappers like a haunted ghost
And stomp 'em out like a wanted roach
I slay my prey and they decay, I blow away and throw away
So go away, 'cause I don't play
Attacking like a psychopath, breaking rappers in half
So feel the wrath
Of Kane

""The name is Big Daddy""
""Here to bring trouble to""

The man at hand to rule and school and teach
And reach the blind to find their way from A to Z
And be the most and boast the loud and proud
The Kane'll reign your domain
(Yeah Kane!)
The heat is on so feel the fire
Come off the empire, on a more higher
Level than def, one step beyond dope
The suckers all scope and hope to cope but nope
'Cause I can never let 'em on top of me
I play 'em out like a game of Monopoly
Let 'em speed around the board like an Astro
Then send 'em to jail for trying to pass Go
Shaking 'em up, breaking 'em up, taking no stuff
But it still ain't loud enough
So Mister Cee, let the volume grow so I can flow
Now yo
Juice Crew's the family, Slick Rick's a friend of me
And Doug E. Fresh, Stet, KRS and Public Enemy
Blahzay Blah, you know who you are
The red, black and green, the sun, moon and star
Knowledge of self is being taught here on after
Peace in the name of I Self Lord and Master
I come to teach and preach and reaching each
With the speech every leech I'll impeach
Drop science and build with math
And the dumb, deaf and blind'll feel the wrath
Of Kane

Marley Marl, break it down!
Bring it back, Cee

Line by line, chapter after chapter
Like a pimp on the street, I gotta rap to
Those who chose to oppose, friend or foes
I still dispose, and blow 'em out like afros
So many rappers have fronted to get a name out
Yelling and screaming and dreaming but still came out
Off the wall and butter soft to y'all
So you waited for Kane to come forth to all
Competition, that bite and chew and crunch and munch
To play me out position, you on a mission
So stop lying and trying to front adventures
Your rhymes are more false than dentures
Freeze, as I get warm like a heater
You bite like a mosquito, but still can't complete a
Rhyme or find the time to design a line
Or phrase that pays, so you dine on mine
Instead of fronting and trying to be a friend of
You might as well say guess who's coming to dinner
So just quit, submit and forget
Huh, you must be on some new improved shit
I get busy from sun to sun
I'm only 21 and untouched by anyone
No one throws, bangs or blows
All foes, I keep 'em running like pantyhose
They get soft and tender, front and then surrender
I turned off more lights than Teddy Pendergrass
Bring on your class, force, team or staff
But when I'm in effect they feel the wrath

Enquiring minds wanna know, did the champ retire?
So here I am, boomin' like an amplifier
I clear my throat, then I float like a boat
Note for note, what I wrote you can't quote or even tote
Raps are too heavy, sharp like a machete
Pass the microphone, 'cause Kane is all ready
Grippin' to play the part to prove that I'm in command
The biggest Daddy of 'em all, and oh, Kane stands for
King Asiatic, nobody's equal
Or non-equivalent, or natural ebony
Or now effective, or never ever
Pick your definition and put it together
'Cause it still comes out tastin' like chocolate
With a finesse MCs never got with
'Cause none of them want me to touch the mic first
They know that it only takes Kane one verse
So here's the microphone, show me what you can do
And, uh, wake me up when you're through
Just so I can go and flow and throw a blow
To show a pro and let 'em all know
That any MC trying to be this lyrical
Should go ask Smokey Robinson for a miracle
I wouldn't let a rapper go one round
I'm knockin' them down just like Jim Brown
So Mister Cee, let the music play

Here's a rap avalanche, MCs travel and
Run-run for shelter, 'cause they don't have a chance
Any MC caught talkin' out of turn
I straighten 'em out just like a perm
Now let's take a second, just to recollect it
Give a little shout to the rappers that's out
Like all the East Coast MCs of today
From Run-DMC on down to Kid 'n Play
The ladies like Salt-N-Pepa to Latifah
Who showed the power of a woman and me a believer
Now backtrack with the musical jewel
And say peace to the old school
And all praises due to the L.A. crew
You put your state on the map and kept bringin' rap through
I can't forget the brothers that's down in Miami
You're still 2 Live if you never get a Grammy
'Cause personally I feel who really needs that stuff
If you ask me, it's just a bunch of makeup
There's a lot of Caucasian kids that don't even know me
'Cause every Billy and Joey is in love with David Bowie
I guess I used the wrong tools in my rhymes
'Cause when I nailed my clock, it didn't say ""Hammer Time""
That's not a diss to my Oaktown friend
That's tellin' you how it is in the musical biz
'Cause I make sure that every rapper in the industry
Becomes a friend of me
And Mister Cee, let the music play

The kiss of death on a rap pick
Then you get a slap quick, so guard it with Chapstick
In other words, protect and hold your own
It only takes one punch to get ya head flown
Fists of fury, suckers get buried
'Cause the Kane got more spice than curry
I am the flavor down on paper
And nothin' could save ya from catchin' the vapors
Rhymes that'll sting your face like a quick jab
And I'm rubbin' 'em in just like Vicks salve
Captivatin', dominatin', innovatin', illustratin', fascinatin'
Motivatin', elevatin', terminatin', mutilatin'
Rhymes they're worth their weight in
Gold, bold, never sold to a bidder
That claim to glitter, you're so bitter like kitty litter
As for damage, don't tell me what another do
'Cause I quote that I'm R-A-W
So make room, 'cause fighters are doomed
Try to consume, and make your own tomb
A grave or a casket, a tisket, a tasket
You're rhymes out of basket
Boy, you get your ass kicked!
For frontin' like you hittin' hard
When your arms are too short to box with God
So don't even touch 'cause I come with too much
Address and bless any mic that I clutch
And for a rapper to challenge my freestyle, he must be senile
And that's why meanwhile, back at the ranch...
The brother Asiatic chosen one is expandin' with a new branch
So many slept on the nonchalant act
Now wake up, sucker, this is mortal combat!

I seize and freeze MC's with these degrees
Put me to my knees, or at ease? Chiiiillld, please
I break it down, to bring on the next act
Rappers are so full of shit, they need Ex-Lax
So stop griffin', your mind is driftin'
Prepare yourself 'cause I get swift and
Captivate the crowd but you can't understand
At times, I gotta say to myself, ""God damn!""
As I get hot, and still be gettin' warmer
And I don't have beef with no other performer
Keep to myself, never bother another
But if a rapper tries to diss, I crush the motherfucker!
Frontin' MC's that be tryin' to riff
Need to save it, and don't even play with
Me when I react like a volcano eruptin'
I step to you and say, ""Now, what's up then?""
Every word'll be just like surgery
Cuttin' you open so rush to emergency
Or even bow to your knees and bend low
Or get played like a game of Nintendo
J-O-K-E-S ain't my style
I ain't a child, that's why I don't smile
I combine a line designed to find behind the mind
So divine, the other rappers need resign
As I go on, from night to morn'
Beginning to end, from Knowledge to Born
Whenever rappers are lookin' for static
Looks like a job for King-Asiatic
N-E, send me competitors
Then again, it might just be better to
Just slow down, you don't wanna throw-down
I get busy, get you dizzy like a merry-go-round
Feel the wrath of a Big Daddy raw rhyme
And competition, prepare for wartime
Be alert for where I drop the bomb at
As I destroy you with mortal combat
Make you say, daddy, I don't want none...
Make you say, daddy, I don't want none...
Make you say, daddy, I don't want none...
Make you say, daddy, I don't want none...

I roll so bold with soul, control the whole patrol
Of folders molders towin' black gold
So let it be said, let it be read 'cause I lead ahead
Of others whose rhymes are old as Pro-Keds
Tryin' to diss the Big Daddy repertoire? Moi?!
You steady screamin' out a antique segment wrote
As I just play 'em like a pregnant roach and STOMP 'EM
For tryin' the forbidden
Your rhymes ain't hittin', boy, you won't be gettin'
None of, or in front of, 'cause every one of
My adversaries lack, you little son of
O-bit-uary columns will read your name
If you ever try to step to the Big Daddy Kane
So any claimin' or aimin' to be champion
Against me? Psssh, can't be won
I rank supreme and it's a rapper's dream
To scheme and fiend for my technique, but redeem
'Cause there's only room for one teacher
Wise words from a wise man'll reach ya
I teach freedom, justice and equality
Peace to the brothers and sisters that follow me
Plenty poisoned minds of the people are ours
Slaves, from mental death in power
That's the reason before I drop this bomb
I say peace to the Nation of Islam

Talk about ever meeting Ms. Right
Well, one thing I know is this girl is hype
Not a crab I see, but such a lovely female
And if looks could kill, she would be in jail
For raving all over with exotic beauty
And to captivate her love is my only duty
There's not a single feature that this girl lacks
Sweetheart, you're my aphrodisiac

You've got me waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So, I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

Now I've talked to young girls and sophisticated ladies
But I swear my dear, none appear on your level baby
Maybe, it's just me imagining
Then again, I probably just haven't been
With the right female and in detail
I'll probably never will be, girl if we fail
'Cause every time I appear to be pleased
You know what happens?
I just get skeezed
You might also like
Baby, I'm waiting for you day by day
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find
So, I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine

The girl that I admire, one that I desire
And no one can stop the feelings that you inspire
The way that you leave me in this obsession
With the chambers of my heart in your possession
We were meant to be together, always and forever
For that engagement, I shall endeavor
Pray for the day that we combine
And I can say for sure that you're truly mine
In benevolence and reverence
As soon as our relationship commence
But for now, I wait impatiently
For the day that you can give your all to me
(You've got me waiting for you day by day)
The moment of truth is what I really should call it
I worked so hard for it, so please don't spoil it
Yeah, it's a lot that I'm asking you to give me
That's only because I need you with me
Side by side, hand in hand
You as my girl and Kane as your man
Bust it
Ever since the first time that I seen her
I wanted her to step inside my arena
I'd be the champion of love, wear the golden glove
And show you what a real man is made of
My feelings I'm sharing because I'm caring
My heart'll tell you why I am so endearing
For a chance at romance, I would love to enhance
I would be your man under any circumstance
Just as long as I can say that you're my own
Your feelings for me and mine alone
We can cherish every moment of the time we spent
Try to take our love to the full extent
The point that I'm trying so hard to get through
Is girl, I'm in love with you
You've got me waiting for you day by day (I'm waiting, everyday)
Fantasies of you has got me drifting away (Dreams, drifting)
And I know, a love like yours would be so hard to find (I know, oh so very hard to find)
So, I'll just keep on waiting for the day you're mine (Mine, mine)

A dramatic, fanatic for our relation
Cupid has me stupid with infatuation
And a fashion of passion, so tenderly
With vibes I can't describe, you send to me
This personal attachment in which I feel
To you my dear, I will try to reveal
All over and over, I'll try and try
Because to see you with the next man makes me cry
I feel that I should be the only man to side you
'Cause no one can love you the way that I do
No one deserves the love you can give
So allow me to show you how I'm out to live
With something very special, palliative and pure
And anything that you want, I can give you more
I'll be calm and gentle, loving and sentimental
Oh, so much emotion, I'm talking devotion
'Cause when I get involved, I get involved so deep
That you would know that my love is something special to keep
But for now, I guess I'll be fine
And keep waiting for the day that you'll be mine5Embed",https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1321503841_BDK%20fade.jpg

Yo, on the M-I-C right about now
I go by the name of Big Daddy Kane
I got my man Scoob Lover on the side of me
DJ Mister Cee on the wheels of steel
Dre on the film and Marley on the boards
We gon' do a little something like this

Some like it hard and some like it soft
Yo, bust the groove as I set it off
But wait a minute
Yo, Scoob, what's up?
Pardon me a moment as I interrupt
For what?
For this
You like the stylish clothes we wear
And you like our flat-top style of hair
It's just those bugged-out things we do
That make the girlies wanna stare
Like when we're chillin' with the crew
Or drinkin' that Olde English brew
Straight from the bottle, not the cup
And it gets us more than just fucked up
And I like it, y'all (And I like it, y'all)
Like it, y'all (Like it, y'all)

Well, I'm the S-C double-O-B L-O-V-E-R, uh

Need a flattop? Come to Scoob, I'm the barber
Of Da Ville
And that's right
Try to step to us, watch what you get
'Cause me and Big Daddy's not havin' it
Well, it's the Big Daddy, so all hail
Save your wack rhymes, hold your female
Pass the Old Gold, trash the ale
Cash your food stamps, get the WIC out the mail
Love to eat shrimps, but I never eat snail
Eat a whole fish except for the tail
Keep food in the fridge so it don't get stale
And when there's nothing to eat, I bite my nails
So Scoob Lover, you know your rhymes are kickin'
Get on the mic 'cause you know you eat chicken
Now, now, now, I'ma place a order for a Scooby snack
Not at the Chinese restaurant because I don't eat cats
Now, who in the world can ever eat these?
When I'm at home, I chow down with ease
And say, ""More beef sausage, mom, please?""
That's right, mama dukes, she feeds me swell
Coffee on the table, orange juice as well
Some of the things I say are outspoken
Guaranteed to have you chokin'
Bitin' MCs are the ones I'm yokin'
Kane, I'm outta here, I guess I'll use my token
I'll walk through the gate if the turnstile's broken
Big Daddy, if you're down with me
Get on the mic on the count of three
One, two, three
Now, I'm a Black brother that's out to succeed
So step aside as I take the lead
Sexy young ladies of a light-skinned breed
You got, you got, you got what I need
Outstanding, kind, cool, and loyal
Drove all the way to Maaco just to change my oil
'Cause I'm the only child, you might think I'm spoiled
Touch the young ladies, make their blood pressure boil
I got the, hmm, hiccups, excuse me, sorry
Score a hundred G's every time I play Atari
Put a hole in the Old Gold, blast the Bacardi
On the dance floor, hype moves I be freakin'
Makin' new steps up every single weekend
Not Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy
I'm only here to party
Yo, check it out, check it out
Turn the music down
Turn the music down
Turn the music down
Here we go, here we go

We gonna end it like this in the place, y'all
It's like this, y'all, and you don't stop
Now, the name Kane is superior to many people
It means King Asiatic Nobody's Equal
I hate to brag, but damn, I'm good
And if mics were my gun, I'd be Clint Eastwood
And if rap was a game, I'd be MVP
Most valuable poet on the M-I-C
And if rap was a school, I'd be the principal
Aw, fuck it, the Kane is invincible
To be specific, I may die one day
But my rhymes will remain like a hieroglyphic
It's a certain special skill that takes much practice
I got it good, apparently you lack this
So in turn, sit back and learn

The one they call the Big Daddy Kane is here
To deliver a message to everyone everywhere
So listen up, party people, 'cause this you should hear
It's a story of a far-away atmosphere
That you will find very rare and far beyond compare
All is sincere and rather debonair
So let's all gather around, because

Off to a place you thought was unreal
Where people of the world do know how to chill
Everything remains cool and calm where you are
And if you ask about crime, they all'll say, ""Huh?""
They wouldn't even know what you mean
'Cause it's a different program, y'all know the routine
Where people work hard for a decent buck
And you can wear truck jewelry without being stuck
Never wondering whether your house is all right
So go leave your VCR on the porch overnight
And as for the people, they all stand proud
Senior citizens party with the hip-hop crowd
You can hang at a jam 'til the break of dawn
And leave without your Bally shoes getting stepped on
Everyone walks around in their right mind in awe
Because crack ain't nothing but a hole in the wall
So those who wish to live with glare and flair
There's a place that this can be done, and yo

As something that you find in your wildest dream
But on the real tip, you will see
I'm not playing, what I'm saying is reality
There is a place people live with joy
That the next man cannot come along and destroy
No one faces problems, no one says sorry
And war ain't nothing but a game on Atari
This message also applies to other nations
Like Africa, for instance, where there's starvation
But if you come with me, you're sure to see
Ethiopians can eat in Red Lobster for free
And people that you saw before that were poor
Will never ever see the situation no more
'Cause in this world everyone's a millionaire
Is there a WIC? Are you sick? And what the hell is welfare?
Fashions are smashing for all to flaunt
And we can get anything that we want
So don't think you can't afford expensive design
Because fresh Gucci wear is only $5.99
So come, ye all, and attend this affair
As we journey to the promised land, and

Mm, yeah, I'll take you there, oh
Mm, yeah, I'll take you there, oh
Mm, yeah, I'll take you there, oh
Since I'm the type of guy that laughs and jokes
This may sound funny, but seriously, folks
It's a shame that people today must live
In a world that's operating oh so negative
But I found a place designed especially for you
Where peace and harmony is everyone's culture
So let's all gather around before this world corrupts
And we don't even need Scotty to beam us up, because

Grab a hold of yourself, open your eyes
Get wise to the exercise
Being taught by the teacher that's most dominant
You need knowledge? Well, I'm dropping it
Listen to the rap, allow it to trap
Your body and soul so that you can adapt
To the man on display as I take you away
So may I? Yes, you may
Proud to be a Black man coming exact and
Giving up to brothers, five on the backhand
Pray for lease and peace upon each other
With my sisters and brothers (Yo, word to the mother)
I say the mother as in the motherland
But on the other hand, another man
Tackled and shackled our ancestors
But we beat him with freedom, so let's bless the
Country that we all came from
Because the moral of it all is we shall overcome
The cream will keep rising, we be sizing
Up, the Asiatic one is enterprising
Building and building to carry on
All the way from Malcolm X to Farrakhan
Martin Luther was a tutor, many were pupils
Those who fell victim were those without scruples
However, to sever, we could never
So hold up the peace sign and stand together
Take heed to the words that I manifest
And when I'm through speaking, Marley Marl'll do the rest

People, people
We gotta get over
Before we go under
People, people
We gotta get over
Before we go under
Let's get together
Let's get together
Yo, Big Daddy, what you gon' say now?

Take a stand, the fight for power
'Cause we've been here before the Mayflower
Living superior, abiding by nature
The history of the Asiatic one paid the
Price to be paid in slavery
Like the name of Antonio was gave to me
But knowledge of self broke every shackle and chain
Now I declare myself as the Big Daddy Kane
The teacher teaching a lesson to be heard
That's word to the mother, my brother
So discover the truth of one another
'Cause here's the real deal upon our skin color
Lay down white, yellow, red, or pink
But the color of black is most dominant
The rising and sizing can never cease
(What you gon' say now?) Peace
The mother of all living things and the Black man
Is the original man, we just can't escape our destiny
(Word to the mother)
The mother of all living things and the Black man
Is the original man, we just can't escape our destiny

Uh Yeah

Trying to make them understand the realness in this here game man you know
This how serious it is on these streets
Yo check it, uh...

Survival of the Fittest today, that's still the test
I seen em kill the best, in this ghetto wilderness
It's real in the field, cause they bring the drama hard
Guliani got New York looking like it's Amistad
Be whatever's clever, with the thought of slipping
Thugs start to flipping, black women resort to stripping
When they say, the drug game's dead, that's not a fable
Hustlers is locked down or either got a label
Either try to keep the heat on ya on the street corner
Ya sleep, a week later your peeps mourn ya
Stick up kids putting in working in Ps
Your food stamps feed the next cat Turkey and Cheese
Ain't no devourance, I speak it now in defense
I'm only here to make dollar, outta knowledge, power, sense
So be about the paper till your pockets are full
Please stop with the bull, less is profitable, come on...

Thinking ahead of you, that's your girl, let her through

In this ghetto, your friends flip on you like Doberman's
Dat buldge in your pocket I see, you better hide
While you at it, tuck that medallion inside
Forget the microphone, you need the iron we squeeze
So you can clap four like Siamese seals
Distrust and greed, this was indeed
Given by the man's and know we living by the land
And life I tackle with my soul trapped inside this Tabernacle
The only thing that's missing is the shackles
Do what we gotta to enterprise with the dollar
Create a different aura for the children of tommorow

Write is wrong when hype is written
On the Soul, De La that is
Style is surely our own thing
Not the false disguise of show-biz
De La Soul is from the soul
And in fact I can't deny
Strictly from the Dan called Stuckie

But that glory's been denied

By stating I'm darkly pack
I know this, so, I point at Q-Tip
And he states, ""Black is Black""

Shovel chestnuts in my path
Just keep all nuts twistin' up
So, I don't get an aftermath
But if I do, I'll calmly punch them

Gun control means usin' both hands in my land (Yeah)
Where it's all about the cautious livin' (Uh-huh)
Migratin' to a higher form of consequence
Compliments of strugglin' that shouldn't be notable
Man, every word I say should be a Hip-Hop Quotable

I'm sick of bitches shakin' asses
I'm sick of talkin' 'bout blunts, sick of Versace glasses
Sick of slang, sick of half-ass awards shows
Sick of name-brand clothes (Word)
Sick of R&B bitches over bullshit tracks (Heard)

(Got to have soul)
Three, that's the magic number
(Three) Yes, it is, it's the magic number (Three)
Somewhere in this hip-hop soul community
Was born three: Mase, Dove, and me
And that's the magic number
(What does it all mean?)

Difficult preachin' is Posdnuos' pleasure
Pleasure in preachin' starts in the heart
Something that stimulates the music in a measure
Measure in the music, breaks in three parts
Casually see but don't do like the soul
'Cause seein' and doin' are actions for monkeys
Doin' hip-hop hustle, no rock and roll
Unless your name's Brewster, 'cause Brewster's a Punky (Three)
Parents let go, 'cause there's magic in the air
Criticizing rap shows you're out of order
Stop, look and listen to the phrasin' Fred Astaires
And don't get offended while Mase do-si-do's your daughter
A tri-cameral system is now set
Fly rhymes are stored under Da.I.S.Y Productions
It stands for ""Da Inner Sound, Y'all"" and y'all can bet
That the action's not a trick, but sure 'nough a function

Everybody wants to be a DJ
Everybody wants to be an emcee
But being speakers are the best
And you don't have to guess
De La Soul posse consist of three
And that's the magic number
(Three)

This here piece of the pie
Is not dessert, but the course that we dine
And three out of every darn time
The effect is ""Mmm"" when a daisy grows in your mind
Showing true position, this here piece is
Kissin' the part of the pie that's missin'
When that negative number fills up the casualty
Maybe you can subtract it
You can call it your lucky partner
Maybe you can call it your adjective
But odd as it may be
Without my one and two where would there be
My three? Mase, Posand me
And that's the magic number
(What does it all mean?)
Focus is formed by flaunts to the soul
Souls who flaunt styles gain praises by pounds
Common are speakers who honor the scroll
Scrolls written daily creates a new sound
Listeners listen 'cause this here is wisdom
Wisdom of a Speaker, a Dove and a Plug
Set aside a legal substance to feed 'em
For now get 'em high off this dialect drug (Three)
Time is a factor so it's time to count
Count not the negative actions of one
Speakers of soul say it's time to shout
Three forms the soul to a positive sum
Dance to this fix and flex every muscle
Space can be filled if you ride like my lumber
Advance to the tune but don't do the hustle
Shake, rattle, roll to my magic number
(Three)

Now you may try to subtract it
But it just won't go away
Three times one?

And that's a magic number

Alphabetically stuck on that A grade shit
Now quit now before we pour
That sure shot pure rock cocaine flow

Been on in the game as long as he can wheelie a Schwinn
Turn the corner spinning, bust that ass and get up
Dust off the mask, whoever laugh give him a head up
He got jumped, it pumped his adrenaline
He said it made him tougher than a bump of raw medicine
To write all night long, the hourglass is still slow
Flow from Hellborn to free power like LILCo
And still owe bills, pay dues forever
Slay youths when it comes to who's more cleverer
Use to wore a leather goose V with a fur collar
And charged a fee for loose leaf words per dollar
Ya heard? Holler, broad or dude, we need food

String 'em up, ring 'em up under whack junk snack

You slow, you blow the soup on you fools, his own Boss like Hugo

You go lights, camera, action with no makeup

Here's a couple of nice guys who finished first
So nice try, but the prize is ours dispersed
They say the good die young, so I added some
Badass to my flavor to prolong my life over the drum
Everyone cools off from being hot
It's about if you can handle being cold or not
And we was told to hop on no one's dick by Prince Paul
We stayed original ever since y'all
First to do a lot of things in the game but the last to say it
No need to place it on a scale to weigh it
And don't do it for the praise or to raise the bar
Yet it's raised anyway, it's so amazing, are
The three L.I. brothers from the other way of thinking
Hey your lady's winking, I think you need to control that
Or I'll have to hold that

Greetings girl and welcome to my world of phrase
I'm right up to bat
It's a D.A.I.S.Y. Age and you're about to walk top-stage
So wipe your Lottos on the mat
Hip-hop love this is and don't mind when I quiz your
Involvements before the sun
But clear your court 'cause this is a one-man sport
And who's better for this than Plug One? (Plug One)
Now don't worry about me squashin' other deals
'Cause they've already been squooshed
Freeze a frame about moods the same which we can continue
Right behind the bush
You'll stay with me, I know this
But not because of all my Earthly treasures
Or regardless to the fact that I'm Posdnuos
But because

I know I'll love you better

May I cut this dance to introduce myself as
The chosen one to speak?
Let me lay my hand across yours
And aim a kiss upon your cheek
The name's Plug Two (Is Plug Two)
And from the soul I bring you
The Daisy of your choice
May it be filled with the pleasure principle
In circumference to my voice
About those other Jennys I reckoned with
Lost them all like a homework excuse
This time the Magic Number is two
'Cause it takes two, not three, to seduce
My destiny of love is brought to an apex
Sex is a mere molecule
In this world of love that I have for you
It's true (True)

Of Daisies for a bouquet of Soul (Soul)
Life will begin at the cut of a rim
Take it as filled to the rim as in brim
Squeeze your stoop like Betty Boop
We'll make Campbell's Alphabet Soup
And spell Plug One's within
Forward march is the say
When transistors will play
Come into bed is the mood
Dolby sound will be then top crowned
When I put the needle into your groove
I got a good thing
And in full swing (In full swing)
I show this in gifts, words or letters
But even without those three
I know you'll be close to me 'cause

I know I'll love you better
It's I again, and the soul that I send
Is taking steps to reach your heart
Any moment you feel alone
I can fill up your empty part
We can ascend 'til we reach De La Heaven
And in a spin we'll hit the Top Ten
Then we can meet Mr. Stuckie
And Pos' brother Lucky will preach
""Let the wedding begin"" (The wedding begin)
Shot by an arrow of cupid
Through the string of a G-clef
My dear, I claim you're deaf
And if you can hear me, by golly gee
Trugoy is ready for what you possess
We could live in my Plug Two home
And on Mars where we could be all alone
And we make a song for two
Picture perfect things and I sing of how

Hello it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who's holdin' my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)

Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out the jungle
(The Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

De La Soul, from the soul
Black medallions, no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos, hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face
You might also like
For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I'll initiate the buddy with a slap

Now for the next
I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And when I quest for the buddy I don't fess
For my jimmy wants nothin' but the best (the best)
The best (ooh wee!)
Let's stick out jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick em up, stick em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)
(Sweet little woman, sweet little woman)

I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y (why)
'Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny I seem
(Very serious) like a Peek Frean
Buddy is the act that occurs on the lift
When Jenny and jimmy start shootin' the gift
Boy let me get shot I won't even riff
Buddy buddy, don't you know you make me go nutty
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy
Not too skinny and not too chubby
Soft like Silly Putty
Miss Crabtree, I hope that you're not mad at me
'Cause I told you that it was your buddy
That was making me ever so horny
Junglelistically horny

On the dial my buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the (Q-Tip: Q to her Tip)
On the A side or sometimes the flip
(Never gonna flip this record)
Buddy is the bud to my daisy tree
And the Luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug 3
(Plug 3 gets all the buddy)

Behind my bush, my buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Or let loose the juice)
My buddy helps me to
(De La my Soul)
Keepin' jimmy in total control
Without Jimmy I'd be on a roll
(La la la l-la la la la, la la la l-la la la la)

Hey girl I heard ya lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, here's what we'll find
A whole lot of fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (yeah that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my buddy, I will boast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille MacGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your buddy

The best buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee) word to the D
I don't beg I just tease my buddy with my right leg
And when it's ready what's said is buddy is best in bed
(Word)

Fly buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't worry cause I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you (she freaked us)

And I watched and then I checked my Swatch
To see the time
The Soul had formed a buddy line
And that buddy was (mine all mine)

Now when Tribe, the Jungle, and De La Soul
Is at the clubs our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' in every brand)
'Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas, should we keep her aware?
(Mmm Hmm, yeah!)

Yes, this is Miss Renee King
I'm in Philadelphia
I want you to give me a call on area code 215-222-4209 and I'm calling in reference to the music business
Thank you

Hey, how you doin'? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you?
Hey, how are you doin'? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you?

Once again, it's another rap bandit
Fiending at I and I can't stand it
Wanna be down with the Day-Glo
Knockin' on my door, sayin', ""Ayo, yo""
Knockin' on my door, sayin', ""Ayo, yo""
""I got a funky new tune with a fly banjo""
I can't understand what the problem is
I find it hard enough dealing with my own biz
How'd they get my name and number?
Then I stop and think and wonder
'Bout a plan, yo, man, I gotta step out town
You wanna call me up? Take my number down
It's 222-2222
I got an answering machine that can talk to you
It goes
You might also like
Hey, how you doin'? Sorry you can't get through
But leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you

Yo, check it, exit the old style, enters the new
But nothing's new 'bout being hawked by a few
Or should I say a flock 'cause around every block
There's Harry, Dick, and Tom, with a demo in his palm
Now I'm with helping those who want to help themselves and flaunt a nut that's doggy as a doe
But it's not the mood to hear the tales of limousines and pails of money they'll make like a pro
I be like, ""Yo, black, just play me the tape""
But at the show, the time to spare I just make
But the songs created in they shacks be so wick-wick-whack, situations like this, I now hate
They give me smiles Kool-Aid wide and ask, ""Was it def?""
And with the straightest face I be like, ""Hell yes""
I slip them the digits to papa Prince Paul
So I don't go AWOL, but yet I know when they call, they get

Hey, how you doin'? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you?
Hey, how are you doin'? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you?
Check it out
Party at the dug-out on Dixon Ave, haven't been to a jam in quite a while
Figure I'll catch up on the latest styles 'stead piles and piles of demo tapes by the miles
All I wanna do is cut on the deck crowd, but edition up here by the mile to the center
Reliever of duty, Plug One moseys in and I be like, ""Yo G, Pos does all the producing""

Now woe is me to the third degree
Mase pulls the funny, so I make like a bunny, jettin'
But I'm getting used to this demo abuse
Getting raped and giving birth to a tape
'Cause there's no escape from the clutches of a hawker
Attached to my success, sent like a stalker
Make way to my radius playin' fly guy
Try to get my back, they force like Luke Sky'
Me, myself, and I go through this act daily and rarely do I not
No matter how I dodge, some jackal always nails me, no matter what the plot
And even out on tour they be like, ""Yo, I got a tape to play you back at the hotel""
I be like, ""Oh, swell""
Unveil the numeric code that dials my room
And tell them to call me at noon
But of course there's no answering machine in my room
But a pretty young adorer who I swung on tour
And if it rings while we're alone, she'll answer the phone
And with the quickness, she'll recite like a poem
""Hey, you done did the right thing, dialed up my ring ring
Now you're waiting on the beep
Say, I would love if you'd sing a tune to Tru instead of frontin' on the speak
So no problemo, just play your demo, and at the end, it's break out time
Please, oh, please, don't press rewind 'cause I'll just lay it down the line""

Hey, how you doing? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and I'll get back to you?
Hey, how you doing? Sorry you can't get through
Why don't you leave your name and your number and we'll get back to you?
Peace

Yo, what's up, man? This is Ronald Master down with the Fish Tank Posse, man, you know, man
So you know, you can just hook me up, Tru
You know I got this fly new jam called ""Swimming In the Fish Tank""
You know we gon' rock it, man, you know what I'm saying
But I just need your help, Prince Paul gave me your number, you know, man, you just gotta do that for me
Got this fly bass line, got these fly trombones in it, man, so just hook me up, man, just look out, alright, man?

Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better
Pain will make it better

Let me see how many palms go up high
If you've ever felt the world had you licked (Put 'em up high)
And what you waving side to side to symbolize
Needing help on the sand put you under quick
Big mama said, ""The Devil's up to no good""
But we can heal it on a Sunday with a good book (What?)
Or we can kill it on a Monday for a good look (And)
Make it part of the campaign, to withstand pain
Me, myself, place it all on my shoulders
And give it my all, like heavy lifting
No gain without tears and sweat
They claim blue skies with white clouds, steady drifting
When pain come to get ya, it hit ya like flu
Better times will pick ya, do what you gotta do
To earn focus in the stormy weather
Come out the tunnel to the light, saying

Slow pain, no gain, go-getter
Change like the weather
Solid as a rock, small piece of leather but well put together
Flames are endeavors
Time to find out that gain makes it better
Pain makes it better
Shades of epiphany, can't let it get to me
Move so differently, do it so swiftly
Ease into my style, lay mine down
King be crowned, look at me now
Teaching my classes by the masses
Used to gang-bang, used to love the clashes
Now cash is the only motivation
But not for me, G, I’m into public relations
That's food for your De La Soul, word to the letter
Pain will make it better
Tell me how you feel
Look over your shoulder
Time will make it real
Give me no excuses
I know how ya feel
Pain will make it better

The bigger the headache, bigger the pill
The harder you fall, stronger the will
We came from the back of the bus, talking Watts to Mobile
Now we're on a house on a hill
Struggle went from filling ya gas tank
The bank wasn't feeling your loan
The OT couldn't cover the bills
When life came with a couple of spills
But we're gon' use that pain for fuel, so

Give me no excuses

Yo, I got a phonecall from a girl
She wants some, OK, and I say hold up, ha ha
Yo, dig this, we tryna get money here
WRMS, De La Soul, Saturday, y'all

(And rollerskates)
(And rollerskates)
(And rollerskates)

Girl meets boy on Thursday night
Boy was high, girl fly like kite
They hold hands until next day
Boy then lets go, hit his way
Boy rules butt, brags to his boys
Erection brings bad boy joys
Boy thinks of that big fat back
Big black fat love, big black fat
Girl calls boy to stand him up on Saturday
Saturday

Back once more with the wallop in the store
Sponsored by the riff, should I make you rock your hip
Reviver of a roller-boogie in a rink
And sure to make you think about the times
To scope fun instead of fights
(But diving from a piece of metal sure to take your life)
Yo, slip your butt to the fix of this mix
Toss that briefcase, it's time to let loose
'Cause you've worked like heck to get the weekend check
So unfasten that noose around your neck
Connected like a vibe from the wheel to the foot
Come on everybody, dig the funky output

Five days you work
One whole day to play
Come on everybody, wear your rollerskates today
It's Saturday, Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday
Saturday, it's Saturday-ay
(Is the word, is the word, is the word, is the word)

Now as you pump your fist I reminisce
To a bounce, rock, skate, roll fest to impress
Hey, pretty diamond, do you like the way I'm dressed?
Cool, keep the faith and be my mate
Cause all we need is feet
(And rollerskates)
But promote the hustle, 'cause it keeps me thin
No need to talk, look who just walked in
(Is there a Dred on skates?)
Yes, man
(So kick the wham on this jam)
Oh Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler
Wet me for one, Mr. Sprinkler
I'm heatin' high-five in a daze, no split
With a yawn, I trip to the dawn
Out comes the bodies following the one idea
It's clear, rattle to the roll
Hold back up the track, grab your rollerskates, y'all
And let's zip on by
Zip-a-de-doo-dah, let's zip on by
Feed on a weed and we're feeling high
Sun is on thick and the cheese is rollin' quick
Come on, there's no time to hide
Season is twist, spinning and winning
No hackeysack, let let me in
Spill on the bottom away, but it's okay, hut
It's a Saturday

Pos: Now let's all get baked like Anita

I was born in the Boogie Down cat scan
Where my building fell down on the rats and
People sold the super on a trip to the penile (penile)
While I settle off the shores of the Long Isle
My file is clean, I mean my mind is clear when I transmit
I am the man-ner of the family 'cause the pants fit
I want to let forensics prove that I can mends Groove
With the thread from needle outta hay, wanna say
Salutations to the nation of the Nubians
We 'bout to place you in that 3 Feet of stew again
I got the frequency to shatter Mrs. Jones' perm
I gotta ""hey love"" all the honies, cost me short term
Tallying a score for the shottie in the jacket
For the brother bes a nigga when he packs it

Ayo, groove with the mayor, hazard on the sayer
Wave the eighteen mill', even still
Sack a bag of troubles, make a single double
Loop the coin and join the minimum wage
I had a plan if I was the man, I'd pro the jects
Lay it low and leg mad cassettes
I unconditioned my ways of the everyday sunset
Wagin' my days to the one bet
'Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin'
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
'Cause the days of the breaks be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm exploding
I be the fab, I be the fabulous but see, unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name (ah one two, ah one two)
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin' on to when I caught the fame (ah one two, ah one two)
Pass the task to ask me 'bout the Native Tongue again, my friend

'Cause in the midst, man, it's alright
Momma got the book into my day-life
My pops got the belt, so best believe we sail the wave
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, I stay inside of my gates
Break days mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eye-scan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew old with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special
Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew, we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the never-ending factor while I'm on, so tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
('Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo, he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin' up the stream

We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell

Lovestruck was my mode
Took a look, dropped my textbook
Jenifa... (oh!)
Breakfast, broke it fast
She was in my English class
Asked for notes, rocked my boat
Jenifa... (oh!)
Jenny, lost her favorite penny
So I gave her a dollar
She kissed me (and I hollered)
In a flash the school bell rang
Jenny grabbed on to my hand
Took me home and said, Trugoy just
Swing and swing and swing

The downstairs, where we met
I brought records, she cassettes
Lost the breaks, found her shape
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Transcripts showed more than flirt
""I love Daisies"" read her shirt
Grabbed my jeans, Jimmy screamed
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Marvelous, shaped like a vase
No one can live their life for Pos
Found a house, aroused my joust
Jenifa, oh Jeny
Her clothes, I did shuck
Just like Dan, I strictly stuck
To the punt, she cried, ""Kick it""
Posdnuos was in
Jenny
Only thought about Jimmy
But asked was I a virgin
Like some kid named Derwin?
She said, ""Let’s try it in the bathroom""
But ’dnuos is way above sinks
So to the kitchen she did Dan

Always exhale the facts 'cause I don't inhale la/lie

Much too complex, EFX/effects be live like Das
Makin' moves down South, to avoid the chaos
And never, flaunt the coin 'cause dime-getters be gazin'
They call me Luther Van', they say my style is So Amazing (Ha)
I'm fazin' those who're supposed to have the last laughter
'Cause even when I'm gone, I'm reappearin' in the after—

Rather be in Bebe's alley, than at the Clique with gators

And when one shows he pose threat to this one
This one will make that one into none

""And now for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics
Perhaps the most famous classic in all the world of music—""
The first time around, you didn't quite understand our new style of
Speak
(Don't worry, we can fix that right now)
So why don't you all just grab your bags
(Come on aboard, hoist the anchor, and we'll be off)
(And good luck to both of you)
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One, Plug Two
Plug One, Plug Two, Plug One

Answering any other service
Prerogative praised positively I'm acquitted
Enemies publicly shame my ability
After the battle they admit that I'm with it
Simply soothe, will move vinyl like glue
Transistors are never more shown with
Like wind, vocal flow brings it all down in ruin
Due to a clue of a naughty noise called plug tunin'

(""Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm"")

Flock to the preacher called Pos
Let him be the stir to the style of your stew
Sit while the kid of the Plug form aroma
Then grab a Daisy to sip your favorite brew
Lettin' this soul fire be your first prior
But don't let the kick drum stub your big toe
See that the three will be your thread
But like my man Chuck D said, 'What a brother know'
Dance while I play and the cue cards sway
From my flower girls China and Jette
The button is pressed, in '89 we'll start the panic
From De La Soul and a Prince from Stet
Negative noise will be all divided
Dangerous to dance, Posdnuos will croon
Ducks and kizids will all be rid
When paying position to the naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'

Freeze cause these are the brothers
Brothers of the Soul who present a new flick
Every last viewer is tuned to the method
Known to be a method, no magicians, not a trick
Bitten by the spoken who been titled Plug Two
Swallowed by the loonies who are jealous with the showbiz
Dove'll teach the truth, Posdnuos will preach the youth
To the fact that this will bring an end to the negative
Flow to the sway cause I say fa-so-la-ti
At the top we will dwell
Difference is fame and we rise then we build
Where we are set, we get fat and we swell
Motions of the Soul is a positive stride
One step forward is the space we consume
Vivid as the moon, you have yet to assume
How the Soul found the motto of a naughty noise called
Plug Tunin'
(""Hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmm-mm, hmmmm"")

Vocal is local so believe that
This chant sends L.I. on the strong map
Trying and live so you best realize
That the gift that I present, I say gift wrap
Style of the Tune is personal
And defining what's the rhyme is worst of all
Stop, sit and study cause the meaning isn't muddy
Just preach and do the gear as the first of all
Watch while the pitcher is pitching
'Cause this is the pitch of the year
Sing a simple song but keep the swing strong
Though you heard Dove crying, I ain't fearing
Those who think De La's on the flip tip
Try to flip this and you're doomed
Watch for the B-B cause if you try to grieve me
You'll be hung by the wire of the Plug Tune

All in a day

Do you remember the taste?
Remember family names
Your child, my child, our child

Different to my world now
Remember the ways

A ballad was born upon a demo of a fly love song
Didn't take long before the archer with the wings heard it
Shot us in the heart with a contract, he knew we were a hit
The right amount of soul with a parallel amount of grit
But the archer couldn't see the target of departure
Gave in your pink slip and called it quits
It's understood you would
Label me the mate who wronged you
Cause I kept wanting to feature
With them other females on they songs too
Your words spoken in mono for monogamy
Telling me I had to go cause I chose
Stereo for stereo typical male biology
And now I'm left setting traps
For you to fall in for me again
Who hates you to tell me
""Slow up the pace, maybe erase, don't…""

Slow up the pace
Maybe erase, don't remember my waist

Cause it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's easy to recall the good and fall into place
But you're not easy to love
I love the memory of...
Our last trip to Vegas had me feeling like we had a chance
But chance just showed up at the wedding
I guess I didn't read the heading
""Forgivin' won't erase the bitter past""
But I ain't up for kissing ass
I bought you everything your pretty feet could fit in
Put you behind the finest steering wheels
Fearing you would drive a nigga crazy
Told you grow up, but shit, you was my baby
Bits and pieces never made nothing decent
When I accommodated you, you played me like a stranger

I remember you now (Accountability is major)
A part of what I did then
Remember your face
Just don't let me trip over memory lane
Cause time can't be replaced
And I don't want to stay

Cause, oh, it's so easy to fall back to the memory of
And it's so dah-dah-dee-dah

As we go a little somethin' like this
Look, ma, no protection, now I got a daughter named Ayana Monay
And I can play the cowboy to rustle in the dough, so the scenery is healthy where her eyes lay
I am an early bird but the feathers are black, so the apples that I catch are usually all worms
But it's a must to decipher one's queen from a worm who plays groupie and spread around the bad germ
I cherish the twilight
I maximize, my soul is the right size
I watch for the power to run out on the moon
And that'll be sometime soon
Faker than a fist of kids speakin' that they're Black when they just niggas trying to be Greek
Or some tongues who lied and said, ""We'll be natives to the end,"" nowadays we don't even speak
I guess we got our own life to live, or is it because we want our own kingdom to rule?
Every now and then I step to the now, for now I see back then I might have acted like a fool
Now, I won't apologize for it, this is not a bunch of Bradys, but a bunch of black man's pride
Yet I can safely say, I've never played a sister by touching where her private parts reside
I've always walked the right side of the road, if I wasn't making song, I wouldn't be a thug selling drugs
But a man with a plan, and if I was a rug cleaner, bet you Pos'd have the cleanest rugs
I am

The Plug Two brand with the flavor in the flute, watch the sniffin', so a sack of shows in demand
I read the diction from the second page, I got the one-two gauge, baritone to the izm fan
Trees fall so I can play ground with my ink, so let me need you to my ems go
I push the infinite and carry it, my carrier's the three over one, so my pluggins already know
Lick shots with moo, catch the boo from a ghost in the heckling crowd if I give a foot
Jack Ville caught a spill when a spill came from my mouth
I brought a head down south
I don't check for the noose and the neck, so I never tell my ems that finesse is knocking at my door
I choose to run from the rays of the burning sun and dodge a needle washing up upon a sandy shore
I bring the element H with the 2, so you owe me what's coming when I'm raining on your new parade
It's just mind over matter and what matters is that the mind isn't guided by the punished shade
I keep the walking on the right side, but I won't judge the next who handles walking on the wrong
'Cause that's how he wants to be, no difference, see, I wanna be like the name of this song
I am

I be the new generation of slaves
Here to make papes to buy a record exec rakes

But I guess I don't get a cut cuz my rent's a month late

The deeds of a natural are seeds that are no longer planted, so the famine in the mind is strong
Tactics of another plane is now proven sane, sane enough to let you know from within this song

I was Moses hopelessly scorned by your thorn Zipporah
Tried to bring that fairy-tale life, you wanted horror
But my microscope couldn't see or cope with that
I had to bolt from that, and left you dead in the sea
It's better for me, I'm satisfied with repping for D

We were certified hot, then dropped to lukewarm
Now we back up in the spot, claiming never been gone
Niggas who cut us off, wanna reattach us now
(Them girls who brushed us off, say they want some #'s to dial)
Yeah I give that ass a number, and some lumber to pile
Now catch a curve from my kick (or show me loving by brick)
So stick to the same plan, don't come shaking my hand
Like we peeps, it ain't beef but be sure to understand
Between us, it ain't all
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you

You see them kids be scheming on what we done copped
Always out there scheming!
They steady fiending for the moment they can get us off the block
Why they always fiending?
Your people might have your back, but you need to watch your front
Indeed, ain't nothing guaranteed
That's the truth! Things ain't goin' like you think they should
A lot say they wanna walk in my size 10's
Alright then; here's a pair
Lace 'em up tight then you might feel what was dealt to me
You see ain't no young boys up in here; keep a clear head
Trying to keep my pockets on stuffed, like deer heads
Upon the wall, so all the gall we get from y'all don't phase
So mind your biz and walk away
'Cause I'm never gonna let you up inside my maze

I don't care about what you think you see
The things you want to know when you look at me
God knows I done been through and paid my dues
Can't change how you feel, 'cause it's all on you, woah, oh, yeah
It ain't all good, and that's the truth
Thangs ain't goin' like you think they should, it's all on you
It ain't all good, and that's the truth

""If you will suck my soul
I will lick your funky emotions""

This is the stylin' for a title that sounds silly
But nothin' silly about the triflin' times of Millie
Millie a Brooklyn Queen originally from Philly
Complete with that accent that made her sound hillbilly
Around this time the slammin' joint was “Milk is Chillin'”
But even cooler was my social worker Dillon
Yeah I had a social worker 'cuz I had some troubles
Anyone who'd riff on me, I'd pop their dome like bubbles
He'd bring me to his crib to watch my favorite races
That's how his daughter Millie became one of my favorite faces
She had the curves that made you wanna take chances
I mean on her, man, I'd love to make advances
I guess her father must 'a got the same feelin'
I mean, actually findin' his own daughter Millie appealing
At the time no one knew but it was a shame
That Millie became a victim of the touchy-touchy game

Yo Millie, what's the problem, lately you've been buggin'
On your dookie earrings, someone must be tuggin'
You were a dancer who could always be found clubbin'
Now you're world renowned with the frown you're luggin'
Come to think your face look stink when Dill's around you
He's your father-what done happen-did he ground you?
You shouldn't flip on him 'cuz Dill is really cool
Matter of fact, the coolest elder in the school
He hooked up a trip to bring us all the Lacey
He volunteered to play old Santa Claus at Macy's
Child, ya got the best pops anyone could have
Dillon's cool, super hip, you should be glad
You might also like
Yeah, it seemed that Santa's ways were parallel with Dillon
But when Millie and him got home, he was more of a villain
While she slept in he crept inside her bedroom
And he would toss her and then would force her to give him head room
Millie tried real hard to let this hell not happen
But when she'd fuss, he would just commence the slappin'
(Yo Dillon man, Millie's been out of school for a week, man, what's the deal?)
I guess he was givin' Millie's bruises time to heal
Of course he told us she was sick and we believed him
And at the department store as Santa we would see 'em
And as he smiled, his own child was at home plottin'
How off the face of this earth she was gonna knock him
When I got home, I found she had tried to call me
My machine had kicked to her hey how ya doin' (sorry)
I tried to call the honey but her line was busy
I guess I'll head to Macy's and bug out on Dillon

I received a call from Misses Sick herself
I asked her how was she recoverin' her health
She said that what she had to ask would make it seem minute
She wanted to talk serious, I said, ""go ahead-shoot""
She claimed I hit the combo dead upon the missile
Wanted to know if I could get a loaded pistol
That ain't a problem but why would Millie need one
She said she wanted her pops Dillon to heed one
Ran some style about him pushin' on her privates
Look honey, I don't care if you kick five fits
There's no way that you can prove to me that Dill's flip
He might breathe a blunt but ya jeans he wouldn't rip
You're just mad he's your overseer at school
No need to play him out like he's someone cruel
She kicked that she would go get it from somewhere else
Yeah, whatever you say, go for ya self
Macy's department store, the scene for Santa's kisses
And all the little brats demandin' all of their wishes
Time passes by as I wait for my younger brother
He asks his wish, I waste no time to return him back to Mother
As I'm jettin', Millie floats in like a zombie
I ask her what's her problem, all she says is ""Where is he?""
I give a point, she pulls a pistol, people screamin'
She shouts to Dill, “He's off to hell cuz he's a demon!”
None of the kids could understand what was the cause
All they could see was a girl holdin' a pistol on Claus
Dillon pleaded mercy, said he didn't mean to
Do all the things that her mind could do nothing but cling to
Millie bucked him and with the quickness it was over4Embed",https://images.genius.com/74eced2a1a6baae90f5d2e678b1d494a.600x600x1.jpg

""Yeah, Gangsta Dresta done stepped in this, motherfucker. And this one goes out to all the O.G.'s out there. And I can't forget the baby gangstas, what's up, niggas? My nigga they came back with some of that old school original west coast shit, nigga. That got all of y'all on his dick in the first place, yeah. So run that shit, E, yeah.""

Cruisin' down the street in my '64
Jockin' the freaks, clockin' the dough
Went to the park to get the scoop
Knuckleheads out there cold shooting some hoops
A car pulls up, who can it be?
A fresh El Camino rolling Kilo G
He rolls down his window and he started to say
It's all about making that GTA

Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash, we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

Donald B's in the place to give me the pace
He said, ""My man JD is on freebase""
The boy JD was a friend of mine
'Til I caught him in my car trying to steal a Alpine
Chased him up the street to call a truce
The silly cluck-head pulls out a deuce-deuce
Little did he know, I had a loaded 12 gauge

Niggas out there making that dollar
I pulled up in my '64 Impala
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinking
And from the 8-ball my breath start stinking
Left to get my girl to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Went to her house to get her out of the pad
Dumb ho said something that made me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave
She started talking shit, wouldn't you know?
Reached back like a pimp, slapped the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I bombed on pops, knocked his ol' ass out

Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit
Now I'm rolling hard, now under control
Then wrapped the '64 'round a telephone pole
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh, brother
Throw it in the gutter and go buy another""
Walking home and I see the G ride
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side
As they busted a U, they got pulled over
A undercover cop in a dark green Nova
Now Kat got beat for resisting arrest
He socked the pig in the head for rippin' his Guess
Now G is caught for doing the crime
Fourth offense on the boy, he'll do some time

Cause the boys in the hood are always hard
You come talking that trash we'll pull your card
Knowing nothing in life, but to be legit
Don't quote me, boy, cause I ain't said shit

I went to get them out, but there was no bail
My niggas caused a riot in the county jail
Two days later in municipal court
Kilo G on trial straight cut a fart
Disruption of a court, said the judge
On a six-year sentence, my man didn't budge
Bailiff came over to turn him in
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin
He yelled out, ""Fire,"" then came Suzy
The bitch came in with a sub-machine Uzi
Police shot the girl, but didn't hurt her
Both upstate for attempted murder

Ah, real motherfuckin' G's
Ah, real motherfuckin' G's
Ah, real motherfuckin' G's
Ah, real motherfuckin' G's
Ayo, Doctor, here's another proper track, and it's phat
Watch the sniper, time to pay the piper
And let that real shit provoke
See, you's a wannabe Loc and you'll get smoked and I hope
That your fans understand when you talk about sprayin' me
The same records that you makin' is payin' me
Motherfuck Dre! Motherfuck Snoop! Motherfuck Death Row!
Yo, and here comes my left blow
'Cause I'm the E-A-Z-Y-E and this is the season
To let the real motherfuckin' G's in
You're like a kid, you found a pup, and now you're dapper
But tell me, where the fuck you found an anorexic rapper?
Talkin' 'bout who you gon' squabble with and who you shoot
You're only sixty pounds when you're wet and wearin' boots
Damn, E, they tried to fade you on Dre Day
But Dre Day only meant Eazy's payday
All of a sudden Dr. Dre is the G Thang
But on his own album covers he was a she-thang
So, nigga please, nigga please
Don't step to these motherfuckin' real G's

Boy, you should've known—

Every day it's a new rapper claimin' to be dapper than the Dresta
Softer than a bitch but portray the role of gangsta
Ain't broke a law in your life
Yet every time you rap you yap about the guns and knife
Just take a good look at the nigga and you'll capture
The fact that the bastard is simply just an actor
Who mastered the bang and the slang and the mental
Of niggas in Compton, Watts, and South Central
Never ever once have you ran with the turf
But yet in every verse claim you used to do the dirt
But tell me, who's a witness to your fuckin' work?
So you never had no business, so save the drama, jerk!
Niggas straight kill me, knowin' that they pranksters
This is goin' out to you studio gangstas
See, I did dirt, put in work, and many niggas can vouch that
So since I got stripes, I got the right to rap about that
But niggas like you, I gotta hate ya
'Cause I'm just tired of suburbia niggas
Talkin' about they come from projects
Knowin' you ain't seen the parts of the streets, G
Think you started tryna bang around the time of the peace treaty
Wearin' khakis and mob while you rhyme
Little fag tried to sag, but you're floodin' at the same time
And your set don't accept ya; scared to kick it with your homies
'Cause you know they don't respect ya
So, nigga please, check nuts
Before you step to these motherfuckin' real G's
Well, it's the Knocc Out, definition ""Original baby gangsta""
Approach me like you hard, motherfucker, I'ma bank ya
Shank ya, with my fuckin' shank, if I have to
Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy Dogg are fuckin' actors
Pranksters, studio gangstas, busters
But this time you're dealin' with some real motherfuckers
G's, nigga please, don't try to step
'Cause if you do, then a peeled cap is all that would be left
See, young niggas like me will break you off somethin'
Claimin' my city — but Dre, you ain't from Compton
Niggas like y'all is what I call wannabes
And ain't shit compared to real motherfuckin' G's

Stop him in his tracks, show him that I am Ruthless
Yo, Dre! (What's up?)

I never met a O.G. who never did shit wrong
You tried to diss the Eazy-E, so now, nigga, it's on
You and your Doggy Dogg think that y'all hoggin' shit
Both of you bitches can come and suck my doggy dick
Beatin' up a bitch don't make you shit, but then again
Some niggas think it makes a man
Damn, it's a trip how a nigga could switch so quick
From wearin' lipstick to smokin' on chronic at picnics
And now you think you're bigger
But to me you ain't nothin' but a bitch-ass nigga
That ain't worth a food stamp
And at Death Row, I hear you gettin' treated like bootcamp
Gotta follow your sergeant's directions
Or get your ass popped with the Smith & Wesson
Learn a lesson from the Eaze
Stay in your place and don't step to real motherfuckin' G's

What the fuck is up? (Sup)
In the place to be (Be)
Coming on the mic is Eazy-mothafuckin-E (E)
Dre is on the beat, Yella's on the cut
So listen up close while we rip shit up
(Shit up, shit up, shit up, shit up)

Well I'm Eazy-E, I got bitches galore
You may have a lot of bitches, but I got much more
Wit my super-duper group coming out the chute
Eazy-E, motherfuckers, cold knocking the boots
'Cause I'm a hip-hop thugster, I used to be a mugster
If you heard dopeman, you think I own a drugstore
Getting stupid because I know how
And if a sucker talks shit, I give him a (POW)
8-ball sipping, the bitches are flipping
Slow down, I hit a dip and, continue my tripping
Hitting my switches, collect from my bitches
The money that I make, so I can add to my riches
Fill my stash box and start rubbing my gat
Feeling good as hell because my pockets are fat
A hardcore villain cold roaming the streets
And wit a homie like Dre just supplying the beats

Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it

(""What's your name, boy?"")
(""Funky, fresh Eazy-E"")
(""Kick, kick that shit"")
(""Where you from, fool?"") (""Compton"") (""Yeah!"")

Rolling through the hood, cold tearing shit up
Stick my head out the window and I say what's up
To the niggas on the corner cold bumping the box
But you know that's an alibi for slanging the rocks
A dice game started so I said, ""What the fuck?""
So I put my shit in park and had to try my luck
Hard to roll wit my bitch jocking 24-7
Rolled them muthafuckas, ate 'em up, hit 11 (Rock that shit, homie!)
Got another point, I made a ten a fo'
Was taking niggas money and was itching for mo'
Laughing in their faces and said you're all making me rich
'Til one punk got jealous, cold slap my bitch
He pulled out his gat, I knew he wouldn't last
So I said to myself, homeboy, you better think fast
He shot (*pow, pow*), then I shot (*gunshots*)
As you can see, I cold smoked his ass (Haha!)
Because I'm a gangsta having fun
Never leave the pad without packing a gun
Hitting hard as fuck, I make you ask what was it

Muthafuckin' Eazy does it
(But how does he do it)
""Eazy duz it, do it eazy, that's what I'm doing""
(""Stop!"") (Man, whatcha gonna do now?)

Now I'ma break it down just to tell a little story
Straight out the box from the gangsta category
About a sucker, a sucker muthafucka
He's addicted, he's a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house car and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must've been starving 'cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out
Now I'm wanted for a murder that I had to commit
Yeah, I went to jail, but that wasn't shit
Got to the station about a quarter of nine
Call my bitch to get me out, 'cause I was down for mine
The bitch was a trip, cold hung up the phone
Now my only phone call was in the ganking zone
All the shit I did for her like keeping her rich
I swear when I get out, I'm gonna kill the bitch
Well by now you should know it was just my luck
The bailiff of the station was a neighborhood cluck
I looked him straight in the eye and said what's up
And said let's make a deal, you know I'll do you up
Now back on the streets and my records are clean
I creeped on my bitch wit my Uzi machine
Went to the house and kicked down the do'
Unloaded like hell, cold smoked the ho

We're sitting here with Eazy-E
Believe that
How are you doing?
Alright
So, Eazy, tell me, how was your life as a youngster?

Ruthless, my style as a juvenile
Ran with a gang, slanged in the meanwhile
Bankin', I specialized in gankin'
Whites, Mexicans, brothers and others
Daily, it's all about comin' up
Makin' sure no punks are runnin' up
Because I'm a gangsta havin' fun​
Strapped with a gat when I'm walkin' through Compton
Terrible, I never listened to my mother
It went in one ear and out the other
Ran my gang, sold undercover
Call a girl out a name, yo, I ain't no lover
I'm a pimp, mack daddy, lookin' for the dollar
At thirteen I bought a six-four Impala
Rollin' and runnin' from the police
Brother, don't you know you can't trust a thief
Or thug, convict, hoodlum or criminal?
Leave your car open, gank for your stereo
Hard and raw, no regard for the law
Eazy-E, were you ever caught slipping? Hell nah
Just trippin' off 8-ball
And girls ain't nothin' but female dogs to me
Bitches, I'm sorry for that verse
It's in my nature, I gotta curse
Out anybody gettin' on my nerves
You get beat, ganked, broke and served
So you know who I am
And if you don't like it, I really don't give a damn
You might also like
Hmm, I see, so you're rather violent?
Sometimes
Okay, what would be the situation when you so-call ""gank"" someone?
Waitin' for some people to leave
I got another trick up my sleeve
Step with pep to the back of the house
Looked in, all the lights are out
Grabbed the door and it's locked, so
Easily made my way to the window
Lift it up slow 'cause it takes timing
Looked around and then I climbed in
Once inside, I start takin'
'Cause you know, it's no time for shakin'
Get what you gonna get, front and center
Or get five years for breakin' and enter
Move quickly, but no runnin'
Shh, I think somebody's comin'
Hear the front door key and I flee
Out the back with a fist full of jewelry
Over the wall, don't fall
Wipe my sweat 'cause that was a close call
Gettin' ganked by the E is a lesson
So is there any more questions?
Yes, as a matter of fact, there is
Have you ever been involved in, like, an armed robbery or a hold-up?
You mean a two-eleven?
Yeah
There's a store, but don't point
Walk inside, case the joint
One man behind the counter, another in the back
Go out to the car and load the gat
Grabbed the ski mask, here's the task
Go in broke, come out with cash
Were you slick? Yeah, you gotta be cunnin'
Told Ice Cube to leave the car runnin'
Walked in, said, ""This is a robbery""
Didn't need the money, it's just a hobby
Fill the bag, homeboy, don't lag
I want money, beer, and a pack of Zig-Zags
The man in the back had a camera
So he came out to test his stamina
Against Eazy-E, but he took one
Fell to the floor, so I run
Back to the bucket, then I said, ""Punch it""
Took the gun and then dumped it
I'm not like Robin Hood, 'cause I want more
Steal from the rich, hang with the poor
My pockets are fat, you see, it don't matter to me
I feel like nobody is badder than me
Is all that true? I don't lie
You see, I'm not Mr. Nice Guy
Oh, so you're not exactly a role model?
Not exactly
And for your listeners, what does Eazy-E think of himself?

Bad and bold, you can't get with this
Those that tried, you're on my shit list
Can't be caught, sought or fought
Taught, and damn sure bought
Down and dirty from the C-P-T
N.W.A and Eazy-E
One more, before we end this session
What's your real age? No more questions24Embed",https://images.genius.com/073c2018de707a5a16a7b26a24c3b135.438x438x1.jpg

Today's a good day to die (*screaming*)
Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay
Suck on these nuts, nigga, suck on these nuts
I tell 'em bow-wow-wow yippie-yo yippie-yay
Suck on these nuts, nigga, suck on these nuts
It ain't nothin' but Eazy baby
He'll smoke two niggas 'cause they crazy
Talk a gang of shit but it don't phase me
That punk nigga Dre still pays me

Well, if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on, G
Now if it's on, motherfucker, then it's on, G
Hey mister prankster, prankster
Story book gangsta
Back in '86 you wore the pumps and mascara
Down with the motherfuckin' Wreckin' Cru, bitch
But once a bitch is always a bitch and now the fuckin' switch
Fag, with stethescope now you sag
Body slammin' bitches make Dre a bigger man
Khaki sportin' Locs in a G ride
What set you from punk what set you from ride
Rip Van Winkle sleepin', nigga woke up and became a G
But you still don't impress the Eazy
Smoke a lil' sherm, now you call that shit the chronic
Niggas on the westside call it bionic
I make a mil' here, make a mil' there
Fuck a bitch here, fuck a bitch there, yeah

P for the pussy wussy wuffin' nigga broke
As a motherfuckin' joke
Talkin' about you wanna smoke
The E to the A-Z-Y
Nigga this east side
Snoop Doggy Doggy Dogg, you wanna try?
187 on the E that you sing
But you cling on my balls when I swing my ding-a-ling
Yeah, ya got more juice like a plant of puppy water
First I'm gonna choke ya
Then I smoke ya, then I'm gonna
Toss you in the back of my trunk
With the other punk

Still a nigga, once a nigga, always a nigga, down from the get-go
Never let go, never flossin'
Never slippin', never trippin', stickin'
Dick and my balls down your throat, doggy, listen
Niggas from the LBC, they never heard of ya, G
And niggas from the CPT ain't down with D-R-E
But you gave it up still, like a trooper
Let 'em play your jam, shake your hand and then they shoot ya
You can fool the people on the east coast and the mid-west
But In LA, you still can't pass the test
See, I can tell a pussy when I see one
Dre wearing lip stick that mean ya have to be one
You need to change your sex and your occupation

Nigga evidently, ya just don't know who ya fucking with
So I suggest get in ya shit and keep truckin', bitch
Before I get my gat ya pressure case
Blast, blast, I leave my gang rag layin' on ya face
I tattoo Dre name on my chest
Cross it out just another nigga that I X-ed, huh
And you won't see R.I.P., you'll see P.N.D
A Punk Nigga Deceased, yeah
And the bitch that was yours will be mine, buddy
All because ya woofed on a nigga that was nutty
And I had to make an example
Nigga thinks I'm crazy now but that was just a sample
Of a nigga with street wise reality
That don't give a fuck type Compton mentality
I stare back death right in the face
Contemplate my last day on and everyday base
Cause a nigga never know when he go
I hope it only takes one shot
Cause I don't wanna die slow
My funeral will be full of my peers
People that never gave a fuck about me droppin' phony tears
I hope I'm in the casket face down
So all you motherfuckers can kiss my black ass now
And fuck all that cryin' all night
Just be happy that I'm rid of this fucked up life, yeah
And now you see you can't handle me

*Kissing sounds*
Well, what you want, baby?
Would you tell me a story?
You want me to tell you a story?
Hell yeah, me too!
Yes, honey, I'mma tell you a story about the bad-ass Eazy-E, he was drinking whisky and gin at the age of three. Listen and listen well, he's a bad motherfu-
Gimmie that god damn book! Here, let me read you this one. Christmas in Compton. It was a silent night, yes, a holy night until Mr. Claus turned into Santa muthafuckin' Wright

Deck the hall with boughs of holly
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!
'Tis the season to be jolly
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!
*Gunshots*

Merry muthafuckin' Christmas and a ho ho ho!
While I'm riding that cock under the mistletoe
Now dashing through the snow
In a candy red top 6-4 (Hittin' them switches)
Over the hills I go
Laughing at this ho
Nuts on her chin ring
Making me feel right
Oh what fun it is to know
That I'm gonna get this pussy tonight
So ring them bells, ring them bells
She's taking it all the way
Oh what fun it is to watch her suck my dick this way, hey
Ring them bells, ring them bells
She's taking it all the way
Oh, what fun it is to nut while she's sucking my dick
Okay, stop!

Get some Rudolph the red nose reindeer
Getcha that gum like a everlastin' gobstopper
Give me a hump for his cock will be the party poppa
I dig a ho, crack a dough by the nuts oh

I said here's some candy canes eat'em up
I send him down, they jumping down, swinging by my toes
Send me some cheese, I want the candy cream and the loot
I want Santa to send me a little jack horny guy
I want him to shake me a clunchy for a chick prod
So all on the hunt, bon appetite
And a condom in a tree

All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
My two front teeth, my two front teeth
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth
Yo where's ya rhyme tell me Buckwheat
Buckwheat is a wascal
That's no Christmas
And all the toys, boys and girls
Fuck ya wishes
I not happy, overjoyed in this motherfucker
No indo under my tree so Santa be a sucker
No shit on the roof, cough up Rudolph's nuts
When I was young I was the only kid
Who had enough guts to be
Good ole hearing on the East
I'd stay awake just to let America know
That Santa was a fake
I used to believe in Saint Dick when Elvis was alive
But all the fucking bullshit got played when I was five
Years old, just stay young, bold writing
Singing ""Silent Night"", caroling, reciting
Now all I want for Christmas is my indo wreath
I got my two front teeth
Uncle Eazy be the jeezy and just spread me a leaf
Little kids, don't cry
When you find out the Santa Claus is just a fucking lie

On the third day of Christmas, my homeboys gave to me
Three pounds of indo
Two birds of cocaine
And a A, muthafuckin' K, bitch
Eazy-E, oh, Eazy-E
Show us how you treat those bitches
I saw mommy fucking Eazy Claus
Close the door, little bitch, I'm getting these draws
I'ma tell my daddy if ya ass don't stop
I don't give a fuck, I'm getting Christmas cock
Ho, ho, ho and away I go
Oh Saint Nick's got a dick like a pole
Well, where's our shit?
This motherfucker's cheap
Shut the fuck up, bitches and go back to sleep
Yo black, what you want for Christmas?
(Yo black, I want a job)
For my Christmas, all the fucked up people
Want some corn-on-the-cob
A Jew will eat some matzoh ball soup, but a nigga'll eat some
Chitlins, watermelon, cornbread, and some Froot Loops
Now who's caroling in my window
Smokin' up indo
Mechalecha hi, make a high note

Get out my fucking yard with your camel
You wanna get busy and Santa like a..

The Atban Klann will make shit slam, it's Christmas time
The Simple Simon Christmas make me jam, jam, jam

The world is at its end, fuck it
We want the money and the power
And go out with a bang

It's the end of the world
And still niggas ain't got no satisfaction
So I take my nine, put it on my set, bust a cop in his head
Now I'm blastin'
'Cause I'm known as a G
And I'm comin' from the C-P-T

This is a real life jack in progress
Nigga, give up your shit or take two to the chest with the cripness
'Cause I ain't fuckin' around, G
So take a look at a real live nigga that's crazy
And get ready to die, loc
Any last words before your ass gets smoked?
It ain't a joke
Because my pockets is broke, my friend
That's why I gotta do you in
Give up your ends and your gold and your brand new Nikes
And anything else I might like
And then I'm off in the wind again
To catch the next sucker slippin', takin' two to the chin
I'm on a roll, two niggas in one night
Didn't even have to fight
Just pulled out my 9 to end another's life
That's real life so forget the silly shit you heard

Another murder I committed made front page
A nigga dead from a drive-by, did him with a 12 gauge
The first stage of insanity
People say it ain't wise to get faded off the St. Ides
A mother cries, another son lies in a casket
Life was fun while it lasted
That silly bastard had to get caught slippin' and set trippin'
You should have seen that niggas blood drippin'
Too many lives took, too many hearts broke
But you don't hear me, you just see my fuckin' gun smoke
Some ask why do I take so many lives from the innocent little ones
But where I come from we take shit real
You peel caps so you get your fuckin' cap peeled
Grab your steel, forget about what you heard
It's do or die, nigga
Any last words?

Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up
Wet 'em up, wet 'em up, wet 'em up

I got the 9 and I'm finna straight creep
Feel I need to take another's life, so I peep
Checkin' the scene but stayin' low so I'm not seen
'Case I gotta get away, gotta make the shit clean, G
So I'm lookin' for a victim
Gotta be right, took my time and I picked 'em
Scoped shit, then I licked him
Now I'm back in the news, no clues but yet another murder
You should have heard the nigga squeal when I stuck his ass
I had to grin 'cause it's funny, nigga, fuck his ass
He ain't the last and surely ain't the first, G
But his monkey ass rolled away in a hearse, G
So I'm feelin' somewhat relieved
Just another day in the life of the Eazy
A real G, so forget the silly shit you heard
It's do or die, Eazy-E gets that last word
'Cause it's the end of the world

Yo Ren, you're ready to go get this money?
Believe that, boy
You're strapped?
Yeah, you know it
Let's go do this shit, man, I got it all planned out
Yeah, shoot any motherfucker that moves!
Alright, everybody!

This is a stick-up! Everybody, get face-down!
Ren, gag their mouths so they can't make a sound
Tie 'em up for the fact that I'm kickin' ass
I got my hand on my gat, and I'm tempted to blast
My name is Eazy, but I go the hard way out
This ain't personal, but now I'm about
To commit a crime and go through it
You know what? No need for shaking because I'm used to it
Take out the security guard with a slap of my hand
Yeah, he's wearing a badge, but he's a old ass man
Pop his ass in the head and take his gun
So me and the punk can go one-on-one
Cover the lens on the TV screen
You know, so me and my gang just can't be seen
Lock the doors, and throw away the key
Close the blinds, so no motherfuckers could see
And smile, you know, 'cause I'm controllin' the shit
And no sucker ass niggas gonna stop the hit
Wardrobes and locs and a Ruthless shirt
That means I'm ready to work and rush a fool to the dirt, so—

Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

Alright, anybody move and I'll blow your fucking head off!

Alright, empty your pockets, but do it slow
Take everything you got and lay it on the fuckin' floor
Don't make me have to set an example today
And blow one of you crazy motherfuckers away
I'm in a bank, and it's a little bit funny
Taking all you stupid motherfuckers' money
Peepin' at a bitch 'cause my dick's on hard
Laughing at the dumbass security guard
Who's tied up for the moment, not saying a word
I should have known it before, the motherfucker's a nerd
But back to the bitches I'm peepin'
And then untie the hoe, so I can start creepin'
Took her to the backroom, about to jack
Cold trailed the bitch with a gun in her back
I said: ""Lay down, and unbutton your bra!""
There was the biggest titties that a nigga ever saw
I said: ""Damn!"", then the air got thinner
Only thought in my mind was going up in her
The suspense was making me sick
She took her panties down and the bitch had a dick!
I said: ""Damn!"", dropped the gat from my hand
What I thought was a bitch, was nothing but a man
Put the gat to his legs, all the way up his skirt
Because this is one faggot that I had to hurt, so—
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

I said, get down! I want you all face-down on the floor
Anybody moves and I shoot!

Stacking up the money and there's more to collect
'Cause I don't give a fuck, I take traveler's checks
Yo, Ren, peep out the window, and tell me what you see
Three motherfucking police staring at me!
What to do now?—Hurry up and get armed
Alright, tell me, who hit the motherfucking alarm?
I'ma give ya a chance and count to three
Or else five of y'all bitches are comin' with me
(Alright, alright! Come on out niggas, or we're coming in
This is the only chance to turn yourself in)
Fuck you! We got hostages and plenty of loot
And don't give a damn and not afraid to shoot
We're sending out the hostages, all except five
And if you don't meet our demands, they won't stay alive
We want a 'copter, so we can get away clean
And take some pussy along, if you know what I mean
One hostage got brave, and got off the floor
But I smoked his ass before he got to the door
(They shot a hostage, they shot a hostage!)
You a stupid motherfucker trying to run
Now you're dead as fuck, trying to race a gun
(Alright, this is the last chance to get off your ass
Or else the tear gas is about to blast)
I ran to the back and Ren followed behind
To a hell of a spot that was hard to find
The bank was fucked up, the shit was smokin'
With screamin' hostages runnin' and chokin'
Getting' away, but I was suddenly stopped
At point-blank range by a motherfucking cop
And I hope they don't think that a lesson was taught
'Cause a nigga like the E was finally caught
My gat wouldn't fire, the shit wouldn't work
So... yo, y'all know what time it is
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get hurt

Well, I'm giving you five seconds to let us through the gate, or I'm gonna shoot two of your guards!

Get in that cell
Get in that cell
Hehe, they got me once, but they'll never get me again

Yo, man, I don't think they heard you?
Won't you tell 'em what your name is?

My name is Eazy, yeah, this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore, yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with a touch of my rhyme
Suckers stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Eazy or just call me E
But it doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin'
I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I cold get ill
But I'm like that and that's an actual fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo, I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who tries to cope
If the rhyme I'm displayin'
And the beat that's playin'
Yo, you could try all-day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
'Cause Eazy's doin' it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some
Yo, it's easier said than done
You might also like
Woo, woo!

Now it's easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model or a Dr. Seuss, yo I'm a gangsta
And I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trauma
With the E-A-Z-Y-E comma now that's drama
So pay attention by the way I must mention
I'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
With the glare
But you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like you're there
With the E on the gangsta tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
'Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Dre is a doctor, not a lawyer
Dope MC employer on Ruthless and that's my label
To get the money, the women, and cold bust the fat cables, boy
Master Rhyme's a toy
I mean straight, while you suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick, or you lonely
How you gonna diss me if you don't even know me?
Yo Ren! (Whassup?)
Get the gat show 'em where it's at
And that's just the sound
And next time I'm peelin' your cap
To let you know where I'm comin' from
Eazy said it and it shall be done
Woo, woo!

Creating dope jams is a part of the cycle
""Eazy-er Said Than Dunn"", yeah, that's the title
Lovin' the ladies, only the fly ones, ya know?
But what if she's ugly?
Eazy come Eazy go
Don't ask to battle me, homeboy, what's that?
You wanna battle me? Boy, ya better be strapped
'Cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
Now, that's what I'm sayin'
Said before that I was born in '73
Now everybody wants to know the A-G-E
Girls on the tip, fellas too, it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15
The fellas would ignore me
The ladies would adore me
And what was I to do?
I wish they’d let the ladies through
'Cause the ladies, I love 'em
Nice, tender and soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real Eazy, those others be fakin'
Tryin' to gain fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some

I got my niggas from the C-P-T
I got my niggas all across the mothafuckin' land
That's down with the E-A-Z-Y-E

Now, early in the mornin' I awake
Thinkin' about this dead fool's life that I had to take
Frontin' on a true name, I peep game at point-blank range
Fuck 'em! (Mothafuckin' right, y'all)
Back to the set as I jet
Not givin' a fuck about the nigga that I wet
That's what he gotta shout for actin' like a trick
Now he's six feet and I'm deep in his bitch
Creepin', creepin', creepin' on the marks that be sleepin'
Catch you slippin', slap the clip in, buck 'em every weekend
A scandalous lil' nigga with no heart to feel remorse
Dig the nigga's corpse, leave it on his momma's porch
Don't give a fuck about shit, that's why I'm mellow
Or maybe it's the fact that I'm kin to the Devil
A psychopathic nigga that's always quick to fill a
Nigga full of lead, 'cause I'm a mothafuckin' killer
Thrilla from Manila, though I'm shorter than the average
Try to test yo' luck and get bucked by a mothafuckin' savage

Lookin' for a nigga I can gat and pack a hole in
Stoppin' at a light on the late night
Fire up a Philly blunt to get my head right
See some niggas slippin' at a burger stand
And in my mind all I'm thinkin' is a murder plan
Creepin' through the drive-through kinda slow
I got my hot beams on the back of the '4, yo
Smokin' on chronic with the rag down
Not knowin' I'm about to lay their ass down
Reach for who was fool, make my move
Leaned out my jeep and I creep kinda smooth
With the gat to the nigga's dome, now he sleeps
One shot to the top, body flopped on the seat, peep
I dumped on the lil' skinny passenger
A bitch is screamin' in a rage, so I blasted her
Smashed and I got about five blocks
Before I got stopped by a punk-ass cop (Shit, fuck 'em!)

But I got something I want you motherfuckers to know
I really don't give a fuck

Niggas ain't shit in the 90's, I don't trust 'em
And bitches on my dick but they ain't shit, so motherfuck 'em
Eazy know's what's up, 'cause see he really don't give a fuck
'Cause it don't concern me if don't pertain to money or a nut
But then again I talk to a few of my friends
Nine times out of ten 'bout some ends or some skins
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that gotta have it like a rabbit
Rappin' is my hustle, bustin' ho's is a habbit
I stab it like a true no good nigga should
I do it the way a down O.G. nigga would
And now niggas know Eric Wright ain't no busta
Another platinum cut from the Compton thugsta
My name is ""Eazy-E""

Niggas wanna diss, fuck them and their whole crew

Hahahahaha!
Good evening and welcome to Eazy's playhouse, you stupid muthafucka!
Now that you got the album
What the fuck are you gonna do with it, bitch?

I knew this nigga back in, uh, uh—back since a nigga was little
(You lying, you lying man)
The nigga come from Compton, Michigan, nigga
(Compton, what? You ain't never met no Eazy-E)
Well, I'ma introduce him (You a damn liar!)
This is the craziest motherfucka you done seen (You a damn liar!)
This nigga's crazy—just listen!

Easily I approach
The microphone because I ain't no joke
Tell your momma to get off of my tip
I have no time to give her my dick
I'm gonna hold it, and walk around the stage and
If you fuck up, I'm goin' to get my gauge and
Unload the barrel and blast
'Cause I'm puttin' lead in your mothafuckin' ass
Psychopathic, but the hoes are attracted
Because when I'm on hard, my dick's at least a yard
In the days of old, I was a nut
Now I'll need at least 3 hoes when I fuck
'Cause I do a check—nut 1, nut 2
Then I save a nut for when there's nothin' else to do
Get used to the crew, bitch, 'cause I would never quit
As soon as you think that's it, I'm still talkin' shit
You might also like
Haha, I told you that nigga was crazy!
Eazy Eric, that's my boy, haha, godamnit!
Go on, boy, wit' yo' bad self!
Step up to the mic, nigga! (Ayy bitch, pass me my Ripple)

I got a fable that you need to listen to
It's a funky little rhyme about a bitch or a two
One's Sharon, the other one Shaun
I wanted to nut, but which one do I want?
Shaun said, ""Eazy, let me fuck you blind""
And Sharon said, ""E, I want to blow your mind""
I said, ""Fuck it, I know what should be done
Just pull your panties down and I'll fuck the biggest one""
And then I get the other pussy, put it in the freezer
So, I can always have a on-hold skeezer
Yeah, that's the ticket, I'll do it like that
So, I told the hoes to take a big step back
Took the zipper down, eyes wide, and said
""Here's what I'm gonna put inside""
Grab it like a rabbit (Grab it), let's work it (Work it)
But I won't love you—when I'm done, I'll still be talkin' shit...

Haha, that boy good! (Yeah, that boy's good)
(That muthafucka be talkin' all kinds of shit)
I used to get pussy like Eazy Eric every day!
(You ain't no motherfucker!) How you know, muthafucka?
(You're lyin', your dick can't get hard!)
Oh, suck my dick, muthafucka! (Nigga, you lyin')
Who you talkin' to? Well, get up then, nigga, shit...
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit
Ayo Yella boy, won't you rewind it

Niggas don't see I'm a 100 percent legit
And you know it ain't about all that bullshit
It's about fuckin' this bitch and that bitch
But not the bitch with the 7-day itch, like that ho
Just throwin' me the pussy
She says she wants to do it like a doggy
She's bad, nobody is badder
But she got more crabs than a seafood platter
Bitch on the gank move,  to skeaze me
Just to say, ""I got fucked by Eazy!""
So, I slapped the ho like a pimp
I might be a woman-beater, but I'm not a pussy-eater
So, when the shit hits the fan, it's outta my mouth
You don't like what I'm talkin' about?
All of y'all can just suck my dick
You could quote me now 'cause I'm still talkin' shit

The boy's good—I told you, boy!
(Ayy, I knew him when he was knee-high)
The nigga got talent—you don't know a damn thing!
(I knew him when he was knee-high)
He still is knee-high, muthafucka!
(Yeah, I like that part—bring that shit back one more time, Maestro)
That's that old Z.Z. Hill, huh? Ha-ha-ha!
I tell ya, boy, I can do the Mashed Potato, nigga, what can you do?

Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it

Can I get an eye open up?
Eazy locin' up, smokin' up
Much dust like a nut what
Give it up for the real stuff
Shut the what up
Back to shut up, what?
Hustler from the hood, ho
Hopping in my trunk
The finishing touches
Would show what rough is
Coming in bunches
Could serve like lunches
Hold ya horses, here's where the source is
Not very tall but never took a short kid
With a clip to claw
Quick Draw McGraw
I trick a law before all and all I'm raw
A naughty shorty, sporty with a forty
A lordy taking tours, just to plan an orgy
A nasty critter, any ho hitter
Hated my babysitter 'cause she wouldn't let me hit her

Now get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it

Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it

Here's something from the ding-dong
'Cause I really care how long ya been strong grown
Here comes permastoned cone
Couldn't hang with the king of the records
But I call for a yes, y'all toots
My style is just as fresh as a dusch bush
I push a record through a heifer just like woody wooder
And if I left, then that means that I should've booger
Here's a new track, for all the new jacks
I'm kicking it the hardest, so gimme my shoes back
So I limp when I step it's the pimp
And I rep Mr. Right, and get left quick
So try to play strong and long gone
The flow is kinda funky but far from Armstrong
Get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it

Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it
Only if you want it
Yes, I really want it

Ooh! A new jack! A new jack!
Kid, I swear I saw a puddy cat
Back, back smack, here comes a witty black
Enemies go hide, I'm 'bout to show why
Eazy's peeling caps 'cause my gats in the low ride
Bang when the gat speaks, two in the backseat
My homie rides shotgun waiting to spot one
Duz is a fool who don't run, duck, dive and slide to a ride
I'm shudder shaking the place when I start, hey
So don't butter me, Eazy-E but a Parkay
The only thing the flow needs now to be fly is a feather
I see the smiling faces in wilding places
You know me better, hard rotty, kid
Killed Cali, kid, now you know it, boy
Left up in the alley dead
Now get up on it, on and on get on it
And I will pump it, only if you want it

Only if you want it

Inside the minds of real G's
Death Row is looked upon as the studio gangstas of the 90's

You wasted 4 minutes
Now you got seconds left, kick it

Come on, come all, and let me ride, nigga

South Compton
And I put it on the map
So what up Dogg Pound Crip
You wanna scrap
And that's comin' straight from the ruthless gangsta Eazy-E
Now what would I do, haha, let's see
Now I would take out Suge and stomp down the row
Since Dre is a bitch pimp slap the ho (ba-by)
Now I'm seein' doubles, aw man
Two dogs in a huddle, aw goddamn

Don’t run or I’ll smoke that ass

Got my nuts on your chin
While I'm all in your philly ho
So come with it fool and test your luck and I'll beat that ass
Now call me Kurupt
Now I'm creepin' through the fog, yeah, big dog blue
Got my 9 milla-killa huntin' dog named Snoop
You can run nigga but you can't hide
Eazy-E straight creepin' on the east side

Found Snoop freebasin' in a rock house
I kicks in the door, I said it before

Treated like a prostitute
And we all know who's doin' the pimpin'

No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby

They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
Nobody's invincible, no plan is foolproof
We all must meet our moment of truth

The same sheisty cats that you hang with and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up nigga, peep the language
It's universal, you play with fire it may hurt you
Or burn you, lessons are blessings you should learn through
Let's face facts, although MC's lace tracks
It doesn't mean behind the scenes there ain't no dirt to trace back
That goes for all of us, there ain't nobody to trust
It's like sabotage, it's got me ready to bust
But I can't jeopardize what I have done up to this point
So I'ma get more guys to help me run the whole joint
Cultivate, multiply, motivate or else we'll die
You know I be the master of the who, what, where and why
See when you're shinin', some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish, jealous punks will wanna pull ya
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it to see your ass squirm like a worm
But just as you'll receive what is comin' to you
Everybody else is gonna get theirs too
I ain't no saint, therefore I cannot dispute
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
You might also like
Actions have reactions, don't be quick to judge
You may not know the hardships people don't speak of
It's best to step back, and observe with couth
For we all must meet our moment of truth

Sometimes you gotta dig deep when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
Seems that life is just a constant war between good and evil
The situation that I'm facin' is mad amazin'
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Now I'm contemplatin' in my bedroom pacin'
Dark clouds over my head, my heart's racin'
Suicide? Nah, I'm not a foolish guy
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really is accelerate
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But wait, I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So I oughta be able to withstand some more
But I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead I use my mind
I put down the knife and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
But they can't take the respect that I've earned in my lifetime
And you know they'll never stop the furious force of my rhymes
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
So I pray, rememberin' the days of my youth
As I prepare to meet my moment of truth
You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free!

Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head for start
Another one is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
I mack dimes, crack the spines of the fake gangsters
Yeah the bitin' triflin' niggas and the studio pranksters
Yo, lookin' at the situation plainly: will you remain, G?
Or will you be looked upon strangely?
I reign as the articulator with the greater data
Revolvin' on the TASCAM much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more to expose the core
A lot of emcees act stupid to me
And we have yet to see if they can match our longevity
But anyway, it's just another day
Another fake jack I slay with my spectac' rap display
Style's smooth but rugged, you can't push or shove it
You dig it and you dug it 'cause like money you love it
The king of monotone, with my own throne
Righteously violent prone, my words bring winds like cyclones
Stormin' your hideout, blockin' out your sunlight
Your image and your business were truly not done right
Throw up your He Allah Now Divine Saviors
You got no hand skills, there's no security to save ya
No pager, no celly, no drop top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse
'Cause you must meet your moment of truth
They say it's lonely at the top in whatever you do
You always gotta watch motherfuckers around you
No one is untouchable, no man is bulletproof
We all must meet our moment of truth79Embed",https://images.genius.com/39dd6e67430eb03560a6f59cba4945e6.800x800x1.jpg

But I'm cashin' checks with Premier on this jam

Like the Rap Reverend Ike without the perm', I preach
There's more you need to learn, I return for my streets
Gainin' my wealth, trainin' myself
For corny confrontation with haters who be playin' themselves

Guru flows forever like a diamond
The most could never afford the precious jewels
That's precisely why I'm blessin' you with clear-cut messages
I'm destined to invest in urban sections where depression rules
I hope to heal the destitute before I leave this vestibule
Between the heavens and the seven circles
Where some dead homies maybe rest, I plan to resurrect a few
I press the truth against the neck of devils
Look at the youth just like a precious pebble
Meant to be protected, mentally we let this
Poison of Western philosophy make us sloppy
We forgot we are the chosen
From hip-hop to astronomy, they copy what we showed 'em
Niggas be talkin' slick, but only try me over modems
In person they starstruck, they hearts flutter
I'm like the realest one you ever met
If you don't feel this one, give it a sec
Go live a little, let the years pass
Experience pain, watch the tears crash on to the floor
Hurt brings wisdom
Wisdom brings a whole 'nother sort of understandin'
Diamonds only worth what we demandin', uh, uh
And niggas payin' top-dollar
Once upon a time I paid a 100 for mine, now I'm a lot smarter
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought

I rock diamonds that cut glass out of window panes
Baldhead Slick blazing tracks when the indo's flame
Rocks that bling, rocks that make them jock my team
Rocks that shine, rocks that keep my hand on my nine
Rocks that blind, make the High Rocks drop down
One of a kind, niggas best jet from the spot when I cock mine
Diamonds are like your man you always call fam
Diamonds are like your grandma you always call ma'am
Diamonds are like having the whole world in your hand
Diamonds are like the shows I ripped with no band
Rockin' your knot, stoppin' your plot
It's me, Baldhead Slick Duke, coppin' your block
For you it's only pain, for me it's only gain
Diamonds are like loyalty, iced out like royalty
Diamonds are like my wifey, so sweet the way she spoils me
(So good)
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Diamonds are forever like family and loyalty
Or real rap songs like ""C.R.E.A.M."" or ""My Melody""
Diamonds are forever like my infinite thought
Like respect in the hood that can't be bought
Word up, diamonds

Big L, rest in peace!
Do you wanna mess with this
I'm one of the best yet
We got it
You can feel the realness
In this business of rap
Go ahead

Fresh out the gate again, time to raise the stakes again
Fatten my plate again, y'all cats know we always play to win
G-A-N-G to the Starr, son
Haters took this shit too far, son
So that's all for you, I'm wipin' out your whole team
I'll splatter your dreams with lyrics to shatter your schemes
The badder you seem, the more lies you tell
The more lies you sell, and by surprise, you fell
Into my deathtrap, right into my clutches
Stupid, you know the God must bless
Every single mic he touches
I've suffered, just so I could return harder
Wanna be the shit starter, fuck around, make you a martyr
I make you famous, turn around, then make you nameless
‘Cause you never understood how vital to me this rap game is
Save it and hold that, you catch a hot one
Rhymes chase a fake nigga down soon as I spot one

Learn that if you come against me, son, you're gonna have to pray
Since back in the day I held the weight and kept my head up
They wanna see the god catch an L, it's all a set-up
I give no man or thing power over me
Why these niggas so jealous and looking sour over me?
I'm bolder, G, I'm like impossible to stop
I'm like that nigga in the ring with you impossible to drop
I'm like two magazines fully-loaded to your one
Plus, I ain't gonna quit spittin' 'til you're done
Plus, more than ever I got my whole shit together
More than a decade of hits that'll live forever
Catchin' rep off my name, you're bound to fry
Know how many niggas that I know is down to die?

Just for the way you're looking at me
Cock back, blaow, I hit you up right now
I don't know why so many of y'all wanna be thugs anyhow
Face the consequence of your childish nonsense
I could make your head explode just by my lyrical content
Get you in my scope and metaphorically snipe ya
I never liked ya, I gas that ass and then ignite ya
The flamethrower, make your peeps afraid to know ya
How many times I told ya? Play your position, small soldier!
My heart is colder, makes me wanna resort to violence
Stop beating me in the head, son, nah, I'm not buyin' it
I'm ready to blast, ready to surpass and harass
I'm ready to flip, yeah, I'm ready to dip with all the cash
I hold my chrome steady with a tight grip
So watch your dome already, 'cause this one might hit

I say Muhammad Ali, you say Classius Clay
I say butter, you say Parkay
It's alright, if you wanna make a sway
I'm away uptown, took the deuce to the tre

Here's how it goes: I am a genius, I mean this
I shape this, you'll tape this, I'm kinda fiendish
You wish that you could come into my neighborhood
Meanin' my mental state, still I'm 5-foot-8
Crazy as I wanna be, ‘cause I make it orderly
You could say I'm sorta the boss, so get lost!
The brother who will make you change opinions
Dominions, I'm in 'em when it's time to kick shit from the heart
Plus, I get a piece of the action
Feelin' satisfaction from the street crowd reaction
Chumps pull guns when they feel afraid
Too late — when they dip in the kick, they get sprayed
Lemonade was a popular drink, and it still is
I get more props and stunts than Bruce Willis
A poet like Langston Hughes
And can't lose when I cruise out on the expressway
Leavin' the bodega, I say ""Suavé""
Premier's got more beats than barns got hay
Clips are inserted into my gun
So I can take the money, never have to run!
Yo, Keithy E, I left my Phillie at home, do you have another?
I wanna get blunted, my brother
Now, may I make a mark then make a spark
Over this phat track — or should I say dope beat?
Subtract, delete
All of the wick-wack that wanna be abstract
But they lack the new knack that's comin' from way, way back
Hey, yo, Premier, please pass that buddha sack
You heard we quit? No way, bullshit!
I told you before — we come back with more hits
I provide bright flavor, so you can sketch me
Do me a favor — don't try to catch me
Slightly ahead of the game, I'm not a lame
Ask him, he'll tell you the same, he knows my name
Smooth, I drop jewels like paraphernalia
I'm infallible, not into failure
Like a rhinoceros, my speed is prosperous
And pure knowledge expands from my esophagus
I write in the night to bring truth to the light
My dialogue is my own, ‘cause Smooth B will never bite

After the tour quits, I come back with more hits
After the tour quits, I come back with more hits

No way, you'll never make it
Come with the weak shit, I'll break it
Step into my zone, mad rhymes will stifle ya
Lines like rifles go blast when I kick some ass
A lot of rappers be like one-time wonders
Couldn't say a fly rhyme if there was one right under their noses
I hate those motherfuckin' posers
But I'm so real to them it's scary
And with my unique skills, nah, you can't compare me
And no, we don't make wack tracks
And all the suckers get pushed back when I'm kickin' real facts
I represent, set up shit like a tent, boy
You're paranoid 'cause you're a son like Elroy
And you'd be happy as hell to get a record deal
Maybe your soul you'd sell to have mass appeal

Niggas be pretendin' they're hardcore
Never know the meanin' of (raw)
But I get props like a slogan
And no man could ever try to diss when I kicks my jam
Lyrically def and connectin', complete mic-wreckin'
No double-checkin', vocals kill like weapons
But if I have to, I go all out with no mic
Yeah, that's right, 'cause I survived mad fights
And for my peeps I truly care
'Cause without some of them I wouldn't be here
And they all know how I feel
'Cause suckers be like playin' themselves to have mass appeal

I've suffered setbacks, but now I'm makin' greenbacks

Check one two and you don't stop
Your head'll bop when I drop my crop of pure bomb
Just like the seashore, I'm calm but wild
With my monotone style
Because I don't need gimmicks
Gimme a fly beat and I'm all in it
Word is bond, I go on and on
For you it's tragic, I got magic like wands
So I'ma end this lecture and I bet ya

That makes me know that what we're doing
We had the right idea in the beginning
And and we just need to maintain our focus and elevate
We what we do we update our formulas
We have certain formulas but we update em (oh right)
With the times and everything y'know
So y'know the rhyme style is elevated
The style of beats is elevated but it's still Guru and Premier
And it's always a message involved

The real (The real)
Hip-hop (Hip-hop)
MCing (MCing), and DJing (DJing)
From your own mind (From your own mind)
You know? (You know?)
I, I guess right now we should start the show

Who's the suspicious character
Strapped with the sounds profound?
Similar to rounds spit by Derringers
You're in the Terrordome, like my man Chuck D said
It's time to dethrone you clones and all you knuckleheads
‘Cause MC's have used up extended warranties
While real MC's and DJ's are a minority
But right about now, I use my authority
‘Cause I'm like the Wizard, and you look lost like Dorothy
The horror be when I return for my real people
Words that split wigs hittin' like some double Desert Eagles
Sportin' caps pulled low, and baggy slacks
Subtractin' all the rappers who lack over Premier's tracks
Severe facts have brought this rap game to near collapse
So as I have in the past, I whoop ass
Droppin' lyrics that be hotter than sex and candle wax
And one-dimensional MC's can't handle that
While the world's revolvin' on its axis
I come with mad lovin', plus the illest warlike tactics
The wilderness is filled with this
So many people searchin' for false bliss
I'm here with the skills you've missed
The rejected stone is now the cornerstone
Sorta like the master builder when I make my way home
You know my steez

I be bringin' salvation through the way that I rap
And you know, and I know, I'm nice like that
Work through worldly problems, I got the healing power
When the mic's within my reach, I'm feelin' more power
Stealin' at least three minutes of every rap radio hour
It's often easier for one to give advice
Than it is for a person to run one's own life
That's why I can't be caught up in all the hype
I keep my soul tight and let these lines take flight
The apparatus gets blessed, and suckers get put to rest
No more of the unpure, I got the cure for this mess
The wackness is spreadin' like the plague
MC's lucked up and got paid
But still can't make the fuckin' grade
How many times are wannabes gonna lie?
Yo, they must wanna fry
They can't touch the knowledge I personify
I travel through the darkness carryin' my torch
The illest soldier, when I'm holdin' down the fort

Styles more tangible, and image more real
For some time now, I've held the scrolls and manuscripts
When it's time to go all out, you be like, ""Damn, he flipped!""
Now I'm sick, fed up with the bullshit
Got the lyrical full clip, givin' you a verbal asswhip
Don't trip, it's the gifted prolific one
Known as Bald Head Slick, why is the press all on my di-dick?

Don't try it, I'm about to start more than a friggin' riot
Styles unsurpassable, and nuccas that's suckas

Or it gets tragic like the havoc of a nuclear bomb

And jealous so-called friends'll try to set you up

Check the horror scene
The kid was like twelve or thirteen
Never had the chance like other kids to follow dreams
Watched his father catch two in the dome and to the spleen
Nothin' but blood everywhere, these streets are mean
They spared his life, but killed his moms and his sister Jean
Of course over some drug shit
His pops was on some ill-out, spill your guts, on some thug shit
Didn't know his boys was on some shady, no love shit
His pops got played out though, with silencers they laid him out yo
Took his stash and all the cash and left 'em, tied up on the couch yo
With tape over his mouth, so he couldn't cry out
Cause his dad was the nigga with clout
Survival of the fittest so they split his wig no doubt
Despite the stocking caps he noticed the same cat, who used to give him dough
And taught him, to use the same gat
Supposed to be an Uncle, fam and all that
He could tell that it was him cause he had on the same slacks, he wore when
He took him to Meadowlands racetrack
Why did he flip and go out like that?
It's called betrayal
Scandalous, money greed and lust
In this trife life, there ain't nobody you can trust

It's called betrayal)
He on a mission to become a ball player
Flip big Benz's, flossin' all gators
Had it all mapped out, a 6'8"" 12th grader
Fresh outta school and finna go make paper
He had a brother who was hustlin', collectin' his change
Never let his baby brother stick his neck in the game
Told him all he had to do is just enjoy the ride
And he ain't have to worry about money cause that's in time
So now he's pacin' as the time moves slowly
Can't wait to face Shaquille in the paint and school Kobe
Kept his grades and stayed up under neighborhood functions
And then a group of knuckleheads came through dumping
So now he's sittin' on the sidewalk bleeding
Fell into a puddle of his own blood and stopped breathin'
And everybody in the neighborhood still grievin'
But destiny caught up with his ass and he got even
And all the cryin' in the world ain't goin' to bring him back
His brother, sittin' at the wake wipin' tears from his mother's eyes
Why'd the game have to go and take the young boys life
Only the wicked live shife, payin' the price
While he's starin' at the shell his brother's soul once held
The trigger man made bail
And you, wouldn't pay the boy his mail, and sacrificed your fuckin' family
That's betrayal
Betrayal (echoes)
Scandalous, money greed and lust

Yeah well your boy Guru got knocked
WHAT?!
I don't know what this is about, sounds crazy man
Something about a gun
""The court calls Keith Elam to the stand
Please approach the bench.""

Yo they got me handcuffed, I'm down in central booking
Things are fucked up, the way my future's looking
But I'm too fly, I'mma change this scenario
Make some power moves and tighten up my bankroll
Chumps are leary though, they see me as a threat
I'm like the black Dutch Schultz when you get me upset
5-0 makes me wanna flip, Larry Davis style
Got a nigga depressed, while he's awaiting trial
It's OK though, cause from grey skies come blue
Through darkness comes light and I be known as the Guru
And this I certify we all should be alerted by
The traps within the system our youth is getting murdered by
The D.A. says they got me on a felony
I'm trying to live my life, so what the fuck is you telling me?
The streets are war, that's what brothers carry weapons for
And I take the weight as I did before
The next thing you know, they got me on the radio
A rapper arrested, suckers showing me on video
Of course I know that I'm a role model
But yo, this rap life is real life: sometimes it's full throttle
Right now I gotta think about me; fuck the industry
You gets no love except those who support me
What's the story? What happened when I went to L.A.?
Mixing shit up, no not there I got family
Nothing happened, mind your business, yo, step
You know we connect - JFK to LAX

They wanna lock us all up, and throw away the key
Don't wanna see us come up, don't wanna see us making G's
Long as we know this is the key to our destruction
Let's make moves, no discussion

Peace to my man Hass, an Orange Man paying the cost
All the twenty-five-to-lifers, all my brothers getting tossed
Into the system, supposed to rehabilitate
It's why you gotta regulate your own mindstate
Read, study lessons and build your inner power
The next level, doesn't tolerate cowards
For example, I know this rich Nigerian
Powerful American that's proud to be an African
He asked me why do all us brothers be getting trapped
I told him I'd explain it, broke it down in a rap
Whether you got naps, braids waves or no hair
Without esteem for yourself, nigga, you going nowhere
And you can swagger like you rude as Josey Wales
Unorganized revolt almost always mostly fails
Give up the savage ways, be effective soldiers
To elevate the mental is to be poor no more
There's war in the streets, prepared men know best
I rhyme as live as it gets, JFK to LAX
They're always making trouble yo, against the righteous
Killing us in cold blood, those beasts, those vipers
And as I sit feeling the pain in my wrist
I vow to myself that I'ma change this shit
Or at least I gotta try or part of me will die
And only by action will any ideas solidify
So I inhale, exhale as I ponder
This grown man will make mistakes no longer
I've been there, I've seen how they make us fall victim
To their tricknowledgy, with no apology I diss em
And so I rip facts, to dope tracks I caress
You're gonna hear about it, from JFK to LAX10Embed",https://images.genius.com/39dd6e67430eb03560a6f59cba4945e6.800x800x1.jpg

One of the meanest and the cleanest
And still I'm kind of fiendish when I'm at this
Been doin' this for eons, peons best to catch this
Vision of excellence precise rappin' ability
'Bout to make some dead presidents, mackin' a million, G
The money though, it's got people acting funny yo
As soon as some niggas get some light, they be like dummies yo
Products and puppets and pawns, gettin' played out
When authentic niggas step up, respect be layed out
Major effect to your sector, I'm the corrector
Live and direct, wavin' my mic like a sceptor
Supreme exalted, universal leader
Descendent of the kings and queens, the overseer
The overlord, cream of the crop, crème de la crème
Spent years building with cats in the streets so they my men
Again, Gang Starr has done it
Remember too much jewels back in the days? You'd have to run it
Check it, the ground be hot under our feet
So we be listenin' to beats to keep the cypher complete
Whether you kids be holdin' on the block all day
Or you be puffin' lye out in the back hallway
Or whether you be in school or in the library
Wherever you are, baby paw, realize that your essence
Is divine, son, and let it shine, son, as we refine, son

Whatever I choose, I choose to do
I just wanna stand out from all the rest

And all the girls they want to spoil me
My honey anoints me with oils, G
After work she greets me and treats me like royalty
Works with me, givin' herself by my side
She don't sweat me for loot, my fame or my ride
A lot of ladies out there be lookin' lovely
But they don't got no control of their life, inside they're ugly
Word to Bugsy, and to Red Alert
Sway and Tech, and Funkmaster Flex to make your head jerk
Chicks go beserk when they see us in the spot
K-Ci, JoJo and Primo, creepin' to the top
And to the sweethearts out there breakin' hearts
While we're takin' part of this hip-hop art
Listen yo, the best way, it ain't always the fast way
And yes, the best way, it ain't always to act nasty
I'll open up the door always before you pass me
Baby Doll, because you're royalty
Whatever I do, wherever I go
I won't accept nothin' less than the best
Whatever I choose, I choose to do

To whom it may concern
This goes out to anybody who’s doing the bullshit, straight up
Yo, everybody’s calling me, my lawyer, everybody on this, ‘yo did you scratch such n such name?
Or this, that, and the third on the record for a hook?’
Y’all keep calling me on that shit and y’all supposed to be hip hoppers and all that, and letting the industry control the rules of the hip hop world that we made?
Y’all need to knock that shit off, that’s some greedy-ass, fake bullshit!
Knock that shit off for real!
Y'know'm sayin'?
And when that shit come and slap you in the face, that greed, I’ma be right there laughing at y’all…
And one other thing… What’s the deal with you break-record cats putting out all the original records that we sample from and snitching by puttin us on the back of it sayin we used stuff?
You *know* how that go!
Stop doing that, y’all are violatin', straight up and down!
Word up, man, I’m sick of this shit
Y’all muthafuckas really don’t know what this hip hop is all about
So while you keep on faking the funk, we gonna keep on walkin' through the darkness, carryin' our torches
Underground will live forever, baby

Guru: Peace Brother Elijah
Elijah Shabazz: Hey peace Guru, how you doing?
Guru: I'm maintaining, just been thinking though man
About the situation for today's youth man, the seeds man
What's your opinion on that?
Elijah Shabazz: Mmm that's strange I was thinkin the same thing
Something I read in the holy Qur'an how it says
""Has thou seen him who belies religion?
That is one who is rough, to the orphan.""
And no matter what we say our religion is
Whether it's Islam, Christianity, Juddaism, Buddha-ism, Old School-ism or New School-ism
If we're not schooling the youth WITH wisdom
Then the sins of the father will visit the children
And that's not keepin it real...
That's keeping it - *WRONG*

Now that we're getting somewhere, you know we got to give back
For the youth is the future no doubt that's right and exact
Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory... Robin Hood Theory

I seek Sun, deceive none, for each one must teach one
At least one must flow and show the structure, of freedom
It's me Dunn, cause petty things we don't need 'em
Let's focus to create somethin great, for all that sees them
They innocent, they know not what they face
While politicians save face genius minds lay to waste
If I wasn't kickin rhymes I'd be kickin down doors
Creatin social change and defendin the poor
The God's always been militant, and ready for war
We're gonna snatch up the ringleaders send em home in they drawers
But first where's the safe at? Let's make em show us
And tell em hurry up, give up the loot that they owe us
We bringin it back, around the way to our peeps
Cause times are way too deep, we know the Code of the Streets
Meet your defeat; this is my Robin Hood Theory... my Robin Hood Theory

And nowadays I pave the way for troops of my young brothers
Necessary by all means, sort of like Malcolm
Before it's too late; I create, the best outcome
So I take this opportunity, yes to ruin the
Devilish forces fucking up my black community
And we ain't doing no more interviews
Til we get paid out the frame, like motherfucking Donahue
We're taking over radio, and wack media
Cause systematically they getting greedier and greedier
Conquering turfs with my ill organization
Takin out the man while we scan the information
You wanna rhyme you best await son
You can't even come near, if you ain't got our share
You front on us this year, consider yourself blown out of here

Squeeze the juice out, of all the suckers with power
And pour some back out, so as to water the flowers
This world is ours, that's why the demons are leery
It's our inheritance; this is my Robin Hood Theory
God is Universal, he is the Ruler Universal
For those who can't follow that spells GURU when in my circle
I see all sides of my culture...
Design my thoughts like a sculpture
And chumps they wanna get with me cause I'm another entity
I'm sent to be, leadin the army of the century
Mention me, and snakes will retreat, eventually...

""Here's a bulletin from state police, Princeton Junction.""
""The militia...
Certain individuals of unidentified nature
Is now under complete control""
""Hip-hop is not, what it is today..""
""It's the real *echoes*... it's the (militia)""

If heads only knew how I felt about the rap game
They'd relocate, and change their fuckin' name
I eradicate move fakers, roll with coat shakers
Give dap to mad money makers
Shared cells with life takers, have sex with rump shakers
I make moves so I'mma earthquaker
I've been known to instill fear
Although the world may be round, we still trapped in the square
City light, got me buggin' and trife
Some die by the gun, some die by the knife
It's all right, like a game of spades I'm trump tight
Premier hit me with music to ensure that it thump right
And my flight, will be taken solely at night
'Cause that's when the freaks come out, no doubt
And in the dark hours is when I will shower
With the knowledge of my trade to get paid
Still I make moves like a snake in the grass, roundabout
I be dickin it down while you be assed out
Puff mad L's but never passed out
And if I'm caught up in a jam I blast my way out
There'll be no lettin' up, just straight shuttin' up
Or we'll start the wettin' up
Lyrical infrared sceptor never miss you

'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop

Yo; I ain't one to succumb to no man, but to command
And scoop up the troops when it's time to take a stand
Emphatically, deep strategies leave casualties
I creep gradually, 'til everybody knows
That I got more flows than Rosebud got hoes
The anger inside had me trapped
Til I got geared up with raps to tear you up like big gats
For big stacks, watch your back when I send em in
Caught you tremblin', my name and face you're rememberin'
Several attempts, but nah bitch, you'll never win
Rhymes pierce your skin or maybe limbs we'll be severin'
Take you to the mat, peep that, you should keep back
My ill-kid format will lay you flat like a doormat
That I walk on, I meditate while you talk on
And gossip, so I drop my hot shit; fully loaded Glock clips
So get the fuck out my block, kid
As nights turn to days, days go back to nights, we be speaking it right
And keeping it tight up in the street life
I meet life, head on, no holds barred
Born with a heart of gold, now mostly cold and scarred
En guard, choose your weapon, or get to steppin'
Lyrical bullets make you dance from the trance you be kept in
Assessments are made before, and during combat
I master my hunger, blow the spot when I bomb cats
One of us, equals many of us
Disrespect one of us, you'll see plenty of us
Conflict, is what I predict
You and your fellas is mad jealous, attempting to flare
We cleverly stalked ya, your fam'll miss ya
The war's on, that's why we formed The Militia
Everybody's spittin' it, the rhyme is hot
'Cause it's Big Shug, Guru, and Freddie the Foxxx
When Premier bring the beats, no it just don't stop
It's The Militia

You niggas owe me for my rhymes, I come to collect
For you dope fiend niggas in rap, I here to inject, check
My style is butter baby, spread it around
But when you niggas don't flow it right and fuck up my sound
I get down; in '89 I spit a ""buck"" in the face
Of every MC that came in the place, a scar you'll never erase
MC's are only recognized for their flows
I'm worldwide for the bitches, that I turned into hoes
You heard me spit it on Jew-elz, that's how it goes
For all them faking ass niggas and how I bust up their nose
And while your, nose is drippin', and drainin' blood
I'll be standing over you screamin', ""Nigga, WHAT, WHAT?! Nigga WHAT?!""
Niggas feel my presence, like I'm right in their palm
'Cause a stormy day is coming, when you see me so calm, it's on
No more twin Glocks, they jam up my plays
Now its twin .40 calibre Walther PPK's
I'm in the control of my game, you must respect me like The Ref
Uh-huh, you disrespect *gun clicks* you get the tech
I turn you fake niggas on and off, like I'm the clapper
I rob so many niggas, they should call me Jack the Rapper
I'll the illest nigga doing this, dead or alive
Gloria Gaynor on you motherfuckers, I Will Survive
You can try to come at me, but do you want the kick back?
You step inside the cage of a pit, and you get bit back, huh
My war is so tight, my drama so ill
Beef with me hangs around like a unpaid bill
I push these lyrics through any MC, and make it burn
So the niggas who be rhyming next, will miss a turn
When you speak of who's the dopest MC, I don't come up
But when you speak of who's the livest MC, I stay one up, what's up?
I got stripes like you got strikes and bogus mikes
Do what bitch niggas do best - bite
Y'all niggas can't make up a law that I don't overrule, overthrow
Preem' brought Bumpy this track so I'ma let you know
Before I slide I'mma leave you this jewel

Take this for example, young brothers want rep
'Cause in the life they're living, you can't half step
It starts with the young ones doing crimes for fun
And if you ain't down, you'll get played out, son
So let's get a car, you know, a fly whip
Get a dent puller, screwdriver and be off quick
With a dope ride, yeah, and a rowdy crew
We can bag us a Benz and an Audi, too
Even a jeep or a van, goddamn, we're getting ours, yo
Take a trip up the strip, and be like stars, so
It doesn't matter if the cops be scoping
They can't do jack, that's why a young brother's hopin'
To do anything, anywhere, anyplace
Buck wild in another court case
It's the code of the streets

They might say we're a menace to society
But at the same time I say ""Why is it me?""
Am I the target for destruction?
What about the system and total corruption?
I can't work at no fast-food joint
I got some talent, so don't you get my point?
I'll organize some brothers and get crazy loot
Selling D-R-U-G-S's and clocking dollars, troop
Cause the phat dough, yo, that suits me fine
I gotta have it so I can leave behind
The mad poverty, never having, always needing
If a sucker steps up, then I leave him bleeding
I gotta get mine, I can't take no shorts
And while I'm selling, here's a flash report
Organized crime, they get theirs on the down low
Here's the ticket, wanna bet on a horse show?

Shit, it's that O.G. flavor
Remind you of a corner bodega and that Olde E behavior
On play, but I ain't trying to scuffle with chumps
My long joints got the culture power plus the double pump
Troublesome to anyone who stands in the way
I'll stand and I'll spray, fuck if your man's in the way
Your girl want me ‘cause I do it better than you
The whole world wants me, nigga, I'm a legend to you
Like LL, Rakim, Ice-T and them niggas
Like Cube, Snoop and Dre, I'ma be seeing them figures
It don't matter, you don't have to be liking me, man
Keep playing, you'll be laying there, right where you stand

Gun on my waist, knife in my hand
I keep telling you cowards
I'ma leave you there, right where you stand
I don't want to talk and I ain't trying to fight with your man
Trying to get it over quick, leave you right where you stand
Some say I'm trifling; sometimes I rightfully am
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma leave you right where you stand

Chasin' beavers? Nah, I don't ever have to do that
P.I. till I die, and then I laugh at you cats
You happy perhaps ‘cause you got dough and bitches
But no love in the streets, only from 'mos and snitches
Only from the meat-lappin', suckers won't see it happen
Cross that line, then it's time for the heat-clappin'

Think just in case you shoulda took more precaution
A good time can become a nightmare so often
Like this nigga I know, that met these chicks on tour
They rocked him to sleep, robbed his ass for cash galore
Skated off in the night, without a trace or a hint
Scheamin tantalizin him, dressed up in lace and shit
Caught that kid out there, all high and dumbfounded
Made him think he was gettin some pussy
He just knew he was gonna pound it
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life

Baby won't you take the time (take the time)

Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)
Let me know what's on your mind (I'm waiting..)
Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Tycoon thug, he made a ten thousand dollar investment
Now he's not to be messed with, makes the girls get undressed quick
He's on some big muscled chest shit, posted by the exit
That's my man, he's the owner, yeah he be on some next shit
Said we'll make a few million by the next millenium
Told me to keep droppin jewels like a triggerman, puttin lead in him
Like Flavor said, I tell these hoes to, kill the noise
You know your Pops told you, watch them New York boys
All night, the ladies be like up in my mug
Tranquilin and trance dancin up in my drug
Fly honies, they hold me down like always
The same cat that used to get blunted down in the hallways
I love the cutie pies, never the doodie pies
I got discipline, I want the crew to rise
Situations like this'll make you think twice
Instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
Baby won't you take the time (uh-huh)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)

Slow down baby now let's make it right (on your love..)
(I like you..)

Ladies, here's somethin that we should be considerin
Things could get bitter when, you don't use discipline
Imaginin yourself livin lavish and plush
Hangin with the cat who be spendin cabbage and buyin stuff
However, don't be too clever with your endeavor
And don't let too many men, receive your treasure
Most cats, be thinkin with they bozack
I admit in the past I was tryin to break these hoes backs
Escape, without givin up a dime
You know them fly ladies had a good fuckin time
Coppin me some Timberland with a jacket to match it
Girls nowadays wanna pigeon for chickenscratch
And I ain't givin up nathan
Long as my game expands, it's my discipline to hate 'em
Situations like this, will make you think twice
That's why instead of preachin death in my songs, I breathe life
And just because I want to it don't mean I will
And just because I'm angry it don't mean I'd kill
And just because she looks good, it don't mean I'd hit it
And just because I'm horny, it don't mean I'm widdit
Just because I make records, don't mean that I'm gassed
And just because I'm rappin, don't mean I chase ass
And just because I'm whylin, don't mean I can't stop
I got discipline baby whether you do or not

Baby won't you take the time (the time)
Let me know what's on your mind (your mind)
Just because I'm yours don't make it right
(just because I'm yours)
Baby won't you take the time (bay-bee..)

""What, you wanna battle me?!""
""Yo, man, how much money you got?""

I used to guzzle 40's and own a beat up Caddy
Since the hood still love me, I'll turn the heat up, Daddy
I went from mackin' fly honeys on the train
To straight relaxin' on the beach, countin' money, gettin' brain
Soon as you rappers get a chance you wanna floss a lot
You buy a iced out watch because it cost a lot
Then you in the club, stylin' with dough
Profilin' with hoes that we boned a while ago
You rookies haven't done enough laps around the track
You had one hot single, but then your album sounds wack
Son, you bore me with your war stories
You ain't even do that shit, so that's just more stories
How you expect us to take you seriously?
The look in my eye, punk, has got you scared of me
I'm blastin' your sons, I'm snatchin' your funds
You catch a royal ass-whoopin', you've been askin' for one

While you alone in your room, shook to death of the streets
I'll take a second to speak, I keep my weapon in reach
I ain't talkin' romance, but you'll get swept off your feet
I keeps a ghetto chick that loves to blast and she peddle shit
Groupies fake moves, I get her to settle shit
You can't compare to the status right here
Legendary worldwide, we can battle right here
Listen, Junior, I'ma tear back your wig

Yo yo Gu-rizzi, yo
Yo whassup son?
Yo man, youknowhatImean? I need this money man
Get up out in these, in these streets man
Yo, so what's the deal God?
I'm sayin, what you need though?
Yo let me have like, two or three, three G's man
I'm sayin, I'm sayin son man
You know what happened last time though
I gotta do what I gotta do man, I gotta eat man
Whassup man? Oh your baby momma stressin you?

Way past the days of the deuce me and you stays a crew
Only a few percent knew what me and you went through
We've been sent to dominate, these corny come-lates
And set this crooked rap shit straight from Crenshaw to Castlegate
Like Pete and CL, I reminisce over days
From the streets of Boston to New York and all the ways
For certain niggas to blow up, and crime paid
But my praise goes to the most high
Cause some nights I got so wild yo, I almost died
Some stuff I got into, really scarred my mental
Pops wasn't tryin to hear it, cause of what he been through
Still, like my nigga Havoc said, sometimes you gotta
Hit your crew off, so they can make some bread
Cause no matter the weather, niggas be needin cheddar
And things in this world are more fucked up than ever
So let's make this bond to keep this hip-hop strong
You a man Baby Pop you know right from wrong
So stay out of trouble, and that goes for me too
That's what we need to do, that's my advice to you...

You remember what happened last time, when you got knocked
Doin your thing, sewin shit up on the block
You need to stop, fore you get caught again
Or you get shot and I lose another friend

""Think twice""

My advice to you, cut down on champagne and booze
For a nigga like me, most time that shit's bad news
It's like lightin a fuse whether it's sneakers or shoes
Cause somebody always wanna step up to start a feud
It's like Set-tin It Off but not the movie
Plus let's get some real women forget floozies and the groupies
Cause they spell mad problems from Watts to Harlem
And the bullshit won't stop long as the world's revolvin
And I recall when niggas knew my pops had clout
But they didn't know my sorry ass was gettin kicked out
And they was seein if I wanted to come bubble with them
And make my ends triple and double with them
And get in trouble with them, now memories of them
I wear em in my heart like a emblem
I doubt we'd ever be bigtime sellin dope coke or dust
It's killin us, let's take our people and make a exodus
Annhilation, inhalation through the lungs
Or extermination, by the use of dirty guns
Triple beam dreams and drug schemes of mad cream
Could be a sad scene when you go to that extreme
""Any man with the plan is precise with his life""
""Think twice""

You know I used to be a player, fly girl layer and a heartbreaker
Lovemaker, backbreaker but then I made a
Mistake yes I fell in love with this ill chick
Sweatin' me for money, my name and the dilsnick
My homeboys told me drop her 'cause it would be to my benefit
She used to say I'd better quit hanging with those derelicts
Romancing is my thing but I can't swing with no scheming hoes
Wherever my Beemer goes you know that I'm driving
Surviving in the '90s is a must so I trust
That everyone listen up as my vocals give thrust
I bust my rhymes first never chasing a skirt
Do much work while other suckas need more time to rehearse
Now back to the ex-girls, ex-lovers, ex-friends
It made me mad to find that she was only after my ends
She phones me and goes on about her new life now
I wish she knew right now
I think she's busted let's discuss it
When I was with her no trust, just fights
Just the he-say-she-say and the neighborhood highlights
Now I got my new girl or as I say my baby doll
But I'm still gettin' crazy calls, my ex-girl's got balls
Don't wanna play the field 'cause I get lovin' at home base
Don't gimme no long face just exit with grace
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, much respect, girl
But now you're my ex-girl 'cause I'm on with the next girl

She had much loot, liked to buy me fresh-dipped gear
Liked to have me near 'cause of my savoir faire
The time we shared was brief 'cause I needed relief
From her high-classed antics and all her conceit
Now she's crying wolf and I like don't wanna hear that
I told her the bear facts when things started out
She whines and she pouts about how I did her bad, yo
But she tried to buy me
Even tempt me with the hiney
I fell for a sec 'cause the clothes were real fly
I could almost feel I
Would give into her whims
Her thoughts were erratic, sporadic, crazy in nature
I told her hey look, yo, I can no longer date ya
Tried to pimp me with bank and fell short, your ship sank
Many thanks for the time and the watch and the link
You and I are the past, c'est la vie, nuff respect, girl
But now you're my ex-girl 'cause I'm straight with the next girl

You saw my moms in the supermarket and gave her your number
You asked her how's my sister then asked her how's my brother
Didn't ask about my father 'cause you know he ain't like ya
Every time I left for your crib he'd really get hyper
The advice he used to give me makes much sense now
I can't believe I used to let you break my confidence down
You used to ask me why the hell did I wanna live in Brooklyn?
You messed up my flow although you were good-lookin'
Yes darling was fly and this was the problem
'Cause back in the day she had me scheming and robbin'
To get her things to wear so when she went to the club
All eyes were on her and who, me? I just bugged
Caught in between feeling proud and feeling more like a sucker
Had to go undercover, get away, and find another
Been in Brooklyn nine years and been around the world, too
I've seen so many fly girls and I knew just what to do
I went from ex- to next took my time with each one
And you know they still love me so stop jellin' me, hon
I went home to see my moms and I saw you at the bus stop
Must I stop? Nah, I think not
You and I are the past c'est la vie, much respect, girl
But now you're my ex-girl and I'm out with the next girl
Out...

Right about now, N.W.A court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding
In the case of N.W.A versus the Police Department
Prosecuting attorneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube
And Eazy-motherfucking-E
Order, order, order!
Ice Cube, take the motherfucking stand
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
And nothing but the truth so help your black ass?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the fuck you gotta say?

Fuck the police comin' straight from the underground
A young nigga got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color, so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
Fuck that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk motherfucker with a badge and a gun
To be beating on and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
Fuckin' with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every nigga is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in a Benz-o
Beat a police out of shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they fags or what
Search a nigga down and grabbing his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showing out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any motherfucker in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT
Punk police are afraid of me, huh
A young nigga on the warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops dying in L.A. 
Yo, Dre, I got something to say

Pull your goddamn ass over right now!
Aw shit, now what the fuck you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it!
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the fuck up!
Man, fuck this shit
Alright, smart-ass, I'm taking your black ass to jail!
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this fucked up incident?

Fuck the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the motherfuckin' weapon is kept in
A stash spot for the so-called law
Wishing Ren was a nigga that they never saw
Lights start flashing behind me
But they're scared of a nigga, so they mace me to blind me
But that shit don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives them a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm saying, ""Fuck you, punk!""
Reading my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pulling out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-ass badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, and I'ma fuck you up
Make you think I'ma kick your ass
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as fuck when it comes to crime
But I'ma smoke 'em now and not next time
Smoke any motherfucker that sweats me
Or any asshole that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The motherfuckin' villain that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'ma turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound (*Gunshots*)
Yeah, somethin' like that
But it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck to say
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck—
Fuck the police

*Knocking*
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest (*Battering ram*)
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em! (Move, motherfucker, move now!)
What the fuck did I do, man? What did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your motherfucking ass on the floor! (You heard the man, shut the fuck up!)
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the fuck up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this bullshit?
I'm tired of the motherfuckin' jackin'
Sweating my gang, while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ass, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid ass nigga when I'm playing with the trigger
Of an Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put out my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangsta, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do you got?
A sucker in a uniform waiting to get shot
By me or another nigga
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smaller or bigger
(Size don't mean shit, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin' in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm driving off laughing, this is what I'll say
Fuck the police, fuck the— fuck the—
Fuck the police, fuck—
Fuck the police, fuck— fuck—
Fuck the police (The verdict)

The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck, white bread, chicken shit motherfucker
Wait, that's a lie! That's a goddamn lie!
Get him out of here! (I want justice!)
Get him the fuck out my face! (I want justice!)

You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge
Straight outta Compton!
Crazy motherfucker named Ice Cube
From the gang called Niggas Wit Attitudes
When I'm called off, I got a sawed-off
Squeeze the trigger, and bodies are hauled off
You too, boy, if you fuck with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off your ass, that's how I'm going out
For the punk motherfuckers that's showing out
Niggas start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix 'em and cook 'em in a pot, like gumbo
Going off on the motherfucker like that
With a gat that's pointed at your ass
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep y'all dancin'
With a crime record like Charles Manson
AK-47 is the tool
Don't make me act a motherfucking fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking niggas out the box, daily
Yo, weekly, monthly and yearly
Until them dumb motherfuckers see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't fuck with me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck
‘Cause Ice Cube is crazy as fuck
As I leave, believe I'm stompin'
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

Yo, Ren! (What's up?)
Tell 'em where you from!

Straight outta Compton, another crazy-ass nigga
More punks I smoke, yo, my rep gets bigger
I'm a bad motherfucker, and you know this
But the pussy-ass niggas won't show this
But I don't give a fuck, I'ma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking or craps
Just like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when I'm legally armed it's called packing
Shoot a motherfucker in a minute
I find a good piece of pussy and go up in it
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'ma call you a bitch or dirty-ass ho
You'll probably get mad like a bitch is supposed to
But that shows me, slut, you're not opposed to
A crazy motherfucker from the street
Attitude legit, ‘cause I'm tearing up shit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any dumb motherfucker that starts static
Not the right hand, 'cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull an AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren, but I'm raw
See, 'cause I'm the motherfucking villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killin'
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, your ass is through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a nigga like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)
(City of Compton, City of Compton)
Eazy is his name, and the boy is coming

Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous motherfucker raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See, I don't give a fuck, that's the problem
I see a motherfucking cop, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see a punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing a nigga driving
But don't know where the fuck he's going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they'll never seize me
Ruthless, never seen, like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see a spark and jump over hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and I'm jetting
But leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the bitch who got shot? Fuck her!
You think I give a damn about a bitch? I ain't a sucker
This is an autobiography of the E
And if you ever fuck with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the motherfucker, straight outta Compton
(Compton Compton Compton)

Suddenly, I see some niggas that I don't like
Walked over to 'em, and said ""What's up?""
The first nigga that I saw — hit him in the jaw
Ren started stompin' him, and so did E
By that time, got rushed by security
Out the door, but we don't quit
Ren said ""Let's start some shit!""
I got a shotgun, and here's the plot:
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
Boom! Boom! Boom! Yeah, I was gunnin'
And then you look, all you see is niggas runnin'
And fallin' and yellin' and pushin' and screamin' and cussin'
I stepped back and I kept bustin'
And then I realized it's time for me to go
So I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A is wanted for a homicide
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
Fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bellin'
Yo, what the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta! Gangsta! That's what they yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta! Gangsta!
He'll tell you exactly how he feel
And don't hold a fuckin' thing back

Homies all standin' around, just hangin'
Some dope-dealin', some gang-bangin'
We decide to roll and we deep
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
Real slow, and before you know
I had my shotgun pointed in the window
He got scared and hit the gas
Right then I knew I had to smoke his ass
He kept rollin', I jumped in the bucket
We couldn't catch him, so I said fuck it
Then we headed right back to the fort
Sweatin' all the bitches in the biker shorts
We didn't get no play from the ladies
With six niggas in a car — are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
To the hood, and we was fin to
Find somethin' else to get into
Like some pussy, or in fact
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put my foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bellin'
Yo! What the fuck are they yellin'?

Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit!
Man, what'cha gon' do now?
(What we're gonna do right here is go back)
How far you goin' back? (Way back)
""As we go a lil' somethin' like this"" — hit it!

Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Ice Cube and Eazy-E cold runnin' shit!

Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
Police tried to roll, so it's time to go
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the {diamond in the back, sun-roof top}
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E — I don't slang or bang
I just smoke muthafuckaz like it ain't no thang!
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
""We wanna fuck you, Eazy!"" I wanna fuck you too!
Because you see, I don’t really take no shit
So let me tell ya muthafuckaz who you fuckin' with

'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
If you fuck with me, I'll put a foot in your ass
I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bellin'
Yo! What the fuck are they yellin'?

Gangsta! Gangsta! That's what they yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta! Gangsta
He'll fuck up you and yours
And anything that gets in his way
Gangsta! Gangsta! That's what they yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta! Gangsta
He'll just call you a low-life muthafucka
And talk about yo' funky ways50Embed",https://images.genius.com/403a2a7e32f6c523df77a2a436502d0f.1000x1000x1.jpg

Yo, man, it's a lot of brothers out there flakin' and perpetratin'
But scared to kick reality
Man, you've been doin' all this dope producin'
You ain't had a chance to show 'em what time it is
So what you want me to do? (Express yourself)

I'm expressin' with my full capabilities
And now I'm livin' in correctional facilities
'Cause some don't agree with how I do this
I get straight, meditate like a Buddhist
I'm droppin' flavor, my behavior is hereditary
But my technique is very necessary
Blame it on Ice Cube, because he says it gets funky
When you got a subject and a predicate
Add it on a dope beat, and that'll make you think
Some suckas just tickle me pink to my stomach
'Cause they don't flow like this one
You know what?
I won't hesitate to diss one or two before I'm through
So don't try to sing this
Some drop science, well, I'm droppin' English
Even if Yella makes it a cappella
I still express, yo, I don't smoke weed or sess
'Cause it's known to give a brother brain damage
And brain damage on the mic don't manage nothin'
But makin' a sucka and you equal, don't be another sequel
You might also like
Express yourself (Ah, ah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah)
Express yourself (Smoke, smoke)
Come on and do it (Yeah, kick it over here)
Express yourself (Do it, do it, for the bag, for the bag)
Express yourself (Come on and do it)

Now, gettin' back to the PG
That's program, and it's easy
Dre is back, new jacks are made hollow
Expressin' ain't their subject because they like to follow
The words, the style, the trend, the records I spin
Again and again and again — yo, you on the other end
Watch a brother blend dope rhymes with no help
There's no fessin' and guessin' while I'm expressin' myself
It's crazy to see people be
What society wants 'em to be, but not me
Ruthless is the way to go, they know
Others say rhymes that fail to be original
Or they kill where the hip-hop starts
Forget about the ghetto and rap for the pop charts
Though some musicians cuss at home
But scared to use profanity when up on the microphone
Yeah, they want reality, but you won't hear none
They'd rather exaggerate a little fiction
Some say no to drugs and take a stand
But after the show, they go lookin' for the dopeman
Or they ban my group from the radio
Hear N.W.A and say ""Hell no!""
But you know, it ain't all about wealth
As long as you make a note to..
Express yourself (Yeah, yeah, brothers always beefin', fall victim to the streets)
Express yourself
Come on and do it (Yeah, yeah, do it)
Express yourself (Dr. Dre, Dr. Dre in full effect and N.W.A)
Express yourself
Come on and do it
Express yourself

From the heart 'cause if you wanna start to move up the chart
Then expression is a big part of it
You ain't efficient when you flow
You ain't swift, movin' like a tortoise, full of rigor mortis
There's a little bit more to show
I got rhymes in my mind, embedded like an embryo
Or a lesson, all of 'em expression
And if you start fessin', I got a Smith & Wesson for you
I might ignore your record because it has no bottom
I get loose in the summer, winter, spring and autumn
It's Dre on the mic, gettin' physical
Doin' the job, N.W.A is the lynch mob
Yes, I'm macabre but you know you need this
And the knowledge is growin', just like a fetus
Or a tumor, but here's the rumor
Dre is in the neighborhood, and he's up to no good
When I start expressin' myself — Yella, slam it!
'Cause If I stay funky like this, I'm doin' damage
Or I'mma be too hyped and need a straitjacket
I got knowledge and other suckas lack it
So when you see Dre, a DJ on the mic
Ask what it's like — it's like we gettin' hype tonight
'Cause if I strike, it ain't for your good health
But I won't strike if you just..

Yo man what you need?
Yo, uh, man I need something man, I need a twenty, man
Whatchu got, man?
Ey, I got this rope chain, man
Man, this shit look like a gold on the roll shit (What the fuck is that?)
(It's a fuckin dud!)
It's real man
This shit ain't real
(That nigga sellin' that shit again, man?!)
Get the fuck outta here and come back with some money
C'mon man, be cool man
Y'all Mexicans always comin' with this shit
Yo Dre, kick in the bass!

It was once said by a man who couldn't quit
""Dopeman, please can I have another hit?""
The dope man said, ""Clucka, I don't give a shit
If your girl kneel down and sucked my dick""
It all happened and the guy tried to choke her
Nigga didn't care, she ain't nothing but a smoker
That's the way it goes, that's the name of the game
Young brother getting over by slanging 'caine
Gold around his neck in 14 k heaven
Bitches jocking on his dick 24-7
Plus he's making money keeping the base heads waiting
Rollin' six four with the fresh ass daytons
Living in Compton, California CA
His uzi up yo ass if he don't get paid
Nigga begging for credit, he's knocking out teeth
Clocking much dollars on the 1st and 15th
Big wad of money, nothing less than a twenty
Yo, you want a five-oh? The dope man's got plenty
To be a dope man, boy, you must qualify
Don't get high off your own supply
From a key to a g it's all about money
10 piece for 10 base, pipe comes free
And people out there are not hip to the fact

Wait a minute -- who the fuck are you talking to?
Do you know who the fuck I am?
Man, I can't believe this shit -- this bitch is trying to gank me
I'll slap you up side your head with nine inches of limp dick!

You need a nigga with money so you get a dopeman
Juice that fool for as much as you can
She likes his car and he gets with her
Got a black eye cause the dopeman hit her
Let that slide and you pay it no mind
Find that he's slapping you all the time
But that's okay, cause he's so rich
And you ain't nothing but a dopeman's bitch!
Do what he say and you keep your mouth shut
Popping that trash might get you fucked up
You'll sit and cry if the dope man strikes you
He don't give a fuck - he got two just like you
There's a another girl in the dopeman's life
Not quite a bitch but far from a wife
Sh'es called the strawberry and everybody know
Strawberry, strawberry is the neighborhood ho
Do anything for a hit or two
Give tha bitch a rock, she'll fuck the whole damn crew
It might be your wife and it might make you sick
Come home and see her mouth on the dopeman's dick
Strawberry just look and you'll see her
But don't fuck around or she'll give you gonorrhea
And people out there are not hip to the fact

If you smoke 'caine, you're a stupid motherfucker
Known around the hood as the schoolyard clucker
Doing that crack with all the money you got
On your hands and knees searching for a piece of rock
Jonesing for a hit and you're looking for more
Done stole a Alpine of out Eazy's 6-4
You need your ass whooped cause it's out of this earth
Can't get a 10 piece need a dolla fifty's worth
Knucklehead nigga, yeah, you turned into a crook
But swear up and down, boy, that you ain't hooked
You beat your friend up and you whooped his ass long
Cause he hit the pipe till the rock was all gone
You're robbing and stealing, bugging and illing
While the dope man's dealing
What is killing your pain, cocaine, this shit's insane
Yo, E, she's a berry, let's run a train
Man, I wouldn't touch that bitch

Me neither; Ho, go home and wash out your beaver
And niggas out there messing up people's health
Yo, what the fuck yo gotta say for yourself?
Well, I'm the dopeman - yeah, boy, wear corduroy
Money up to here but unemployed
You keep smoking that rock and my pocket's getting bigger

Yo, got that five-0 - double up, nigga

Yeah, high rolling, big money I'm folding
Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holding
Strung strawberry jocking me so early
Ho, you want a hit you gotta get your knees dirty
Well, that's my life that how it's cut

Hey, dopeman!

Gotta make a run, it's a big money deal

And I done seen Snoop give away a Eddie Bauer
So fuck Jerry Heller and the white superpowers

Let's describe a certain female
A female with a disease of character and attitude
If you will, a snob
However in the view of NWA...

A bitch is a bitch
So if I'm poor or rich
I talk in the exact same pitch
Now the title bitch don't apply to all women
But all women have a little bitch in 'em
It's like a disease that plagues their character
Taking the women of America
And it starts with the letter B
It makes a girl like that think she better than me (bitch)
See, some get mad and some just bear it
But, yo, if the shoe fits wear it
It makes 'em go deaf in the ear that's why
When you say 'hi' she won't say 'hi'
Are you the kind that think you're too damn fly?
Bitch eat shit and die *laughs*
Ice Cube coming at you at a crazy pitch
(Why?) I think a bitch is a bitch

Who the fuck you think you calling a bitch you little sorry motherfucker
I don't know who the fuck you think you talking to
Let me tell you one motherfucking thing, I'm not no-
""Bitch, shut the fuck up""
You might also like
Yo, you can tell a girl that's out for the money (how?)
She look good and the bitch walk funny (he ain't lying)
She ain't no dummy, she's rather conniving
Yo bitch, fuck what I'm driving (yup)
See a young nigga that's striving (like me)
You're through without a BMW
That's why a bitch is a bitch I guess
Or either P-M-S
Here, test the girl that's kinda snobby (alright)
And I bet you dissing niggas is her hobby
And after she finished the test
Grade today of B-I-T-C-H
And watch her get mad 'cause she know it's true (she know it)
But a nigga like me'll say ""fuck you"" *laughs*
Do like Ice Cube, slam her ass in a ditch (word) (slam her ass)
'Cause a bitch is a bitch

""Why I gotta be a bitch?""
I ain't call you no bitch, if you listen to the goddamn song it'd tell you what a bitch is...
""Fuck the song 'cause I'm not no motherfucking bitch""
I didn't say you was a bitch, if you stop acting like a goddamn bitch
""Fuck you, little punk-ass little nigga""
Fuck you, bitch! You sloppy-ass, scandalous-ass ho!
""Fuck you! Who the fuck you think you are?""
Fuck you! Suck my dick, bitch! You scandalous-ass, doo-doo dog breath, stinking, ugly...
I once knew a bitch who got slapped
'Cause she played me like she was all that
A bitch can be your best friend talking behind your back (yeah?)
About who's fucking who and who's getting fat
Look at yourself for me (look, bitch)
Now do you fall in this category?
Or you the kind that won't blink
'Cause you don't think your shit stink *laughs*
Lucky I haven't had a drink
'Cause I'd down your ass
Then I'd clown your ass
'Cause the niggas I hang with ain't rich
We'll all say ""Fuck you bitch!"" (word)
Now what can I do with a ho like you
Bend your ass over and then I'm through (get the fuck out)
'Cause you see Ice Cube ain't taking no shit
(Why?) 'Cause I think a bitch is a bitch

There you have it, the description of a bitch
Now ask yourself are they talking about you?
Are you that funky, dirty, money-hungry, scandalous, stuck-up, hair piece contact wearing bitch?
Yep, you probably are

And this is only the single
Wait until the motherfucking album comes out
We gone have some more of that good shit
The shit you just can’t fuck with
But yo, we ain’t finished, tell 'em what’s up man
Yo man, there’s a gang of motherfuckers out there on the dick, man
In every motherfuckin' state
Wanna be like, wanna look like, wanna act like
Wanna dress like, wanna sound like motherfuckin' style stealin'
Clone ass N.W.A bitin' ass motherfuckin' everywhere man
Non-reality seein', non-reality feelin'
Non-reality livin' ass motherfuckers man
Hey, I don’t know, reality, it’s important to me, man
So fellas man, tell these niggas what it’s like in the minds of real niggas

Prisoner like a hostage
Yo, you should of covered your motherfucking head like an ostrich
Deep in the dirt 'cause you's a sucker
And your ass up high so I can kick the motherfucker
Don’t try to hang, you best avoid
'Cause my foot'll be so far up your ass you’ll get hemorrhoids
Before you try to fuck wit' Ren
I'll put two in your ass and you'll be shitting a size 10

First come, first serve, whoever's got the nerve
Step up and get what you deserve
From the word of a motherfucking hip-hop maniac
Brainiac, so what you oughta do is step the fuck back
Now how the fuck you think a rap will last?
Wit your ass saying shit that is said in the past
Yo, be original, your shit is sloppy
Get off the dick you motherfucking carbon copy

Falling deep in the drums so many of styles
Is one of the reasons a nigga ran a hundred miles
Cheating and now beating, the crowd I kept seating
But weak motherfuckers biting off and they kept eating
Styles that kept them full of bull
'Cause the vocals were local in nightclubs and not getting paid in full
They got the nerve to cuss
Only reason niggas pick up your record is 'cause they thought it was us

Yo, giving what I gotta give, doing what I gotta do
You don't care for me, so who gives a fuck about you?
You can't harm me, alarm me
'Cause we're the generals in this fucking hip-hop army
The niggas wit attitudes if you didn't know
We blow, flow and getting loose slow from the get go, yo
Titles are taken
Yo, fuck this shit, Yella, kick the break in
It's the real thing
You are now real, real niggas, niggas
You can run, but you can’t hide, you know I'ma find ya
'Cause a nigga like Ren's only two steps behind ya
Don’t look back because you're shaking and all scared
A nigga in black can be your scariest nightmare
So sleep wit the lights on, forget that the mic's on
Don't step on my motherfucking stage without Nike's on
Don’t say it’s psycho and then you just might go
Mentally fucked up when I let the right blow

All these niggas wit the jibber jabber
But couldn't kill a fly wit a motherfucking sledge hammer
Gangstas in black are out there
But only because, yo, it’s the shit that we wear
On my motherfucking dick
But I'ma love it when you drop like a motherfucking brick
So, yo, step off, go to bed, cause if you're mislead
You get a motherfucking bullet in your forehead
Black, the good, the bad, the ugly, you see
A little streetwise nigga, you know me
Rolling wit' some real niggas playing for keeps
But you motherfuckas know who run the streets
Wit that hardcore hip-hop rap shit
Now how much harder can another nigga get?
Trying to be like us, sound like us, dress like us
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust
So nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, please
Since you're on the dick why don't you drop to your knees
'Cause I'm a motherfucker that's out to kill
Eazy-E, a nigga that's real
Real niggas, straight off the streets of Compton
Quick to get in your shit without second thought
And if your ass get smoked, it's my bullet you caught
So if you're talking shit about the niggas in black
Bow down to the Kings in Raider hats

They played out, that's what niggas were chanting
One nigga left and they said we ain't having it
People had thought we was finished and then done wit'
But if you think about it, yo, we really ain't done shit
Yet, so cover your ears and wipe your tears
And quit sniffing all over my dick for new ideas
And when the new record comes, I’ll come like a fucking bomb
Asking for fucking money, don't buy you a fucking crumb
You're on the dicks of four niggas not one
And when it comes to dicks, you don't even have one
So brace yourself to make sure you don't get fucked up
'Cause if I let you slide, it’s just 'cause you lucked up
Don’t come in my face again, because I'ma floor ya
And if you're a bitch, I'm a fucking ignore ya
Because my attitude's a little bigger
'Cause MC Ren is one of the real niggas

Lost in a motherfucking world of madness
Sadness, but Dre is just a nigga that glad there's
Sucka motherfuckers like you, making wack jams
Because it only shows you how dope I am
Never try to ignore us
When I'm expressing, stand still like you're full of rigor mortis
'Cause I'm a real nigga, but I guess you'll figure
You can break me, take me, but watch me pull the trigger
Dre is just a nigga with heart, a nigga that's smart
A nigga that’s paid to say what others are scared to play
We started out wit too much cargo
So I'm glad we got rid of Benedict Arnold
Yo, N.W.A, criticized for what we say
But I'ma do the shit anyway
'Cause I'm the motherfucking doctor, never faking
Yo, Yella, kick the motherfucking break in

It's the real thing
You are now real, real niggas, niggas
Yeah, motherfuckers, the real thing
You are now real, real niggas, niggas

N.W.A, straight outta motherfucking Compton
Taking over shit in all of the 1990s

I got a taste for waste and a taste and a blood
Murder I heard her when she screamed the ""Drop!""
'Cause her son caught the slug
Relate this to no choice
And listen to this straight-up man before they ban the voice
While I rhyme to the rhythm of a pop
Remember the first nigga to run is the first to get shot
Whoever said that what I say and portray is negativity
Need to come kick it in the city with me
And find the black and crack the fact
And take that shit back
Cause they don't wanna fuck with that
There's too many niggas they're trying to calm
If motherfuckers could get it, nobody would've fucked with it
Appetite for Destruction
For him to get a bit more shit he gotta commit
Murder in the first degree and manslaughter
Taking the life of his wife and young daughter
A whole city of bitches that look sucked up
And the niggas is killing, it's straight fucked up
Whoever saying what I'm saying's for greed
Then I ain't even what they're trying to feed
My appetite for destruction

""You guys know who I'm talking to""

The appetite is tremendous, so I'm gonna spin this
Drop up some violence because they asked me to end this
Some trouble that I caught cause I was noisy
A nigga tried to take advantage because of the kamikaze
He took a swing for my head, thought I was faded
Started running for the door but the fucker never made it
The sound of the nine went ""Bang!""
And all over the wall was his motherfucking brain
Cause I'm a nigga you can't sleep on
So set the alarm cause I hit like a motherfucking bomb
I do damage with the nine in my hand
But the average nigga that don’t know me don’t understand
I'm from the streets, so therefore
You know I don't care for a sucker that ain't down
With the real niggas, the niggas, the niggas
Yo, and that's the way shit gotta go ain't even sober
Any time that the nine wanna leave
I got a .38 hidden up the sleeve
And it's ready to go to war 'cause that's what it's here for
I shoot down a million niggas and shoot one more
And that's the million and one, they couldn't hang with the appetite, 'cause they wasn't rapping right
So I had to destroy whoever was standing in my presence
For fucking up the essence
Appetite for Destruction
""Cops put a hurting on your ass, man
You know, they really degrade you
White folks don't believe that shit
They don't believe that cops degrade you
 Oh come on, those beatings, those people were resisting arrest.""

Check it out, y'all, in the house, y'all
So I can show and flow and let the people know
So won't you ease on down to the yellow brick road to Compton
But first let me tell you something
I possess the Ten Commandments of the hip-hop thugsta
Known as the thief and murderer
First One: Honor thy nigga with an attitude
Gotta get respect or break your motherfucking neck
Second One: Always gotta fuck out of wedlock
I like it when the pussy go snap, crackle and pop
Number Three: I'm a gangsta fanatic
I smoke any fools tryna 'cause some static
Number Four: Here's what's in store
A crazy-ass nigga that remains hardcore
Fifth One: My killing has begun
I pull out my gun, that'll keep me on the run
Step Six: Hmmm, it's kinda tricky
Can't forget that I'm motherfucking chicken-shit
To the ones who tries to play the E
By the time you get to seven, you'll be six feet deep
Number Eight: Make no mistake
Move real sneaky and you're bound to catch your prey
Ninth One: I gotta be raw
Fuck any brainwashing man-made law
Last but not least, I must be real

Catch those motherfuckers, catch them, catch them
Hey man, keep up keep up, this way, come on man, hurry up
You don't really think you're gonna get away, do you?
We haven't spotted them yet. But they're somewhere in the immediate vicinity

A 100 miles and runnin' -  MC Ren, I hold the gun and
You want me to kill a mutherfucker and it's done in
Since I'm stereotyped to kill and destruct -
Is one of the main reasons I don't give a fuck
Chances are usually not good
'Cause I'm frisked with my hands on a hot hood
And gettin' jacked by the you-know-who
When in a black and white the capacity is two
We're not alone, we're three more brothers, I mean street-brothers
Not wearing medallions, 'cause we're not stupid, mutherfuckers
They're out to take our heads for what we said in the past
Point blank, they can kiss my black ass
I didn't stutter when I said ""Fuck Tha Police""
'Cause it's hard for a nigga to get peace
Now it's broken and can't be fixed
'Cause police and little black niggas don't mix so
Now I'm creepin' through the fall
Runnin' like a G, we'll see, I might have slayed y'all
So for now pack the gun and
Hold it in the air 'cause MC Ren has a 100 miles of runnin'
You might also like
In today's news. Four fugitives are on the run
FBI sources tell us that the four are headed
100 miles to their home base, Compton

Lend me a mutherfuckin' ear
So I can tell you why
Runnin' with my brothers, headed for the homebase
With a steady pace on the face that just reads race
The road ahead goes on and on
The shit is gettin' longer than the mutherfuckin' marathon
Runnin' on but never runnin' out
Stayin' wired and if I get tired, I can still try out
Hitchhikin' if that's what it gotta do
But nobody's pickin' up a Nigga Witta Attitude
Confused, yo but Dre's a nigga with nuthin' to lose
One of the few who's been accused and abused
Of the crime of poisonin' young minds
But you don't know shit til you been in my shoes
And Dre is back from the C-P-T
Droppin' some shit that's D-O-P-E
So fuck the P-O-L-I-C-E!
And any mutherfucker that disagrees
Stuck and runnin' hard, hauling ass
'Cause I been a nigga known for havin' a notorious past
My mind was slick - my temper was too quick
Now the FBI's all over my dick
Got the stick and runnin' just to find the gun that started the clock
That's when the E jumped off the startin' block
A 100 miles from home and, yo, it's a long stretch
A little sprintin' mutherfucker that they won't catch
Yeah, back to Compton again
Yo, it's either that or the Federal pen
'Cause niggas been runnin' since beginning of time
Takin' a minute to tell you what's on my mutherfuckin' mind
Runnin' like I just don't care
Compton's 50 miles but, yo, I'mma get there
Archin' my back and on a straight route
Just like Carl Lewis I'm ballin' the fuck out
From city to city I'm a menace as I pass by
Rippin' up shit just so you can remember I'm
A straight up nigga that's done in, gunnin' and comin'
Straight at yo ass, a 100 miles and runnin'

This one goes out to the four brothers from Compton
You're almost there, but the FBI has a little message for you:
Nowhere to run to, baby. Nowhere to hide
Good luck brothers

Runnin' like a nigga I hate to lose
Show me on the news but I hate to be abused
I know it was a set-up - So now I'm gonna get up
Even if the FBI wants me to shut up
But I've got 10 000 niggas strong
They got everybody singin' my ""Fuck Tha Police"" song
And while they treat my group like dirt
Their whole fuckin' family is wearin' our T-shirts
So I'mma run 'til I can't run no more
'Cause it's time for MC Ren to settle the score
I got a urge to kick down doors
At my grave like a slave even if the Ren calls
Clouds are dark and brothers are hidin'
Dick-tricklin' at the sunny mutherfucker's are ridin'
Started with five and, yo, one couldn't take it
So now there's four 'cause the fifth couldn't make it
The number's even - now I'm leavin'
We're never gettin' took by a bitch with a weave in
Her and the troops are right behind me
But they're so fuckin' stupid, they'll never find me

One more mile to go through the dark streets
Runnin' like a mutherfucker on my own two feet
But you know I never stumble or lag last
I'm almost home so I better haul ass
Tearin' up everything in sight
It's a little crazy mutherfucker dodging the searchlight
Now that chase, the shit, is done and
Four mutherfuckers goin' crazy with
A 100 miles of runnin'!
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Surprise, niggas!10Embed",https://images.genius.com/403a2a7e32f6c523df77a2a436502d0f.1000x1000x1.jpg

Ninteen-ninety-mothafucking-one
N.W.A back in this mothafucker, yo
Takin' out all you commercialized-ass niggas
And we're on this laid back track
And we're doin' this one kinda smooth
So whatcha gonna do, Dre? - Kick it!

And so on, let the shit flow on
Because I need somethin' to go off on
The mothafuckin' D-R-E servin' a death wish
So I'mma hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the B-en-z
I got 44 ways of gettin' paid
Sittin' in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To scoop up Ren, I heard shots
1, 2, 3, then I seen a nigga
Hoppin' the fence and it was Ren on the mothafuckin' trigger
He got in the Benz and said
""Dre, I was speakin' to yo' bitch O'Shea”
And as we roll on, I seen the patroller creep
So we got ghost before they peeped
Me and Ren in a black CE, yo
Bumpin' some funky shit by the D.O.C
I gotta get paid, paid in a hurry, see
I got a have it if I'm not paid thoroughly
I start takin', makin' sure my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'

Ba-ba-ba-ba! Fuck the mothafuckin' police cause they push that black man down and they kick him in his mothafuckin' balls. Goddamn police, fuck them! Come down, MC Ren

I heard a dope beat, somebody told me that Buck did it
But if Dre didn't do it I can't fuck with it
N.W.A is like a mix a fix a trix
Real niggas with big dicks
You're takin' a chance when you think that
Talkin' under your breath won't lead to young death
Fuckin' up shit, ain’t shit but a killin'
For a nigga labeled as bein' a mothafuckin' villain
But you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
How so many prayed I'd be a mothafuckin' failure
Real niggas gotta have top rankin'
I hooked up with three more niggas and started makin'
Funky-ass shit for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a
Sample of a ruthless organization
But you don't want a confrontation
Real niggas don't play
Yella, Eazy, me, and the nigga nigga Dre
Yo, always makin' sure that my shit is steady bumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'

Boom-boom! Look at that bitch walking down the mothafuckin' street
Now she know the Admiral wanna hold my dick in
Because that bitch’s booty is so na-na-na-na-na-na-nasty
Yeah, the world's most dangerous group
Definitely in this mothafucka
Sendin' a shout-out to all the bitches out there
Yo, you can get the pick up to suck a dick up 'til you hiccup
You know what I'm sayin'

Yo, cause I'm a nigga for life
And I really don't give a fuck
I'm goin' for mine, every time
I see a fuckin' softy, punk strong as coffee
A nigga like that best to back up off me
Yo, cause these are the days and the times of the real niggas
False niggas, end up as tossed niggas
And that's on the real, cause I'm a nigga that kills
Again and again, so tell 'em what's up Ren

If I'm not into nothin', I don't feel right
So I grab the nine and the clip and go and murder mothafuckas at night
Because I'm startin' to fiend, from sittin' in a cell
Where the crime was too tragic I couldn't make bail
So now they gotta hold me
And listen to rehabilitation over and over, sayin' they told me
But I don't give a fuck cuz I know my shit is pumpin'
A nigga always into somethin'
1991 and N.W.A get the job done
Admiral Dancehall gonna sing this little tale 'bout a girl that's quick fi lick me dick, it goes something like this....

Lesson two
Gently place the balls into the mouth and hum
Get it all, baby
Get it all, baby
Get it all, baby
What you want me to do with it? (Don't matter just don't bite it)
She swallowed it (Suck this dick for daddy)
She swallowed it (Juicin' at the lips)
She swallowed it (It's the world's biggest dick)
What do you want me to do with it? (Don't matter just don't bite it), yeah

Slow is the tempo
Now talkin' but a nympho, so peep it out, here goes the info
This is a bitch that did the whole crew
She did it so much we make bets on who the ho would love to go through
And for the shit that she does, give her a drumroll
Because the dumb bitch licks out the asshole
And she'll let you videotape her
And if you got a gang of niggas, the bitch'll let you rape her
She likes suckin' on dicks and lickin' up nut
And'll even take the broomstick up the butt
Just to say that she did it with a rapper
But the pussy was more fishy than red snapper
""But how many licks would it take,"" she'd ask
""To make MC Ren start gushin' up vanilla shake?""
She took her tongue out her mouth, put it on top
Like a cherry, started movin' it like a snake and it was very irresistible
I couldn't pay the bitch to quit
'Cause the ho was doin' some ol' crazy shit
That made me start havin' a fit
'Cause the bitch sucked a hellafied dick (Suck this dick)

She swallowed it (Yeah), get it all, baby

Now one night I was at a drive-in
And a car full of niggas straight drove in
I thought they was comin' to start trouble, but no
Five niggas in a bucket with the neighborhood ho
Now what do you expect? They're gonna dog her like a doggy
Thirty minutes later and the windows all were foggy
And I'm off in my car havin' a fit 'cause the bitch that I'm with
Said no fuckin' on the first date shit
And I'm like damn, I wish I was in the bucket
To be the sixth nigga with the ho and I can fuck it
So I told the bitch I was with that I'm goin' to the snack bar
And got the fuck out the car
Went to the bucket and I looked through the window
It was some niggas that I knew, they let me in, yo
And my turn was like next
I couldn't see her face, all I saw was her pussy and her chest
I wanted to see the face, I felt I oughta
Peep over the seat, oh shit, it's the preacher's daughter
And she's only fourteen and a ho
But the bitch sucks dick like a specialized pro
She looked at me, I was surprised
But wasn't passin' up the chance of my dick gettin' baptized
I told the bitch to do it quick
You little ho, hurry up and suck my dick
It's the world's biggest dick (Don't matter just don't bite it)
It's the world's biggest dick (Don't matter just don't bite it)
What do you want me to do with it? (Don't matter just don't bite it)
She swallowed it (Yeah), get it all, baby

Now I'ma break it down with a fact
Since the last ""Just Don't Bite It"" girls don't know how to act
Sayin' that they never would suck a dick
But when they've tried it they couldn't quit
'Cause ninety percent of the bitches today, they love that shit
And those are the main ones that say they don't do it
But MC Ren knows the bitches are used to it
So fellas, next time they try to tell a lie
That they never sucked a dick, punch the bitch in the eye
And then the ho will fall to the ground, then you'll open up her mouth
Put your dick in and move the shit around
And she'll catch on and start doin' it on her own
Actin' like she's tryin' to suck the meat off a chicken bone
And then she won't let go
Because bitches suck nut out of a dick just like Drano
Get the last drop, unclogging the pipe
Then the stupid bitch is out doing the same shit the next night
Because she just can't quit
'Cause she's addicted, addicted
She's addicted, addicted
She's addicted to suck a good dick
It's the world's biggest dick (Don't matter just don't bite it)
It's the world's biggest dick (Don't matter just don't bite it)
What do you want me to do with it? (Don't matter just don't bite it)

Ain't that kinda shit you can sweep under no rug, you know?

Ren is the villain and you're just an hostage
So whenever I'm steppin' cover your head like an ostrich
Groupies been waitin' for this, suckers been hatin for this
You know why? Because so many are relatin' to this
Jealous is how they feel it intentionally
But they start to love it because I made it eventually
Pumpin' the music I keep the music like pumpin'
Cause Ren ain't in here for nothin', I keep the average crowd jumpin'
Yo, you know the color, the villain's in black
Always down to make noise, and attack
So you better get back unless you wanna come with it
And make your face like a target and close your eyes when I hit it
You're screamin' with fear but it's with fear that you're screamin'
You're wakin up in a sweat cause Ren is givin' bad dreams and
I'm not schemin', I'm just tellin the facts
That's how it is when N.W.A. starts to jack
So brothers that wanna scrap with me
That sweezin' and sneezin' will have to lap with me
Especially beggin' to write some lyrics with me
I just snatch your girl to take a nap with me
Cause when it comes to Ren there's no comparison
And if you try to be me, it's quite embarrassin'
But I understand cause you're mentally slow
Cause I can tell from the jump you're too nervous to go

I can tell that you're afraid to fight me
Simple because you lost the crowd and they had to invite me
Because your sweat is a puddle but there's a puddle o' sweat
I'm a threat, so get a cold rag and wipe your neck
And clean the dirt off your face that causes acne
It's ridiculous thinkin' that you can jack me
This is the round where the punch will go
Into your H-E-A-D; that's known as a blow
I'm makin a point but it's a point that I'm makin
Like, see, I'm hatin' the fakin' I keep the suckers like shakin'
Scared to speak with a thought when they're chosen
The sound of my voice in their ear and they're frozen
This is a battle to the death, it's like the same ol'
Against a brother on a tip, with a Kangol
Givin' a pain but it's with pain that I'm givin
But I'm comparin' and tearin' em but I'm makin a livin'
With the hype of a nine volt battery
And the odds for me to conquer is averagely good
Meanin' I'mma flow
I'm from the streets so, yo, I'm ready to go
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)
The gangsta's black and he's about to attack
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me
Man whatcha gonna do now? - *Get funky*

The 'do not disturb' sign is in effect
While I'm thinkin of a fool to select
To give the victim the verdict so for the verdict a victim
Slammin' my vocals on a dance with the rest then I kick them
Tell 'em they're guilty, and peep out the bailer
And get a new track o' drums so I can play with
Percussion, pumpin' it loud when I perform
Yo, you wanna play in my game, put on a uniform
It ain't a rule in the book you have to go by
Hey, cause when it comes to cheatin', yo, you should know I
For fear in the hearts cause it's the hearts full of fear
Coz what you hear in your ear is something funky and clear
The Hulk was incredible yo but Ren he was super
But now I'm ruthless, a civilian and not a trooper
But a soldier with a top rankin
Givin' dope material, the hell with the gankin'
So play like an airplane and just jet
And keep your blood pressure low cause I'm a threat, cause if not
I'm afraid of the show
That you're a sucker and you're too nervous to go
If it ain't ruff, it ain't me (Yo Ren)

Ice Cube, do you think you could give me some money to get my hair done?
What's wrong with your hair right now?
Well you know I get it done every week, and I need my nails done too
Look, I'mma tell you like this

I ain't the one, the one to get played like a pooh butt
See I'm from the street, so I know what's up
On these silly games that's played by the women
I'm only happy when I'm goin up in 'em
But you know, I'm a menace to society
But girls in biker shorts are so fly to me
So I step to 'em, with aggression
Listen to the kid, and learn a lesson today
See, they think we narrow minded
'Cause they got a cute face, and big-behinded
So I walk over and say ""How ya doin'?""
See, I'm only down for screwin', but you know
Ya gotta play it off cool
'Cause if they catch you slipping, you'll get schooled
And they'll get you for your money, son
Next thing you know you're getting their hair and they nails done
Fool, and they'll let you show 'em off
But when it comes to sex, they got a bad cough
Or a headache, it's all give and no take
Run out of money, and watch your heart break
They'll drop you like a bad habit
'Cause a brother with money yo, they gotta have it
Messing with me though, they gets none
You can't juice Ice Cube, girl, 'cause I ain't the one

Girrrrrl, you got to get these brothers for all the money you can honey. 'Cause if they ain't got no money, they can't do nothin' for me but get out of my face
I know what you mean, girl; it ain't nothin' right jumpin' off unless he got dollars!

Sometimes I used to wonder
How the hell an ugly dude get a fine girl's number
He's getting juiced for his ducats
I tell a girl in a minute yo, I drive a bucket
And won't think nuttin' of it
She can ride or walk, either leave it or love it
I show her that I'm not the O, the N-E, say
I'm a ruthless N-I double-G A
'Cause I'm gamin' on a female that's gamin' on me
You know I spell girl with a B
A brother like me is only out for one thing
I think with my ding-a-ling, but I won't bring no
Flowers to your doorstep, when we goin' out
'Cause you'll take it for granted, no doubt
And after the date, I'mma want to do the wild thing
You want lobster? Huh! I'm thinking Burger King
And when I take you, you get frustrated
You can't juice Ice Cube and you hate it
But you see, I don't go nuts
Over girls like you with the BIG ol butts
It start comin' out the pocket, to knock it
But when the damage is done
You can only lay me girl, you can't play me girl
For the simple fact that, I ain't the one
I don't care how they look; if they got money, we can hook up but they ain't gettin' none
Yeah, I just make em think they gonna get some, play with they mind a lil bit, and get that money. Oh Ice Cube, can I have some money pleeeease?

Give you money? Why bother?
'Cause you know I'm looking nothing like your father
Girl, I can't be played or ganked
Ganked means getting took for your bank
Or your gold or your money or something
Nine times outta ten, she's giving up nothing
They get mad when I put it in perspective
But let's see if my knowledge is effective
To the brothas man they robbing you blind
'Cause they fine with a big behind, but pay it no mind
Keep your money to yourself, homie
And if you got enough game
You'll get her name and her number
Without going under
You can't leave 'em and love and stay above 'em
I used to get no play; now she stay behind me
'Cause I said I had a Benz 190
But I lied and played the one
Just to get some; now she feels dumb
To my homies it's funny
But that's what you get trying to play me for my money
Now don't you feel used?
But I don't give a hoot, huh, because I knock boots
You shouldn't be, so damn material
And try to milk Ice Cube like cereal
Now how many times do I have to say it?
'Cause if I have to go get a gun
You girls will learn I don't burn
You think I'm a sucka, but I ain't the one
But you said you love me!
I don't see no rings on this finger
Why you doin' me like this? I love you!
Yeah, you love my money; I got what I wanted -- beat it!13Embed",https://images.genius.com/403a2a7e32f6c523df77a2a436502d0f.1000x1000x1.jpg

(Kick that shit)
(Cold kicking ass)
Cold kicking ass
Cold kicking ass
(Funky fresh Eazy-E)
(Pull up a chair and I'ma tear shit up)

I don't drink brass monkey, like the beat funky
Nickname Eazy-E, yo' 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kicking to show my shit
Rapper holdin' my dick, boy, I don't quit
And if ain't rap, then you know it's crap
Crowd rocking sucka stomper from around the way
I got a six-shooter, yo, mean hombre
E rolling out, to find the Boyz
To kick dust and cuss, crank up some noise
Police on my tail, I don't like jail
40 ounce in my lap and and it's freezin' my balls
Hook a right turn and let the boys go past
Then I say to myself, they can kiss my ass
Hip to get drunk got the eight in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's Greatest Hits
Turn the shit up had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the Eastside, South of Compton
See a big ass, and I say word
I took a look at her face, and the bitch was to the curb
But she was on my tip for the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's getting busy got the 8-ball rolling
You might also like
I, was...cold kicking ass
I, was...raised in L.A
I, was...cruising down the street in my six-four
Too much posse

Riding on Slausson, looking for Crenshaw
Turned down the sounds, to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and  had a fit
Cause a Mexican almost wrecked my shit
Flipped his ass off put it to the floor
Bottle was empty so I went to the store
Nigga on tip cause I was drunk
See a sissy ass punk, had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Fired at the punk and it was all because
I had to show the nigga what time it was
Pulled out the jammy and like a mirage
A sissy like that got out of Dodge
Sucka on me cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 Ball rolling
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Fuck it up, y'all
Yeah
Olde English 800, because that's my brand
Take it in a bottle, forty, quart or can
Drink it like a madman, yes I do
Fuck the police and a 502
Stepped in the party, I was drunk as hell
Three bitches already said, ""Eric yo' breath smells!""
40 ounce in hand that's what I got
Yo man you see Eazy hurling in the parking lot
Stepped on your foot cold dissed your ho
Asked her to dance and she said, ""Hell no""
Called her a bitch because that's the rule ""Bitch?! Who you callin' a bitch?!
Boyz-n-the hood trying to keep me cool
Tell my homeboy you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get em up
I started dropping the dogs, and watch you fold
Just dumb full of cum got knocked out cold
""Make you look sick you snotty-nosed prick!
Now your fly bitches all over his dick!""
Punk got dropped cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's fucked up and got the 8 ball rolling

Yo, pass the brew Ren while I tear shit up
And y'all listen up close to roll call
Eazy-E's in the place I got money and juice
Ron-De-Vu's with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so funk funk funky
Do the Olde 8, forget the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes, that I say
Hail to the niggas from C.I.A
Krazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams, so fuck respect
Make a toast all you punk to the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's breaking out and got the 8-ball rolling
Man I'm outta here
Yo Eazy, you forgot to tell em what city you chill in

A-yo, Dre, what's goin' on, man? What's goin' on?
Ay, what ch'all gonna do for this last record?
Nah, tell me what cha'all gonna do?
Okay, you want me to do the intro? Aight!

Parental discretion is advised for the moment
While I'm gettin' candid, now understand it
Ain't too typical in any way
Though the pro on the mic is the D-O-to-the-C — this is an intro
I know The D.O.C. makes you wanna take a Valium
So buy a bucket 'cause upcomin' is my album
And for the record, meanin' my record, check it!
Listen to the single and you'll be like, ""Yo, I gotta get it!""
But in the meantime, listen to the rhyme
Of the Dr. Dre played with N.W.A
Yella's on the drum roll, rockin' the beat
A-yo, Dre! Where you gonna take this shit, man?

A-yo, let's take it to the street (Word up)
Let 'em understand perfection
Let knowledge be the tool for suckas to stop guessin'
'Cause I don't give a fuck about radio play
Observe the English I display
Lyrics for the adults, children have been barred
And scarred from listenin' to somethin' so muthafuckin' hard
Dope! Pumpin' that's so my shit will never falter
Yo, it's Dre! So fuck the ""Mind of Minolta""!
Psycho like no other muthafucka
So step to me wrong — G-O for what you N-O!
But be warned — never will I leave like a regular
'Cause I'm a little better than the regular competitor
I used to see 'em on stage
Earnin' money like a thief, but without a gauge
Until I got full of clockin' the lame, gettin' pull
(They said you wasn't gon' get paid) Nah, that's bullshit!
They like it stylistic, and I enchant the crowd like I'm a mystic
(C-C-C-C) C-C-C-cameras are flashin' when I'm in action
A photo, or fresh with the flair for fashion
Pure simplicity — see, it's elementary
You hear one of the hardest muthafuckaz this century
Try to comprise a word to the wise and they guys
Parental discretion is advised
You might also like
Ren is most extremely high-performance
The black hat 'cause I worn this, 'cause it's like enormous
Some shit I don't take it, not even in a toilet
And shit from a sucka's put in a pot and I'll boil it
Turn up the pilot as it burns
And maybe, the muthafuckaz will learn
I'm not a sub, 'cause I speak sensible
Not considered a prince, 'cause I'm a principal
I'm engineerin' the shit that you're hearin'
'Cause when it comes to power, I'm power-steerin'
Silly, you say? I say you're silly when you say it
Rushin' to the eject to put my shit in and play it
It's like Apollo, but I'm not an amateur
And I'm not givin' a fuck while I'm damagin' ya
It's for the record — so Ren's lyrics is gonna spin it
And if there was a trophy involved, I'd win it
Possession is mine and I'm the holder
'Cause a nigga like Ren don't give a fuck 'cause I'm older
So for you to step off would be wise
And say fuck it! Parental discretion is advised

I be what is known as a bandit
You gotta hand it to me when you truly understand it
'Cause if you fail to see — read it in Braille, it'll still be funky
So what's next is the flex of a genius
My rapid-stutter-steppin' if you seen this
Dope, you hope that I don't really mean this
But if Play made a greater high-top fade
It's not my trademark when I get loose in the dark
You guessed it was a test of a different style
It's just another muthafucka on the pile
Drivin' your ass with the flow of the tongue
You hung yourself shortly after knowledge was brung to your attention
By the hardest muthafuckin' artist that is known for lynchin'
Any sucka in a minute — stagger 'em all!
When I start flowin' like Niagara Falls
Ice Cube is equipped to rip shit in a battle
Move like a snake when I'm mad, and then my tail rattle
I get low on the flow, so let your kids know
When I bust, parental discretion is a must!
Little did they know that I would be arrivin'
And it's surprisin', rockin' it from where I been
But it's the E here to take, no mistakes will be made
In the trade where funky ass records are bein' played
Fuck the regular! Yo, as I get better, the
Bitches wanna trick and go stupid up on the dick
So I get 'em hot, thinkin' they gonna get it
As they sit, rubbin' their legs like a cricket
To you it may be funny, but
There's no service of beef without money
So slip the C-note, and you can choke
On a wing-ding-ding-a-ling down your throat
Foreplay to me ain't shit!
When you spread 'em, I'm ready, then you can get the dick
Of the E'z, if you can deal with the size
But if you can't, parental discretion's advised!

Why you brothers insist on usin' the word nigga?
Don't you know that's bringin' down the black race?
Nigga nigga nigga that's all I hear you motherfuckers talk about is nigga
You can do what you want, just keep it out of my neighborhood
Personally I think the lyrics are a bit too harsh
I ain't no nigga, fuck that shit
Does everything come out your mouth got to be a 4-letter word?
All over this bullshit, it's just a bunch of fuckin' noise
The way you talk about women is bullshit, plain bullshit
What you motherfuckers doin' for the black community anyway?
Motherfucker I got kids, I don't want 'em listenin' to that bullshit
{*hospital monitor starts beeping*}
Fuck the niggas!
Motherfuckers need to stop
How can you call yourself a nigga and be proud of it?
{*monitor stops beeping - R.I.P.*}
 Flatline
 Bullshit!

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Well it's because motherfuckers wanna blast me
And run me outta my neighborhood
And label me as a dope dealer yo, and say that I'm no good
But I gave out jobs so niggas wouldn't have to go out
Gave em some dope and a corner so they could show out
When the cops came, they gave a fake name
Because the life in the streets is just a head game
So therefore, to make more
A 15-year-old black kid'll go and rob a liquor store
And get shot in the process
He ate up a nine bullet and now he's put to rest

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
I guess it's just the way shit has to be
Back when I was young gettin' a job was murder
Fuck flippin' burgers, cause I deserve a
Nine-to-five I can be proud of, that I can speak loud of
And to help a nigga get out of
Yo! The concrete playground
But most motherfuckers only want you to stay down
But I'm a smart motherfucker you see
One of the best producers in the rap music industry
Gettin' paid like a motherfucker
A young brother, who don't give a fuck about another
Yeah

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because police always wanna harass me
Every time that I'm rollin
They swear up and down that the car was stolen
Make me get face down in the street
And throw the shit out my car on the concrete
In front of a residence
A million white motherfuckers on my back like I shot the President

Why do I call myself a nigga you ask me?
Because my mouth is so motherfuckin' nasty
Bitch this, bitch that, nigga this, nigga that
In the mean while my pockets are gettin' fat
Gettin' paid to say this shit here
Makin' more in a week than a doctor makes in a year
So why not call myself a nigga?
It's better than pullin' the trigger and goin' up the river
And then I get called a nigga anyway
Broke as a motherfucker and locked away, so
So cut out all that bullshit
Yo! I guess I'll be a nigga for life
Niggas, crackers, jews!
If there's hell below, we're all gonna go!

Nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga nigga, please
I'm treated like a fuckin' disease
You say - why do I call myself a nigga so quick?
Cause I can reach in my drawers and pull out a bigger dick, yo
Nigga say nigga we cool but
Cracker say nigga, nigga knocked the fuck up
But I gotta be a fast nigga, to never be the last nigga
Or I'll have to beat yo' ass, nigga
In the city you see action first
Then hear about it later in a verse I curse
Because I'm real with this to keep my shit straight bumpin
Murder, created by the streets of Compton
Now get it from the underground poet
I live it, I see it, and I write it because I know it
And if you think I'm fuckin' your wife
You're motherfuckin' right, yo
'Cause I'm a nigga for life

I love niggas, I love niggas, I love niggas
Because niggas are me
And I should only love that which is me
I love to see niggas (""niggas for life"")
Nigga this, nigga that
The actual fact is that I'm black and bound to attract
The attention of another, I mean the other
But I'm a motherfucker that'll have 'em runnin' for cover
You see, I don't give a fuck about nothin'
Except gettin' paid, gettin' bitches, and issuin' stitches
Which is, all needed to read it and find a rhyme
And then it's time to say, the nigga's here to stay
But what about the fake niggas, the house niggas
To get paid quick they gotta suck a fat dick
But N.W.A. is outta your motherfuckin' range
We ain't gonna change a motherfuckin' thang!

I call myself a nigga cause my skin won't lighten
I call myself a nigga cause the shit that I'm writin
Hypes me, hypes other motherfuckers around me
And that's the reason why they wanna surround me
And ask me - why do I call myself a negro?
Ain't none of their fuckin' business cause I'll let the trigger go
So get out my presence and get out of my sight
Cause MC Ren is a nigga for life

You're a nigga 'til you die
If you're a po' nigga, you're a po' nigga
If you're a rich nigga, you're a rich nigga
But you never stop bein' a nigga
And if you get to be educated you just an educated nigga

 You like that?
Put 'em off
 It's good?
Ow, shit, godamn bitch you bit' my damn
Shit I said suck the mothafucka, you're bitin' it, shit!

Has this ever happened to you?
Does her teeth get in the way while she's sucking your dick?
Does she know how to suck a dick?
Well, I had that same problem until my bitch went out and bought N.W.A's new book entitled ""The Art of Sucking Dick""

Lesson 1 - First you grab the dick
Next you gently lick it up and down, then insert it into the mouth
Take it slow, don't rush it, and before you know it ..
SPLASH!

It goes one for the treble (treble), two for the bass (bass)
She got nut all over her face
Kick kick it ...

Slow is the tempo, and Ren is gonna flow
As I produce and illustrate you to a ho
Caught on the late night, stomping on the base-pipe
She's a hype to get you on the late flight
But back in school she was a cutie, yo
Then after graduation started giving up the booty
In school, stuck up, hair in a feather
Every time I asked her for the time
It was never ever what she would talk to the Ren I'm sayin'
I wanted a date, she wouldn't even be my friend
But now in the 1990's, I be praying that the bitch don't find me
Cause she's got a gang o' kidz, nappy-heads and all dirty
And she's getting pimped by a nigga that's thirty
I saw her hanging in an alley
Braggin' to her friends how she's ho'in' in the valley
All by herself, doin' on the ho stroll
Comin back home late night with the bankroll
You know a bitch like that makes me sick
But I've heard that she sucks a good dick!

It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it (yeah)

At a high school dance, me and the niggas bailed in
I saw her sittin' with her friends, with the clan
So sexy, thought she was all that
She wouldn't even look at us because we wore the black hat
She was a stuck-up bitch on the public floor
But an instant prostitute behind closed doors
On the streets she's a late night feature
Walking home from school, I saw her sucking a nigga's dick under the bleachers
She saw me and she ran and tried to hide her face
But a bitch full of nut couldn't escape in the chase
A disgrace, If I ever ever saw one
There wasn't a nigga on the block late at night not getting done
So she begged me not to tell a soul
Then I said of course, cause my dick, yo, it's harder than a totem pole
Then again it don't concern me
Cause there's a slight chance if I fuck she might burn me
And then I might have to shoot the ho
I mean check her with the quickness just to let her know
But to prevent from getting sick
I would just prefer to let her come and suck my dick
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it (yeah)

Now I was at a club on a late late Sunday
Peeping at the bitches 'till the next day Monday
Had a couple of drinks, so I was feeling good
And suddenly I saw this bitch  that lives in my neighborhood
She went to church every week so now I lucked up
She was at the end of the bar gettin' fucked up
Back at the house she would bitch n' be ignoring
And when she start to talk the ho' was kinda boring
Yo, but now I got 'til dawn, see
Now she's dancing on the floor with a skirt and no panties on
Shaking that ass like a salt shaker
I already got my plans
Just while I'm a take her to a room
But yo I mean a restroom
And stick my dick in her mouth like a wet broom
So I grab her hand and she's wit' it
But when she turns sober, she'll never admit it
So while she's drunk I'd better get it quick
And see for myself if she sucks a good dick
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
""What do you want me to do with it?""
Don't matter just don't bite it
""It's the big dick and I want it sucked""
She swallowed it (yeah)
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
It's the world's biggest dick
Don't matter just don't bite it
But does she suck a good dick?
Don't matter just don't bite it
She swallowed it

""So there you have it - a job well done (She swallowed it)
But for now let me get back to what I was doing"" (She swallowed it)
Get it
What the fuck suck this dick bitch
Yeah, here comes
Ooh shit, goddamn
(You like that?)
Goddamn
Get it all baby, get it all
Suck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy baby
(You like that too?)
Suck this dick
You know you like it
Suck it
Now, now, now, now, oh she swallowed it
She swallowed, oh shit, get it all, get it all, suck this dick, suck this dick, suck this dick for daddy, hey! Haha!
Wait till I tell the fellas how you sucked this dick

You are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge

Straight outta Compton, it's a crazy brotha named Ice Cube
From the stupid-dope gang wit a attitude
When I'm called off, I gotta sawed-off
Kick knowledge and bodies are hauled off
You too boy if you get with me
The police are gonna have to come and get me
Off yo back, that's how I'm going out
For the sucka dumb brothas that's showing out
Some start to mumble, they wanna rumble
Mix em and cook em in a pot like gumbo
Going off on everybody like that
With bass that's droppin' in your face
So give it up smooth
Ain't no telling when I'm down for a jack move
Here's a murder rap to keep you dancing
With a crime record like Charles Manson
Yo Dre, what's the sound of my tool?
Now you know that I'm about to act a fool
Me you can go toe to toe, no maybe
I'm knocking suckas out the box, daily
Yo weekly, monthly and yearly
Until the whole damn world see clearly
That I'm down with the capital C-P-T
Boy, you can't step to me
So when I'm in your neighborhood, you better duck down
Cause Ice Cube will damn sure buck 'em down
As I leave, believe I'm stomping
But when I come back boy, I'm coming straight outta Compton
You might also like
Yo Ren

Whassup

Tell em where you from

Straight outta Compton, a brotha with his finger on the trigger
More punks I take out, my rep gets bigger
I'm a ruthless villain and you know this
But the suckas in the public won't show this
But I don't really care, I'mma make my snaps
If not from the records, from jacking the craps
It's like burglary, the definition is jacking
And when illegally armed it's called packing
Knock a fool out in a sec
I find somebody talkin' trash and put em in check
So if you're at a show in the front row
I'mma call you a sucka if you don't go with the flow
You'll probably get mad like a punk is supposed to
But that shows me, yo, you're composed to
A crazy young brotha from the street
Attitude legit cause I'm ready to hit
MC Ren controls the automatic
For any fool in my way that starts static
Not the right hand cause I'm the hand itself
Every time I pull a AK off the shelf
The security is maximum and that's a law
R-E-N spells Ren but I'm raw
See, cause people know me as a villain
The definition is clear, you're the witness of a killing
That's taking place without a clue
And once you're on the scope, you know you're through
Look, you might take it as a trip
But a brotha like Ren is on a gangsta tip
Straight outta Compton
Eazy is his name and the boy is coming

Straight outta Compton
Is a brother that'll smother your mother
And make your sister think I love her
Dangerous young brotha raising hell
And if I ever get caught, I make bail
See I don't really care, that's the problem
When I see a police, I don't dodge him
But I'm smart, lay low, creep a while
And when I see the punk pass, I smile
To me it's kinda funny, the attitude showing suckas driving
But don't know where the hell they going, just rolling
Looking for the one they call Eazy
But here's a flash, they never seize me
Ruthless
Never seen like a shadow in the dark
Except when I unload
You see I'll get over the hesitation
And hear the scream of the one who got the lead penetration
Feel a little gust of wind and now I'm jetting
And leave a memory no one'll be forgetting
So what about the girl who got shot 
You think I give a damn about a girl, I ain't a sucker
This is the autobiography of the E
And if you ever mess with me
You'll get taken by a stupid dope brother who will smother
Word to the mother, yeah!

Yeah, it's me again
So check it out - ladies, not gentlemen
Drop your draws, cop a seat
And let's get into this, yeah

Easily I'm approachin', there ain't no jokin'
When the pussy holes are open
Ready to fuck until my dick is raw
Yo! the muthafuckin' devil's son-in-law
(Peter Peter, the Pussy-eater)
No it's the E, the mothafuckin' pussy-beater
And I’m the quicker-picker-up, I'm quick to pick up a bitch
So come here bitch and lick up and lick up and lick up the dick
Now how many nuts would it take for me
To let that bitch graduate to lesson three, let's see
(Splash splash splash splash splash splash)
As you can see I straight waxed that ass
Back up bitch unless you want nut in your eye
I never never ever ever seen a bitch cry
Nut one, nut two, nut four, five, six
I lost the third nut in the mix, fuck it!
(Ayo Yella boy, won't you rewind it)
Six, five, four, now three is up
Gimme that gimme that gimme that nut
You wanna feel the dick baby try your luck
Because the E likes to fuck fuck fuck yo
I get 'em stuck-on and get the fuck on
Give 'em a Tootsie Roll and tell 'em thanks for the pussy hole
I find 'em fuck 'em and flee you know
But before I D.O. - yo I take a ho to the hotel
To the motel, to the holiday inn
Yo, if that bitch start fuckin' up (What you do?)
I'll just fuck her friend

Ah Dr. Dre

Yo
It's on you - so what the fuck you're gonna do?

Well, it's on and on and on and on
Yo the beat don't stoppin' 'till the break o' dawn
Yo, every bitch I know they wanna get with me
The motherfuckin' notorious D-R-E
Spit game at a bitch while a nigga's around
And you know most ho's knows not to clown
Cause if a bitch tries to diss me while I'm full of liquor
I smack the bitch up and shoot the nigga that's with her
That's the kind of nigga that you're listenin' to
Talk to you for a minute then my dick's in you
Yo now every single bitch got a price to pay
Up on the dicks of N.W.A
I find 'em fuck 'em and flee you know
But before I D.O. - yo, I take a hoe to the hotel
To the motel, to the holiday inn (say what?)
If that bitch start fuckin' up, yo
I'll just fuck her friend
Now MC Ren
What up?

A check it out
It's on you - so what the fuck you're gonna do?

Now gather around y'all, and check it out y'all
And all the bitches come and suck up on my balls y'all
And take a ticket to play with it like a Slinky
So put your lips on my big chocolate twinkie
And you swallow all the nut if you bitches are smart
To make my dick pop up like a Pop-Tart
But after I nut I'mma leave ya
But first I must deceive ya, because bitch I don't need ya
And don't say that you love me too
Cause if I turn my back you would fuck the whole crew
You're nothin' but a stank ho' tryin' to take my bank ho'
So I have to let you know  at a hotel
And a motel and a holiday inn (say what?)

Clear all the madness, I'm not a racist
Preach to teach to all ('Cause, some, they never had this)
Number one, not born to run, about the gun

So here it is again, another def jam
But since I gave you all a little something that I knew you lacked
They still consider me a new jack
All the critics, you can hang 'em, I'll hold the rope
But they hope to the Pope, and pray it ain't dope

Don't tell me that you understand until you hear the man
The book of the new school rap game
Writers treat me like Coltrane, insane
Yes to them, but to me I'm a different kind
We're brothers of the same mind, unblind
Caught in the middle and not surrendering
I don't rhyme for the sake of riddling
Some claim that I'm a smuggler
Some say I never heard of ya, a rap burglar

Coming from the school of hard knocks
Some perpetrate, they drink Clorox
Attack the Black, because I know they lack exact
The cold facts, and still they try to Xerox
The leader of the new school, uncool
Never played the fool, just made the rules
Remember there's a need to get alarmed
Again I said I was a time bomb
In the daytime radio's scared of me
'Cause I'm mad, plus I'm the enemy
They can't come on and play me in prime time
'Cause I know the time, 'cause I'm getting mine
I get on the mix late in the night
They know I'm living right, so here go the mic—sike
Before I let it go, don't rush my show
You try to reach and grab and get elbowed
Word to Herb, yo, if you can't swing this
Learn the words, you might sing this
Just a little bit of the taste of the bass for you
As you get up and dance at the LQ
When some deny it, defy it, I swing Bolos
And then they clear the lane I go solo
The meaning of all of that, some media is the wack
As you believe it's true
It blows me through the roof
Suckers, liars, get me a shovel
Some writers I know are damn devils
From them I say, don't believe the hype
(Yo, Chuck, they must be on the pipe, right?)
Their pens and pads I'll snatch 'cause I've had it

Never badder than bad 'cause the brother is madder than mad
At the fact it's corrupt like a senator
Soul on a roll, but you treat it like soap on a rope
'Cause the beats and the lines are so dope
Listen for lessons I'm sayin' inside music that the critics are all blastin' me for
They'll never care for the brothers and sisters, why? 'Cause the country has us up for the war

My DJ is warm, he's X, I call him Norm, ya know
He can cut a record from side to side
So what, the ride, the glide should be much safer than a suicide
Soul control, beat is the father of your rock'n'roll
Music for whatcha, for whichin', you call a band, man
Making a music, abuse it, but you can't do it, ya know
You call 'em demos, (but we ride limos, too)
Whatcha gonna do? Rap is not afraid of you
Beat is for Sonny Bono, (Beat is for Yoko Ono)
Run-DMC first said a DJ could be a band
Stand on its own feet, get you out your seat
Beat is for Eric B. and LL as well, hell
Wax is for Anthrax, still it can rock bells
Ever forever, universal, it will sell
Time for me to exit, Terminator X-it

Turn it up! Bring the noise!

Yo, they should know by now that they can't stop this bum rush
Word up, better keep tellin' me to turn it down

X to sign checks, play to get paid

Hey yo, Griff, get thirty S1W, we got to handle this
We ain't goin' out like that

'F the Police' but who's stopping you from killing me?
Disaster, fiascos over a loop by P.E

Yo Chuck, kick it to 'em, man!
""A ballad behind bars, or you could say real rock from the rock. An unusual musical happening in a most unusual place. The state prison...""
""Get in that cell, nigga!""
I got a letter from the government the other day
I opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They wanted me for their army or whatever
Picture me giving a damn, I said never
Here is a land that never gave a damn
About a brother like me and myself because they never did
I wasn't with it, but just that very minute it occurred to me
The suckers had authority
Cold sweating as I dwell in my cell, how long has it been?
They got me sitting in the state pen
I gotta get out, but that thought was thought before
I contemplated a plan on the cell floor
I'm not a fugitive on the run
But a brother like me begun to be another one
(Word) Public enemy serving time
They drew the line, y'all, to criticize me for some crime
Nevertheless, they could not understand that I'm a Black man
And I could never be a veteran
On the strength, the situation's unreal
I got a raw deal, so I'm looking for the steel
You might also like
They got me rotting in the time that I'm serving
Telling you what happened the same time they're throwing
Four of us packed in a cell like slaves, oh well
The same motherfucker got us living in his hell
You have to realize, what is a form of slavery
Organized under a swarm of devils
Straight up - word 'em up on the level
The reasons are several, most of them federal
Here is my plan anyway, and I say
I got gusto, but only some I can trust, yo
Some do a bid from 1 to 10
But I never did, and plus I never been
I'm on a tier where no tears should ever fall
Cell block and locked, I never clock it, y'all
'Cause time and time again
Time, they got me serving to those, to them I'm not a citizen
But ever when I catch a C-O
Sleeping on the job, my plan is on go-ahead
On the strength, I'ma tell you the deal
I got nothing to lose
'Cause I'm going for the steel

Don't you know I caught a C-O
Falling asleep on death row
I grabbed his gun, and he did what I said so
And every man's demand got served
Along with the time they served, decency was deserved
To understand my demands
I gave a warning, I wanted the governor, y'all
And plus the warden to know
That I was innocent because I'm militant
Posing a threat, you bet it's fucking up the government
My plan said I had to get out and break north
Just like Oliver's neck, I had to get off
My boys had the feds in check
They couldn't try nothing
We had a force to instigate a prison riot
This what it takes for peace
So I just took a piece
Black for Black inside time to cut the leash
Freedom to get out to the ghetto, no sell out
6 C-Os we got, we ought to put their head out
But I'll give 'em a chance, 'cause I'm civilized
As for rest of the world, they can't realize
A cell is hell, I'm a rebel, so I rebel
Between bars, got me thinking like an animal
Got a woman C-O to call me a copter
She tried to get away, and I popped her
Twice, right? Now who wanna get nice?
I had 6 C-Os, and now it's 5 to go
And I'm serious, call me delirious
But I'm still a captive, I gotta wrap this
Time to break as time grows intense
I got the steel in my right hand, now I'm looking for the fence
As I ventured into the courtyard
Followed by 52 brothers, bruised, battered, and scarred but hard
Going out with a bang, ready to bang out
But power from the sky, from the tower shots rang out
A high number of dose, yes, and some came close
I figure I trigger my steel, I still stand and hold my post
This is what I mean, an anti-nigga machine
If I come out alive, then they won't come clean
Then I threw up, my steel bullets flew up
And to my surprise the water tower blew up, who shot
What, who, what, the bazooka was who
And to my rescue, it was the S1Ws
Secured my getaway, so I just got away
The joint broke from the black smoke
Then they saw it was rougher than the average bluffer
'Cause the steel was black, the attitude exact
Now the chase is on, telling you to c'mon
53 brothers on the run, and we are gone8Embed",https://images.genius.com/04e955b7303db3639fb9b82dc57b81b2.709x709x1.jpg

""Hey!""
""This—""
""This is a journey—""
""—jour—""
""—journey, through sound""
""Would you join me, please, in welcome-in-ing—""
""Hahahaha""

I got so much trouble on my mind
Refuse to lose
Here's your ticket;
Hear the drummer get wicked
The crew to you to push the back to Black attack
So I sack and jack, then slapped the Mac
Now I'm ready to mic it
(You know I like it) huh
Hear my favoritism roll ""Oh""
Never be a brother like, ""Me go solo""
Laser, anesthesia, maze ya
Ways to blaze your brain and train ya
The way I'm livin', forgiven, what I'm givin' up
X on the flex, hit me now
I don't know about later
As for now, I know how to avoid the paranoid
Man, I've had it up to here
Yeah, I wear got 'em going in fear
Rhetoric said and read just a bit ago
Not quitting, though signed the hard rhymer
Work to keep from getting jerked
Checkin' some ways (Ways)
To way back in the better days
Raw metaphysically bold, never followed a code
Still dropped a load
Never question what I am, God knows, huh!
'Cause it's coming from the heart
What I got, better get some
Get on up, hustler of culture
Snake bitten, been spit in the face, huh!
But the rhymes keep fittin'
Respect's been given, how's ya livin'
Now I can't protect, a paid-off defect
Check the record and reckon an intentional wreck
Played, off as some intellect
Made the call, took the fall, broke the laws
Not my fault that they're fallin' off
Known as fair and square throughout my years
So I growl at the livin' foul
Black to the bone, my home is your home
But welcome to the Terrordome

""Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...""

So long now, have a good trip!
Yo, yo, who put this thing together, huh? Me!
Me, that's who!
Who I trust? Who I trust?
Me, that's who!
Yo, who you trust, man?

Subordinate terror, kickin' off an era
Cold deliverin' pain
My '98 was '87 on a record, yo
So now I go Bronco
(Oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Oh-oh-oh oh-oh-oh Chuck, they out to get us, man!
Yo, we gotta dust these boys off!)
Crucifixion ain't no fiction
So-called chosen frozen
Apology made to whoever pleases
Still they got me like Jesus
I rather sing, bring, think, reminisce
'Bout a brother while I'm in sync
Every brother ain't a brother 'cause a color
Just as well could be undercover
Backstabbed, grabbed a flag from the back of the lab
Told a Rab get off the rag
Sad to say, I got sold down the river
Still some quiver when I deliver
Never to say I never knew or had a clue
Word was Herb, plus hard on the boulevard
Lies, scandalizin', basin'
Traits of hate, who's celebratin' with Satan?
I rope-a-dope the evil with righteous, bobbin' and weavin'
And let the good get even
C'mon down (C'mon!)
But welcome to the Terrordome
Come on down
Ohhh (Get down)
(Come on, you can get it, get it, get it)
Come on down
Ohhh (Get down)
(Come on, you can get it, get it, get it)

Caught in the race against time, the pit and the pendulum
Check the rhythm and rhymes while I'm bending 'em
Snakes blowing up the lines of design (Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...)
Trying to blind the science I'm sending 'em
How to fight the power, cannot run and hide
But it shouldn't be suicide
In a game, a fool without the rules
Got a hell of a nerve to just criticize
Every brother ain't a brother
'Cause a black hand squeezed on Malcolm X the man
The shooting of Huey Newton
From a hand of a Nig who pulled the trig

Come on down
Come on down
(Come on)
""Would you join me please in welcome-in-ing...""
It's weak to speak and blame somebody else
When you destroy yourself
First, nothin' worse
Than a mother's pain of a son slain in Bensonhurst
Can't wait for the state to decide the fate
So this jam I dedicate
Places with the racist faces
Example, one of many places
Greek, week-end, speech, I speak
From a lesson, learned in Virginia
I don't smile in the line of fire, I go wildin'
But it's on bass and drums, even violins
Whatcha do, getcha head ready
Instead of getting physically sweaty
When I get mad, I put it down on a pad, huh!
Give ya something that ya never had
Controllin', fear of high rollin'
God bless your soul and keep livin'
Never allowed, kickin' it loud
Droppin' a bomb, brain game, intellectual Vietnam
Move as a team, never move alone
But welcome to the Terrordome2Embed",https://images.genius.com/04e955b7303db3639fb9b82dc57b81b2.709x709x1.jpg

""Brothers and sisters! Brothers and sisters, I don't know what this world is coming to!""

Yes, the rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause, I'm lowering my level
The hard rhymer -- where you never been, I'm in
You want stylin'? You know it's time again
D, the enemy, tellin' you to hear it
They praised the music, this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album, The Show
Bum Rush, the sound -- I made a year ago
I guess you know, you guess I'm just a radical
Not on sabbatical, yes, to make it critical
The only party your body should be partyin' to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

Ay yo, Chuck, man, I don't understand this, man!
Yo, you got to slow down, man, you losin' them!

Radio—suckers never play me
On the mix, they just okay me
Now, known and grown, when they're clocking my zone, it's known
Snaking and taking everything that a brother owns
Hard — my calling card
Recorded and ordered, supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud, kicking live next, poet supreme
Loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme
(Flavor) A rebel in his own mind
Supporter of my rhyme
Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime
They on my time ticket

Ay yo, Chuck, they think we takin' shorts!
Show 'em this is cold medina, man!
Come on, kick it!

Terminator X, Terminator X
Terminator X, Terminator

Yo, Chuck, you gettin' 'em nervous
They can't handle this, they gonna break down!

From a rebel, it's final on black vinyl
Soul, rock and roll coming like a rhino
Tables turn, suckers burn to learn
They can't disable the power of my label
Def Jam, tells you who I am
The enemy's public, they really give a damn
Strong Island, where I got 'em whylin'
That's the reason they're claiming that I'm violent
Never silent, no dope, getting dumb — nope
Claiming where we get our rhythm from
Number one, we hit ya, and we give ya some
No gun, and still never on the run
You wanna be an S1 -- Griff will tell you when
And then you'll come again, you'll know what time it is
Impeach the president, pulling out my ray gun
Zap the next one, I could be your Shogun
(Suckers) don't last a minute
Soft and smooth, I ain't with it
(Hardcore) raw bone like a razor
I'm like a laser, I just won't graze ya
Old enough to raise ya, so this'll faze ya
Get it right, boy, maybe I will praise ya
Playing the role, I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
(Smooth) Not what I am
(Rough) 'Cause I'm a man
No matter what the name, we're all the same
Pieces in one big chess game
(Yeah!) The voice of power
Is in the house — go take a shower, boy
P.E. a group, a crew — not singular
We wear black Wranglers
We're rap stranglers, you can't angle us
I know you're listening
I caught you pissin' your pants
You're scared of dissing us
The crowd is missing us
We're on a mission y'all
Yo Chuck, yo! Yeah, man!
Yo, you got 'em runnin' scared!

Terminator X, Terminator X
Terminator X, Terminator

Attitude, when I'm on fire
Juice on the loose, electric wire
Simple and plain, give me the lane
I'll throw it down your throat like Barkley
You see my car keys, you'll never get these
They belong to the Nine-Eight posse
You want some more, son? You wanna get some?
Bum-rush the door of the store — pick up the album
You know the rhythm, the rhyme plus the beat is designed
So I can enter your mind, boys!
Bring the noise — my time
Step aside for the flex, Terminator X

Yeah, that's right
This jam is rated cold medina, boy
That's right, cold medina, that's right
We showin' up in E-F-F-E-C-T, also known as effect
You understand what I'm sayin'?
Yeah! Yeah, boy!

One love y'all
Yeah that's right, He Got Game
PE 1998

If man is the father, the son is the center of the earth
In the middle of the universe, then why
Is this verse comin' six times rehearsed?
Don't freestyle much but I write 'em like such (Word)
Amongst the fiends controlled by the screens
What does it all mean, all this shit I'm seein'?
Human beings screaming vocal javelins
Signs of a local nigga unravelling (uh huh)
My wanderin' got my ass wondering
Where Christ is in all this crisis?
Hatin' Satan never knew what nice is
Check the papers while I bet on ices
More than your eye can see and ears can hear
Year by year all the sense disappears
Nonsense perseveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'
But damn the game if it don't mean nothin'
What is game? Who got game?
Where's the game in life, behind the game behind the game
I got game, she's got game
We got game, they got game, he got game
It might feel good, it might sound a little somethin'

White men in suits don't have to jump
Still a thousand and one ways to lose with his shoes
God takes care of old folks and fools
While the devil takes care of makin' all the rules
Folks don't even own themselves
Payin' mental rent to corporate presidents (My man, my man)
Ugh, one outta million residents
Bein' dissident, who ain't kissin' it
The politics of chains and whips
Got the sick missin' chips and all the championships
What's Love Got To Do with what you got
Don't let a win get to your head or a loss to your heart (Word)
Nonsense perseveres, prayers laced with fear
Beware, two triple O is near

That are written on the walls of life
Then universally, we will stand and divided we will fall

Wake up and take control of your own cipher

Don't you see how late they're reacting?
They only come and they come when they wanna
So get the morgue truck and embalm the goner
They don't care 'cause they stay paid anyway
They treat you like an ace that can't beat a trey
A no-use number with no-use people
If your life is on the line then you're dead today
Latecomers with the late coming stretcher
That's a body bag in disguise y'all, I'll betcha
I call 'em body snatchers cause they come to fetch ya
With an autopsy ambulance just to dissect ya
They are the kings cause they swing amputation
Lose you arms or legs to their miscalculation

Bass in your face, not an eight track
Gettin' it good to the wood
So the people give you some of that reactin' to the facts
That I kick and it stick and it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin, goin, deep to the roots
Ain't givin' it up, so turn me loose
But then again I got a story that's harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust, I'm talkin' 'bout the one still goin' on
I know where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland, the place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack
And fooled the black, and left us faded
King and chief, probably had a big beef
Because of that now I grit my teeth
So here's a song to the strong

Ugh, rollin' in my own leftover
When I roll over, I roll over in somebody else
90 damn days on a slave ship
Count them fallin' off 1, 2, 3, 4 hundred at a time
Blood in the wood and it's mine
I'm chokin' on, spit, feelin' pain
Like my brain bein' chained
Still gotta give it what I got
But it's hot in the day, it's cold in the night
But I thrive to survive, I pray to god to stay alive
My attitude boils up inside
And that ain't it, you think I ever quit
Still I plan to get my hands around the neck of the man with the whip
3 months passed, they brand a label on my ass
To signify I'm owned, I'm on the microphone
Sayin' 1555, how I'm livin'
We been livin' here, livin' ain't the word, I been givin'
Haven't got, classify us in the have-nots
Fightin' haves cause it's all about money ""damn""
When it comes to Armageddon mean I'm getting mine
Here I am turn it over Sam
427 to the year, do you understand
That's why it's hard for the black to love the land
Once again, bass in your face, not an eight track
Gettin' it good to the wood
So the people give you some of that reactin' to the facts
That I kick and it stick and it stay around
Pointin' to the joint, put the Buddha down
Goin, goin, gettin' to the roots
Ain't givin' it up, so turn me loose
But then again I got a story that's harder than the hardcore
Cost of the holocaust, I'm talkin' 'bout the one still goin' on
I know where I'm from, not dum diddie dum
From the base motherland, the place of the drum
Invaded by the wack diddie wack
And fooled the black, and left us faded
King and chief, probably had a big beef
Because of that now I grit my teeth
So here's a song to the strong
Bout the shake of the snake and the smile went along
With that, can't truss it

Can't truss it, can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it
You can't truss it, you can't truss it

Burn Hollywood burn I smell a riot
Goin' on -- first they're guilty, now they're gone
Yeah I'll check out a movie
But it'll take a Black one to move me
Get me the hell away from this T.V
All this news and views are beneath me
So all I hear about is shots ringing out
About gangs putting each other's head out
So I rather kick some slang out
All right fellas let's go hang out
Hollywood or would they not
Make us all look bad like I know they had
But some things I'll never forget, yeah
So step and fetch this shit
For all the years we looked like clowns
The joke is over -- smell the smoke from all around
Burn Hollywood burn

Ice Cube is down with the P.E
Now every single bitch wanna see me
Big Daddy is smooth, word to mother
Let's check out a flick that exploits the color
Roaming through Hollywood late at night
Red and blue lights what a common sight
Pulled to the curb, getting played like a sucker
Don't fight the power *gunshot* the motherfucker

As I walk the streets of Hollywood Boulevard
Thinking how hard it was to those that starred
In the movies portraying the roles
Of butlers and maids, slaves and hoes
Many intelligent Black men seemed
To look uncivilized when on the screen
Like, I guess I figure you to play some jigaboo
On the plantation, what else can a nigga do
And Black women in this profession
As for playing a lawyer, out of the question
For what they play Aunt Jemima is the perfect term
Even if now she got a perm
So let's make our own movies like Spike Lee
Cause the roles being offered don't strike me
As nothing that the black man could use to earn

Yo Chuck, bust a move man
I was on my way up here to the studio, you know what I'm saying?
And this brother stopped me and asked me, ""Yo, what's up with that brother Chuckie D, he swear he nice?""
I said, ""Yo, the brother don't swear he nice, he knows he's nice"", you know what I'm saying?
So Chuck, we got a feeling you turning into a Public Enemy, man
Now remember that line you was kicking to me on the way out to L.A. Laurelton Queens while we was in the car on our way to the shop?
Well yo, right now, kick the bass for them brothers and let 'em know... What, goes, on!
What goes on? Well...

I'm all in, put it up on the board
Another rapper shot down from the mouth that roared
One, two, three, down for the count
The result of my lyrics, oh yes, no doubt
Cold rock rap, forty-niner supreme
Is what I choose and I use, I never lose to a team
'Cause I can go solo like a Tyson bolo
Make the fly girls wanna have my photo
Run in their room, hang it on the wall
In remembrance that I rocked them all
Suckers, ducks, ho-hum emcees
You can't rock the kid, so go cut the cheese
Take this application of rhymes like these
My rap's red hot, hundred ten degrees
So don't start bassing, I'll start placing
Bets on that you'll be disgracing
You and your mind from my beating from my rhymes
A time for a crime that I can't find
I'll show you my gun, my Uzi weighs a ton
Because I'm Public Enemy number one
You might also like
One, one, one
One, one, one, one!
(One, one, one, hoo-hah!)

You got no rap, but you want to battle
It's like having a boat, but you've got no paddle
'Cause I never pause, I say it because
I don't break in stores, but I break all laws
Written while sitting, all bidding not hidden
Giving me the juice that you're not getting
I'm not a law obeyer, so you can tell your mayor
I'm a non-stop, rhythm rock, poetry sayer
I'm the rhyme player, the ozone layer
A battle what? Here's a bible, start your prayer
This word to the wise is justified
If they ask you what happened, just admit you lied
You just got caught up for going out of order
And now you're serving football teams their water
You messed with the Master, word to Chuck
And I waxed cold taxed, make sure you got dunked
You just got dissed, all but dismissed
Sucker duck emcees, you get me pissed
It's no fun being on the run
Because they got me Public Enemy number one
One, one, one
One, one, one, one!
Don't you know, don't you know

I got a posse of a force to back me up
Watch out, we got mettle to match
Ambush attack on my back, double-team you get creamed
So we have it, so you won't catch
Wanna hear it again? We got a force, enemy down
The L.I. circuit sound
And Chuckie D, myself, and K-Jee
Flavor, DJ Melo-D
Oh yes, I presume it's the tunes that make us groom
To make all the ladies swoon
But it's also the words from our direction, the homeboy section
Kicking like Bruce Lee's ""Chinese Connection""
On stereo, never ever mono
On wax, yes, I'm talking about vinyl
They said ""Stop! Freeze!"", I got froze up
Because I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one
One, one, one!
For all you
Suckers, liars, your cheap amplifiers
Your crossed up wires are always starting fires
You grown up criers, now here's a pair of pliers
Get a job like your mother, heard she fixes old dryers
You have no desires, your father fixes tires
You try to sell your equipment but you get no buyers
It's you they never hire, you're never on flyers
'Cause you and your crew is only known as good triers
Known as the poetic, political, lyrical son
I'm Public Enemy number one

One, one, one
One, one, one
One, one, one!

Yeah, that's right Chuck, man
That's what you gotta do
You gotta tell 'em just like that, you know what I'm saying
'Cause yo man, let me tell you a little something man
These brothers running around, hard headed
They get a little jealous, you know what I'm saying
Just like that, you know, they're trying to bring you down with them
But yo Chuck, you got to let them know who's who in the world to be
You got to let them know, that this is the 80's
And we can get all the ladies
And in the backyard we got a fly Mercedes
And that's the way the story goes

This is Sister Souljah. Public Enemy, Security of the First World, and all allied forces are traveling west to head off a white supremacy scheming to destroy the national celebration of Martin Luther King's birthday. Public Enemy believes that the powers that be in the states of New Hampshire and Arizona have found psychological discomfort in paying tribute to a black man who tried to teach white people the meaning of civilization. Good luck brothers, show 'em what you got

I'm countin' down to the day deservin', fittin' for a king
I'm waitin' for the time when I can get to Arizona
'Cause my money is spent for the goddamn rent
Neither party is mine, not the jackass or the elephant
Twenty thousand niggy-niggy brothers in the corner
Of the cell block, but they come from California
Population is none in the desert and sun
With a gun cracker runnin' things under his thumb
Starin' hard at the postcards, isn't it odd and unique
Seein' people smile wild in the heat?
A hundred-twenty degree, 'cause I want to be free
What's a smilin' face when the whole state's racist?
Why I want a holiday? Damn it, 'cause I wanna
So what if I celebrate it standin' on a corner?
I ain't drinkin' no forty, thinkin' time with a nine
'Til we get some land, call me the trigger man
Lookin' for the governor, huh? He ain't lovin' ya, ha?
But here to trouble ya, he's rubbin' ya wrong
Get the point and come along, he can get to the joint
I urinated on the state while I was kickin' this song
Yeah, he appear to be fair
The sucker over there, he try to keep it yesteryear
The good ol' days, the same ol' ways that kept us dyin'
Yes - you, me, myself, and I, indeed
What he need is a nosebleed
Read between the lines, and then you see the lie
Politically planned, but understand, that's all she wrote
When we see the real side that hide behind the vote
And they can't understand why he the man, I'm singin' about a king
They don't like it when I decide to mic it
Wait, I'm waitin' for the date
For the man, who demands respect 'cause he was great, c’mon
I'm on a one mission to get a politician to honor
Or he's a goner by the time I get to Arizona

Well, I got 25 days to do it
If a wall in the way, just watch me go through it

Through all the static, not stick but automatic
That's the way it is, he gotta get his, talkin' MLK
Gonna find a way
Make the state pay, I'm lookin' for the day
Hard as it seems, this ain't no damn dream
Gotta know what I mean, it's team against team
Catch the light beam

So I pray, I pray every day, I do and praise Jah the maker
Lookin' for culture I got, but not here from Jamaica
Pushin' and shakin' the structure, bringin' down the Babylon
Hearin' the sucker that make it hard for the Brown
The hard boulevard, I need it now more than ever now
Who's sittin' on my freedom, oppressor, people beater
A piece of the pick, we picked a piece of land that we're deserving now
Reparation, a piece of the nation, and damn, he got the nerve
Another nigga they say and classify we want too much
My people plus the whole nine is mine, don't think I even double dutch
Here's a brother, my attitude is hit 'em, hang 'em high
I'm blowing up the 90's, started tickin' in '86
When the blind get a mind, better start fearin' while we sing it now
There will be the day we know who's down and who will go
Go, go, go

The FBI was tappin' my telephone
I never live alone, I never walk alone
My posse's always ready, and they're waitin' in my zone
Although I live the life that of a resident
But I be knowin' the scheme that of the president
Tappin' my phone whose crews abused
I stand accused of doing harm, 'cause I'm louder than a bomb

Come on, come on (Louder!)
Come on, come on (Louder!)
Come on, come on (Louder!)

Why they're tappin' my phone, although I can't keep it a secret
So I decided to kick it, yo
And, yes, it weighs a ton, I say it once again

Takin' the blame is not a waste, here taste
A bit of the song so you can never be wrong
Just a bit of advice, 'cause we be payin' the price
'Cause every brother man's life is like swingin' the dice, right?
Here it is, once again this is the brother to brother
The Terminator, the cutter
Goin' on an' on - leave alone the grown
Get it straight in '88, an' I'll troop it to demonstrate
The posse always ready - 98 at 98
My posse come quick, because my posse got velocity
Tappin' my phone, never leave me alone

Where is Public Enemy? What's the big deal?
What's your latest hit, brother?
(Fear of a Black Planet)

Man, don't you worry 'bout a thing
'Bout your daughter, nope she's not my type
(But suppose she said she loved me?)
Are you afraid of the mix of Black and White?
Livin' in a land where the law say
Mixing of race makes the blood impure
She's a woman I'm a man
Look at your face, I see ya can't stand it


Man you need to calm down, don't get mad
I don't need your sista
But suppose she said she loved me?
Would you still love her or would you dismiss her?
What is pure? Who is pure?
Is it European? I ain't sure
If the whole world was to come through peace and love
Then what would we be made of?

Stop screamin', it's not the end of your life

I'm not the one that's runnin', but they got me on the run

""And there's sure to be a change in ways""
Now, there's a cheerleader that's a real big bleeder
As far as I can reminisce
But the best thing of loving was her sister and her cousin
And it started with a little kiss, like this

See-saw swinging with the boys in school
And her feet was flying up in the air
Singing, ""Hey diddle diddle with the kitty in the middle""
And they swinging like it just don't care
So I took a big chance at the high school dance
With a lady who was ready to play
It wasn't me she was foolin' 'cause she knew what was she was doin'
When she told me how to walk this way
She told me to

Humpty Dumpty fell down, that's his hard time
Jack B. Nimble was nimble and he was quick
But Jam Master cut faster, Jack's on Jay's dick
Now Little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep
And Rip Van Winkle fell the hell asleep
And Alice chilling somewhere in Wonderland
Jack's serving Jill a bucket in his hand
And Jam Master Jay's making all that sound
The turntables might wobble, but they don't fall down

Now Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing
But Jam Master's getting loose and D.M.C.'s the king
'Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator
Jam Master Jay king of the crossfader
He's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest
Perfect timing when I'm climbing, I'm a rhyming apparatus
Lot of guts, when he cuts, girls move their butts
His name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts

He's not Flash, but he's fast and his name is Jay

""God damn that DJ made my day""
Like the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker

If cuts were kids he would be due
Not lying y'all, he's the best I know
And if I lie my nose will grow

I like to sport 'em, that's why I brought 'em
A sucker tried to steal 'em so I caught 'em and I fought 'em

And they are not used as felon shoes
They're black and white, white with black stripes
The ones I like to wear when I rock the mic
On the strength of a famous university

When I seen a man chilling with his dog in the park
I approached him very slowly with my heart full of fear
Looked at his dog, oh my God, an ill reindeer
But then I was illin' 'cause the man had a beard
And a bag full of goodies, 12 o'clock had neared
So I turned my head a second and the man was gone
But he must've dropped his wallet smack dead on the lawn
I picked the wallet up, but then I took a pause
Took out the license and it cold said, ""Santa Claus""
A million dollars in it, cold hundreds of G's
Enough to buy a boat and matching car with ease
But I'd never steal from Santa 'cause that ain't right
So I was going home to mail it back to him that night
But when I got home, I bugged 'cause under the tree
Was a letter from Santa and the dough was for me

It's Christmastime in Hollis, Queens
Mom's cookin' chicken and collard greens
Rice and stuffing, macaroni and cheese
And Santa put gifts under Christmas trees
Decorate the house with lights at night
Snow's on the ground, snow white so bright

Beneath the mistletoe as we drink eggnog

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was Def a-then it went this way
Took a test to become an MC
And Orange Krush became amazed at me
So Larry put me inside his Cadillac
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
Dave cut the record down to the bone
And now they got me rockin' on the microphone
And then we talkin autograph, and cheers and laugh
Champagne caviar, and bubble bath
But see ahh, ah that's the life, ah that I lead
And you sucker MC's is who I please
So take that and move back catch a heart attack
Because there's nothin in the world, that Run'll ever lack
I cold chill at a party in a b-boy stance
And rock on the mic and make the girls wanna dance
Fly like a Dove, that come from up above
I'm rockin' on the mic and you can call me Run-Love

I got a big long Caddy not like a Seville
And written right on the side it reads 'Dressed to Kill'
So if you see me cruisin' girls just a-move or step aside
There ain't enough room to fit you all in my ride
It's on a, ah first come, first serve basis
Coolin' out girl, take you to the def places
One of a kind and for your people's delight
And for you sucker MC, you just ain't right
Because you're bitin' all your life, you're cheatin' on your wife

My man Larry Larr, my name DJ Run
We do it in the place with the highs and the bass
I'm rockin' to the rhythm won't you watch it on my face
Go Uptown and come down to the ground
You sucker MC's, you sad-faced clown
You a five-dollar boy and I'm a-million dollar man
Youse a sucker MC, and you're my fan
You try to bite lines, but rhymes are mine
Youse a sucker MC in a pair of Calvin Kleins
Comin' from the wackest, part of town
Tryin to rap up but you can't get down
You don't even know your English, your verb, or noun
You're just a sucker MC, you sad-faced clown
So D.M.C. and if you're ready
The people rockin' steady
You're drivin' big cars get your gas from Getty

I'm D.M.C., in the place to be
I go to St. John's University
And since kindergarten I acquired the knowledge
And after 12th grade I went straight to college
I'm light-skinned, I live in Queens
And I love eatin' chicken and collard greens
I dress to kill, I love the style
I'm an MC you know who's versatile
Say I got good credit in your regards
Got my name not numbers on my credit cards
I go Uptown, I come back home
With who? Me, myself, and my microphone
All my rhymes are sweet delight
So here's another one for y'all to bite
When I rhyme, I never quit
And if I got a new rhyme I'll just say it
'Cause it takes a lot, to entertain
And sucker MC's can be a pain
You can't rock a party with the hip in hop
You gotta let 'em know you'll never stop
The rhymes have to make a lot of sense
You got to know where to start when the beats commence11Embed",https://images.genius.com/63df3e6293cfcc8c85e004eae35f81f2.580x580x1.jpg

I'm the king of rock, there is none higher
Sucker MCs should call me sire
To burn my kingdom, you must use fire
I won't stop rockin' 'til I retire
Now we rock the party and come correct
Our cuts are on time and rhymes connect
Got the right to vote and will elect
And other rappers can't stand us but give us respect
They called us hip, we're gettin iller
There's no one chiller
It's not Michael Jackson and this is not Thriller
As one def rapper, I know I can hang
I'm Run from Run-DMC, like Kool from Kool and the Gang
Roll to the rock, rock to the roll
DMC stands for devastating mic control
You can't touch me with a ten-foot pole
And I even made the devil sell me his soul
Now we crash through walls, cut through floors
Bust through ceilings and knock down doors
And when we're on the tape, we're fresh out the box
You can hear our sound for blocks and blocks
For every living person we're a verbal treat
It's me and DMC, Jay where's the beat?
You might also likeNow we're the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool
I'm DMC, I rock and roll, I'm DJ Run, I rock and rule
It's not a Trick or Treat and it's not a April Fool
It's all brand new, never ever old school
You got the music in your body and you can't comprehend
When your mind won't wiggle and your knees won't bend
Music ain't nothin but a people's jam
It's DJ Run, DMC, rockin without a band
Now I walked on ice and never fell
I spent my time in a plush hotel
I stood on many stages, held many mics
Take airplane flights, at huge heights
So all you sucker MCs, you gotta say please
'Cause when he jumps high, I'm pulling down ree's
Got a song so strong, it's knocking down trees
Is it hard to believe it's Run-D.M.C.'s?
I am from, around the way
And Run goes to school, every day
And Jay plays the records he has to play
And we get down with no delay, HEY!
I rock the party with the words I speak
And Run says the rhymes that are unique
And Jay cuts the records every day of the week
And we are the crew that can never be meek
So don't try to diss me, try to be my friend
'Cause if you do, you'll get yours in the end
The rhymes we say shall set a trend
Because a devastating rap is what we send
Every jam we play, we break two needles
There's three of us but we're not the Beatles
My name is Darryl, you can call him D
You can call me Darryl Mack, or you can call him DMC
People always ask, ""DMC, what does it mean?""
D's for never dirty, MC for mostly clean
Like we said before, we rock hardcore
I'm DJ Run, I can scratch, I'm DMC, I can draw
And now we got the knack  to attract
Our rhyme's an aphrodisiac
We'll reign on your brain and rock your knot
When it comes to rock, give it all we got
To be MCs, we got what it takes
Let the poppers pop and the breakers break
We're cool, cool cats, it's like that
That's the way it is, so stay the hell back
We're causin' hard times, for sucker MC's
'Cause they don't make no songs like these

They wanna be down with the King!

Down with the king for years, about ten of 'em
Recruiting suckers mackin' mic, and makin' men of 'em
Tears and fears for my peers, they rippin'
You think that it is, it is, if not it isn't
Race for the border my daughter, 'cause beats you're bangin' out
Jeeps rockin' beats in the streets when there's time for hangin' out
Gather, or rather form a circle around a loud
'Cause brothers or others could never ever rock a crowd
Is it because he's runnin' off with the mouth
Or was he really clearly tryin' to play a nigga out
Nope, shut him down, the king with a crown
'Cause all you wanna be is Diggy Down

Down with the king
The king down with the king 
The king

Two years ago, a friend of mine
Asked me to say some MC rhymes
So I said this rhyme I'm about to say
The rhyme was meeca, and it went this way
Recollect a mecca mic check on the windmill skills
Mac distracts, wearing Godfather hats
It's okay to parlay to forte better
Tell 'em my nigga made a sweater tougher than leather
Swing another Rodney King thing and I'll wreck
But just like the white one I get no respect
Money stay awake, 'cause them other niggas are fake
From Hollis to the Beacon, now your dumb ass is leakin'

Big time weight before Hammer got to touch it

These are the roughest toughest words I ever wrote down

Because of all the things that I bring with me
Only G-O-D could be a king to me
And if the G-O-D be in me, then the king I be
The microphone is branded when it's handed to me
I was planted on this planet and I plan to emcee
The emcee fiends only seem to agree
That I rock all the world and the society
Outrageous on the stages with a tune of verse
I give praises from these pages to the universe

Live for you, fresh


For all you sucker MCs perpetratin' a fraud
Your rhymes are cold wack and keep the crowd cold bored
You're the kind of guy that girl ignored
I'm drivin' a Caddy, you fixin' a Ford
My name is Joseph Simmons, but my middle name's Ward
And when I'm rockin' on the mic, you should all applaud
Because we're wheelin', dealin', we got a funny feelin'
We rock from the floor up to the ceilin'
We groove it, you move it, it has been proven
We calm the savage beast because our music is soothin'
We create it, relate it, and often demonstrate it
We'll diss a sucker MC, make the other suckers hate it
We're risin', suprisin', and often hypnotizin'
We always tell the truth and then we never slip no lies in
No curls, no braids peasy-head and still get paid
Jam Master cut the record up and down and cross-fades

Because the rhymes I say sharp as a nail
Witty as can be and not for sale
Always funky fresh, could never be stale
Took a test to become an MC and didn't fail
I couldn't wait to demonstrate
All the super def rhymes that I create
I'm a wizard of a word, that's what you heard
And anything else is quite absurd
I'm the master of a mic, that's what I say
And if I didn't say that, you'd say it any way
Bust into the party, come in the place
See the first things come, the music in your face
Girls on the walls, some on the floor
With the DJ named Jay with the cuts galore
So listen to this because it can't be missed
And you can't leave 'til you're dismissed
You can do anything that you want to
But you can't leave until we're through
So relax your body and your mind
And listen to us say this rhyme, hey
You might think that you have waited
Long enough 'til the rhyme was stated
But if it were a test it would be graded
With a grade that's not debated
Nothing too deep and nothing dense
And all our rhymes make a lot of sense
So move your butt to the cut
Run amok, you're not in a rut
Each and everybody out there, we got the notion
We want to see y'all all in motion
Just shake, wiggle, jump up and down
Move your body to the funky sound
Side to side, back and forth
We're the two MCs and we're gonna go off
Stand in place, walk or run
Tap your feet, you'll be on the one
Just snap your fingers and clap your hands
Our DJ's better than all these bands
Huh
We got all the lines and all the rhymes
We don't drop dimes and we don't do crimes
We bake a little cake with Duncan Hines
And never wear the pants they call the Calvin Kleins
'Cause Calvin Klein's no friend of mine
Don't want nobody's name on my behind
Lee on my legs, sneakers on my feet
D by my side and Jay with the beat (Beat)

One day when I was chillin' in Kentucky Fried Chicken
Just mindin' my business, eatin' food and finger lickin'
This dude walked in lookin' strange and kind of funny
Went up to the front with a menu and his money
He didn't walk straight, kind of side-to-side
He asked this old lady, ""Yo, yo, um, is this Kentucky Fried?""
The lady said ""Yeah"", smiled and he smiled back
He gave a quarter and his order, small fry and Big Mac

You be illin' (Yo, yo, what you tell that kid?), illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'
You be illin', illin'

To-day you won a ticket to see Doctor J
Front row seat (In free), no pay

Game's about to start, you kickin' popcorn to the beat
You finally wake up, Doc's gone to town
Round his back, through the hoop, then you scream, ""Touchdown!""

Drunk as a skunk, you illin', punk, and in your left hand was Bacardi
You went up to this fly girl and said ""Yo, yo, can I get this dance?""
She smelled your breath and then she left you standin' in your illin' stance

It was salty, with butter and it was def
You proceeded to eat it 'cause you was in the mood
But, holmes, you did not read it was a can of dog food

Kings from Queens, from Queens come kings
We're raisin' hell like a class when the lunch bell rings
The king will be praised and hell will be raised
S-S-S-Suckers try to faze him, but D won't be fazed
So what's your name? D.M.C., the King is me
Your Highness, or His Majesty
Now you can debate, you c-c-c-concentrate
But you can't imitate D.M.C. the Great
Dissin' all devils, causin' havoc in Hell
At a very high level bass and treble shall yell
Heard in the heavens are the sounds supreme
So clear to the ear it is sometimes seen
So loud like a cloud with thunder and lightning
So proud to the crowd it is somewhat frightening
No calm in the storm like a beast unleashed
There's no stoppin' 'cause the rockin' cannot cease, break

You see it's harder than hard, not one bit soft
Courageous and contagious, so you better break North
Not a cold, on a roll, did you hear me cough?
Just listen while I'm dissin' 'cause you're pissin' me off
Cold bedding is spreading all across your face
You can't take when I break and if that's the case
I'll go on and on and kick the bass
So back up off the cup while I take my taste

So demanding and commanding that you all stand dazed
The unbelieving receiving prophecy so true

The rock king is so bold when he rocks and roll
A black hat is my crown, symbolizin' the sound
Signifyin', we won't play around, bust it

Rhymin' and climbin', beat-makin' every day
No synthesizer sound, so silence when I say
I am great, get it straight, 'cause that's by fate
My name is Run, I'm number one, that's how I rate
He's in the place with the bass, and style and grace
His name is Jay, he's here to play and win this race
He's off the wall, on the ball, his name is D
Kind of tall, yes, y'all, he's down with me

From the mountain valley to the deep blue sea
The word is heard as told by D
I don't sing, I bring much delight
Like a star shinin' bright in the darkest night
If you are cold, I'll bring you heat
Like I brought the whole world my funky beat
Mysterious and serious, I ain't no joke
Fire from the depths of hell and you can smell the smoke
Kickin' and tickin' while you're havin' a ball
Like chicken, finger lickin' I'll be vickin' you all
So do The Bird, have you heard, did they give you a call?
Just me and D.M.C., cold shakin' the walls
There's no fearin' when hearin' sound of this kind
Across the land every man is goin' out of his mind
On the face of the earth spreading like disease
Contaminating, infiltrating like a horde of bees

Ruler of rock, and king at cold-crushin'

And to the right, y'all, a-to the right, y'all
Because I rock up on the mic all night, y'all

And the shots they take have no effect
The punk tried to dunk, but he broke his neck

It’s not Mary who was quite contrary
Talkin’ bout Mary who was always in a hurry
The things she needed were necessary
She did not need a busted cherry
True and blue just like a blueberry
Ask if she’s crazy and I’ll say very
Livin’ in a house that’s out on the prairie
I worry about Mary, cause Mary is scary
“Mary, Mary!” Why ya buggin’?
“Mary, Mary!” I need ya huggin’

Listen to the Jam Master as he starts to rock
His name is Jay and he's on his way
To be the best DJ in the US of A
J-a-y are the letters of his name
Cutting and scratching are the aspects of his game
So check out the Master as he cuts these jams
And look at us with the mics in our hands
Then take a count, 1 2 3
Jam Master Jay, Run-D.M.C
He's Jam Master Jay, the big beat blaster
He gets better cause he knows he has to
In '84 he'll be a little faster
And only practice makes a real Jam Master
We're live as can be but we're not singing the blues
We got to tell all y'all the good news
The good news is that there is a crew
Not 5, not 4, not 3, just 2
2 MC's who are claiming the fame
And all other things won't be the same
Beacause it's about time for a brand new group
Run-D.M.C. to put you up on the scoop
We make the fly girls scream in ecstacy
We rock the freshest rhymes at a party
We put all the fellas in a daze
It's everyone that we amaze
And we got the master of a disco scratch
There's not a break that he can't catch
Jam Master Jay that is his name
And all wild DJ's he will tame
Behind the turntables is where he stands
Then there is the movement of his hands
So when asked who's the best, y'all should say:
""Run-D.M.C. and Jam Master Jay""
You might also likeJam Master Jay is the one in charge
It's up to him to rock beats that are truly large
He is the master of the scratch and cut
So move your arms, so move your legs
So won't you move your butt
We're not talking ground, we're not talking sky
We're not talking low, we're not talking high
We're not talking big, we're not talking small
We want all of the people on off the wall
We're not talking night, we're not talking day
But we're talking bout Jam Master Jay1Embed",https://images.genius.com/63df3e6293cfcc8c85e004eae35f81f2.580x580x1.jpg

You know I'm proud to be Black, y'all
And that's a fact, y'all
And if you try to take what's mine, I'll take it back, y'all
It's like that

Licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky-licky
Listen, party people, here's a serious song
It's right not wrong, I should say right on
I gotta tell you somethin' that you all should know
It's not a mystery, it's history, and here's how it go
Now Harriet Tubman was born a slave
She was a tiny Black woman, but she was brave
She was livin' to be givin', there's a lot that she gave
There's not a slave in this day and age, I'm proud to be

Black, goddamn, I'm tired, my man
Don't worry 'bout what color I am
Because I'll show you how ill this man can act
It could never be fiction, 'cause it is all fact
And if you get in my way, I will not turn back
I'm proud of my name, my name is Darryl Mack
I'm Black and I'm proud, and I'll say it out loud
I'll share my story with the whole crowd, uh

And if you try to take what's mine, I'll take it back, y'all

DJ Run and I'm running things
You can hear it loud and clear like when the school bell rings
Like Martin Luther King, I will do my thing
I'll say it in a rap 'cause I do not sing

D.M.C., the man that's causin' the grief
I got a message for the world, so listen up, it's brief
Like Malcolm X said, I won't turn the right cheek
Got the strength to go the length if you wanna start beef, start beef

You know I'm proud to be Black, y'all
And real brave, y'all
And motherfucker, I could never be a slave, y'all
So take that

Gonna tell ya somethin', put your mind in a swirl
God bless the next baby that comes in this world
The world's full of hate, discrimination and sin
People judgin' other people by the color of skin
I'll attack this matter in my own way
Man, I ain't no slave, I ain't bailin' no hay
Written a deposition, in any condition
Don't get in my way, 'cause I'm full of ambition
I'm proud to be Black and I ain't takin no crap
I'm fresh out the pack and I'm proud to be Black, so take that
There was a man, an inventor, who invented so well
He invented a fortune for a man named Bell
George Washington Carver made the peanut great
Showed any man with a mind could create
You read about Malcolm X in the history text
Jesse Owens broke records, Ali broke necks
What's wrong with ya, man? How can you be so dumb?

SHUT UP!!!
You talk too much
You talk too much
You talk too much
You talk too much

Hey! You over there, I know about your kind
You're like the Independent Network News on Channel 9
Everywhere that you go, no matter where you are at
I said you talk about this, and you talk about that
When the cat took your tongue, I say you took it right back
Your mouth is so big, one bite could kill a Big Mac

You talk too much
You never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up

You talk about people, you don't even know
And you talk about places, you NEVER go
You talk about your girl, from head to toe
I said your mouth's moving fast, and your brain's moving slow

You talk too much

Homeboy you never shut up

You're the instigator, the orator of the town
You're the worst when you converse, just a big mouth clown
You talk when you're awake, I heard you talk when you sleep
Has anyone ever told you, that talk is cheap?

You talk too much
You never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up (SHUT UP!!!)

Talking is the one thing that you can do best
You told the cavity creeps to watch out for Crest
You never have the story right and exact
And then you always try to bore me with your yakkity yak

You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up (SHUT UP!!!)
Every day you are out fighting someone in the street
And you're always fighting someone you know ya can't beat
Then you wonder how you got in this mess
Just think of what you said, then take a guess

You talk too much
You never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up (SHUT UP!!!)

You're always spreading rumors, whether bad or good
You're the damn Walter Cronkite of the neighborhood
The Barbara Walters and the Howard Cosell
You always come around with a story to tell

You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up (SHUT UP!!!)

Said it's everybody's business that you love to mind
And talkin' to you is like dropping a dime
You're spreading the word like it is your job
You should be a stool pigeon who works for the mob
You talk too much
Then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up!

A big blabbermouth, that's what you are
If you were a talk show host, you'd be a star
I said your mouth is big, size extra large
And when you open it, it's like my garage

You talk too much
And then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up (SHUT UP!!!)

You always like to gossip, just like a girl
You talk so damn much, it's outta this world
When you're reincarnated in your second life
You won't be a man, you'll be a nagging wife

You talk too much
Then you never shut up
I said you talk too much
Homeboy you never shut up! (SHUT UP!!!)

SHUT UP!!!

Twenty-five hours, eight days a week
Thirteen months out a year is when you speak
I'm tired of listening to the garbage you talk
Why don't you find a short pier, then take a long walk?

Born to rock around the clock
You can't say I'm not
And in case you forgot
I'm the king of rock!

I'm the devastating mic controller D.M.C
And can't nobody mess around with me
I'm the king of rock, rap, and of rhyme
I deal what I feel and it feels fine
If the sound from the Jay then I won't play
Around with sound, put down for the rhymes I say
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's rock
Hit it, Run


You just watch your clock while I rock your spot
I'm better known to the world as the king of rock
I like to speak my piece when I'm on the mic
I'm the best, or at least, I'm the one you like
And when I serve, you deserve to hear what I say
I throw a curve, he got the nerve to make a triple play
Now, how devastating can an MC be?
My name is Darryl, but you can call me D

It's called gangsta hard rock, non-stop hip-hop
And it's headed for the top by the rhymes I pop
For every race, place, color, country, county, or creed
And all of the places that I emceed

And you can't be a boy unless you be D
You can't bust a cherry or crush a grape
And if you ain't got this tape, you're in bad shape
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's (Rock)


Do you really believe what's going on?
I was conceived and I was born
I once was lost, but now I'm found
Tell your bunch I'm boss, I run this town
I leave all suckers in the dust
Those dumb motherfuckers can't mess with us
Beats flow from Joe and never stop
Better get yourself together, let's rock
Hit it, Run


I was straight from the start performing art
Climbing up the chart while others fall apart
The three outlaws in the music trade
We won't rob, but our job is to get paid (Paid)
'Cause Run has fun if Jay will play
As I add one more rhyme to say
Now, how devastating can an MC be?
My name is Darryl, but you can call me D
Hit it, Run


I was born son of Byford, brother of Al
Bannah's my mamma and Run's my pal
It's McDaniels, not McDonald's
These rhymes are Darryl's, the burgers are (Ronald's)
I ran down my family tree
My mother, my father, my brother, and D

(Now here's a little something that needs to be heard)
Uncle Ricky, could you read us a bedtime story?
Please, huh, please?
All right, you kids get to bed, I'll get the storybook
Y'all tucked in? Yeah
Here we go

Once upon a time not long ago
When people wore pajamas and lived life slow
When laws were stern and justice stood
And people were behavin' like they ought to good
There lived a little boy who was misled
By another little boy and this is what he said
""Me and you, tonight we're gonna make some cash
Robbin' old folks and makin' the dash""
They did the job, money came with ease
But one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease
He robbed another and another and a sister and a brother
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover
The cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic
He said, ""Keep still, boy, no need for static""
Punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap
But little did he know the little boy was strapped
The kid pulled out a gun, he said, ""Why'd you hit me?""
The barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure
""I'll do years if I pull this trigger""
So he cold dashed and ran around the block
Cop radios in to another lady cop
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister
Shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her
Looked 'round good and from expectations
So he decided he'd head for the subway stations
But she was coming and he made a left
He was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him (Sorry)
Then he made his move to an abandoned building
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor
Opened up the door there, guess who he saw? (Who?)
Dave, the dope fiend shootin' dope
Who don't know the meaning of water nor soap
He said, ""I need bullets, hurry up, run""
The dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun
He went outside but there was cops all over
Then he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova
Raced up the block doing eighty-three
Crashed into a tree near university
Escaped alive though the car was battered
Rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered
Ran out of bullets and he still had static
Grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic
Pointed at her head, he said the gun was full of lead
He told the cops, ""Back off or honey here is dead""
Deep in his heart he knew he was wrong
So he let the lady go and he starts to run on (Uh-huh)
Sirens sounded, he seemed astounded
And before long the little boy got surrounded
He dropped his gun, so went the glory
And this is the way I have to end this story
He was only seventeen, in a madman's dream
The cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream
This ain't funny so don't you dare laugh (Uh-huh)
Just another case about the wrong path (Uh-huh)
Straight and narrow or your soul gets cast

Check, check, check, check, check

Well, let us skip the boring foreplay, I'm slidin' right in
This girl over my house who had to be about 19
Ass, hoes in my poster
She's sweatin' although she tried to hold her composure
I hoped she'd take it in the ass and suck dick
My, my, what a nice apartment you got, Rick
On her knees about to make her fall too
All platinum and gold jammies hangin' on the wall too
You got it goin' on
Now my mouth start foamin'
The lights dim, we're kissin' and my hands start roamin' in her drawers
Stop
Knew she was joking
'Cause I ain't even fuck her and her pussy was soaking wet
Already had her tit out
If I play my cards right, fuck her, dig in the hole she shit out
Rick, I gotta go, my girl's waitin'
She recaps, finally when honey drawers down to her kneecaps
Breathed heavy, all mushy
Bitch swore up and down I was gonna fuck her in the pussy
Since friends waitin' on subtle
'Bout time to make a move upon the hungry little butt hole
Meanwhile, she acted quite passive
Lickin' the hun neck while lotionin' that ass with jelly
Tit hung out the frame, nigga loco
Surprised honey didn't put up too much of a struggle, at first
Sinkin' in she ain't know how to be
The bitch went
Ahh, Rick, it hurts, take it out of me
Knocked my magazine down, bitch threw my papers
You wanna keep it down? I mean, I do have neighbors
Squirmin' away although the table was barrin' her
Felt real good, my dick was sunk so far in her
She said it felt like a bulldozer boring her
Squealing about she couldn't take it anymore in her
My cummed on her straight in the perm in her, (Here)
As I drained every last drop of sperm in her (Where?)

So, girls, when we kiss and we cuddle
Ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butt hole

Another girl I met, her experience vast
Because most girls with kids done been hit in they ass before
Picked her up, sunset
Don't be late for dinner, ma
Bringin' honey home from the date at the cinema
Thinking how to fuck the ass so plottin'
Blown in the elevator, hit the stop button
She smiled, by knowing that her butt I wanna bore
I said, ""Can I have a kiss now instead of in front of your front door?""
Uhhmm, Oh yeah
Although The Ruler tried not to push hard
I'm all over the bitch like an octopus
Deep down I know she also wanna fuck
Though I kept my tongue in her mouth so not to put her on the spot
To have to talk no shit to prevent me from bonin'
Unzap the bra, when the hooker start moanin'
And expose my espresso, suck on her and lick on her
Unbucklin' pullin' out mad long dick on her
Panties in the way of that, but I want to check it out
Slipped her wet drawers down her thigh and took her leg out
Her butt was juicy, kinda fat
Spun around, start to stick her in the pussy from the back
She came, mad juice dripped out
Still in the pussy then acted like it slipped out
Cum on the floor, she said ""Pardon the puddle""
Spread open her cheeks, pushed hard in her butt hole
Uhhmm, wasn't a bad date at all, she went, ""Ahh, ahh""
Start pullin' at my balls while I'm still penetratin'
Felt fantastic, she said
""Rick, I'm not really into this ass kick""
Meanwhile, Rick cummin' by the gallon
Put your hands on the wall, please
And try and keep your balance
Lickin' the grill in her, meanwhile fillin' her
'Til sperm start pourin' out her butt hole while I'm still in her
Then start rammin' the pine in her
I almost picked her up with these final grinds in her
So, girls, when we kiss and we cuddle
Ain't no way to put it subtle when I want the butt hole

Help clean up this land

Just kidding, no offend to it, finally he ended it
Case dismissed, but your honor, D.A. kindly prevented it

Hey young world, the world is yours
Hey young world, the world is yours
Young world young world, the world is yours
Young world

This rap here, it may cause concern it's
Broad and deep, why don't you listen and learn
Love, peace, happiness, that once was strong
But due to society, even that's turned wrong
Times have changed, ayy, it's cool to look bummy
And be a dumb dummy and disrespect your mummy
Have you forgotten, who put you on this Earth?
Who brought you up right, and who loved you since your birth?
Reward is a brainwashed kid going wild
Young little girls already have a child
Bad company, hey, now you've been framed
Your parents are hurting, hurting and ashamed
You're ruining yourself, and your mommy can't cope
Hey, little kids don't follow these dopes
Here's a rule for the non fool, your life don't drool
Don't be a fool like those that don't go to school
Get ahead and accomplish things
You'll see the wonder and the joy life brings
Don't admire thieves 'cause, hey, they don't admire you
Their time's limited, hard rocks' too
So listen, be strong, scream whoopee-doo
Go for yours, 'cause dreams come true
And you'll make your mommy proud, so proud of you too

Hey Mr. Bigshot, hey, don't you look fly?
But you don't have a dollar, ohhhh, my my my
You've been fightin’ again and, you forgot why
Hey kid, walk straight, master your high
Why? Because you make your family cry
And all jokes aside, are you in good health?
Hey little boy, now have you really checked yourself?
You're a disgust, you know someone that I can't trust, you'd
Steal mom's welfare, and you'd run and buy some dust, and
Plus, I must say, big shot, you're not
Your friends are talking and I'm hearing that your girls are what?
You didn't know? Go steal and rob
And while you're at it, go get a suit for a job
You see you're actin like this urge is demanding
C'mon, wake up, have some understanding
Society's a weak excuse for a man
It's time for the brothers, it's time trying to take the stand
Believe it or not, the Lord still shines on you, he
Guides you, and he watched you as you grew, plus
Past the age of, a little child, that's true
But folks your age don't act like you do, so
So be mature, and put the point to a halt
And if you're over eighteen, I wish you'd act like an adult
Don't live in a world, of hate, hate, hate
Pull yourself together, and get yourself straight
Men don't steal, hey, most don't borrow
And if you smoke crack, your kids'll smoke crack tomorrow
So be more mature, and kids do your chores
Make your own money, hey, be proud that's yours
You know why, 'cause that's a man, that's brains, no spite
Stayin out of trouble, when it comes in sight
And a man never loses a fight, in God's sight
'Cause righteous laws are overdue
And this is a message that the Ruler Rick threw

Davy, Davy Crockett, King of the Wild Frontier

Well he's in Indian Town and what spots his eye?
A nice looking Indian and honey looked fly
He had to talk because he just couldn't hack it
She wore some moccasins and plus a tough leather jacket
He trotted over and invented a line
He said ""Excuse me, um, do you happen to have the time?""
All was on his mind was sex, sex, sex
So she said, ""Why do ask? You got your own Timex""
To poor old Dave that line was cold blooded
It seemed like her ego was way over flooded
She started to laugh and then she started to say
""I'm sorry some times I do get carried away
I didn't mean to like ill treat you
My name is Running Rabbit and I'm glad to meet you""
He said, ""I'm Dave, with crazy clout""
She said ""Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about
Yeah, you must be, because you look like a winner
Come to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner""

Well, he met her father, Big Chief Beretti
He said ""What's for dinner?"" ""Soup and spaghetti""
The dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it
He never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it
Later on they was chilling in the bedroom
Sitting by the window looking on the Moon
Nothing was being said so he swore she was hot
He said ""Are you in the mood?"" She said ""No I'm not""
From what he believes and from what he guessed
If a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes
So, he started touching her and coming out strong
Whispering sweet nothings and singing a song
He said: (singing) ""I'm in the mood for love
Simply because you're near me
Funny but when you're near me
I'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude
But I'm in the mood for love""
And the she said ""Oh Dave, you've got my poor back hurting
I want you, first close the curtain""
He closed the curtain and also the doors
The next thing you knew it was off with those drawers
""Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. Stop""

Well, he was playing with her titties, they were soft not lumpy
And then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty
He's fucking, sucking, also finger popping
He had no intention of stopping
Crazy fun, he did not want to leave
His head was between her tits and he could barely breathe
He had to toss, turn, turn, toss
Meanwhile he was riding her with crazy force
She was burning hot, she said ""Stop, stop.""
He said, ""Are you talking sex or what?""
I guess she didn't realize what she started
Next thing you know she was acting retarded
She said to him strangely and kind of merry
""Stop now, or I'll be unordinary""
He didn't take her warning
He rode her till the morning
He rode that ass till the pussy started yawning
*Yawning sounds*
He said ""What? Wait"" His dick went weak
It said ""Dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak""
He took off his clothes he wanted to leave this place
But first he wanted to see the vagina face to face
He opened it up, with his bare two thumbs
He seen crabs with spears and Indian drums!

Ladies, and gentlemen, and lowlifes
It is with outstanding pleasure that we are here to present tonight
Slick Rick, the Ruler! And MC Ricky D!
Doing their smash hit, ""Mona Lisa,"" you know, like the picture?
Anyway, I'd like to take this time out to bow before his divine majesty
Oh, your majesty?
Hmm
Can I kiss your hand?
Mm-hmm
*Kisses*
Enough!
Come your highness, they await you

Well, it was one of those days, not much to do
I was chillin' downtown with my old school crew
I went into a store to buy a slice of pizza
And bumped into a girl, her name was Mona—what?
Mona Lisa (What?), Mona Lisa, so men named you
You know what I'm sayin'? So I said
""Excuse me, dear, my gosh, you look nice!
Put away your money, I'll buy that slice!""
She said, ""Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you
I'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you""
The compliment showed she had a mind in her
And when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her
She said, ""Great Scott! Are you a thief?
Seems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth""
Ha-ha, hah! Had to find that funny
So I said, ""No child, I work hard for the money
And calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)
Sit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet""
She almost got cut short -- you know, scissored
She tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard
Me! ""Well what's your name, son?""
""MC Ricky D,"" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee
""I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uhh, yeah)
Please sit, and tell me a little about your past""
She said, ""Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)
I've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)
Over eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)
I wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)
Trim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned
Best believe Mona's a virgin""
A virgin?! Honey needed a slap
She tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yay wide gap
I said, ""It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)
Let me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky:
R - ravishing
I - impress
C - courageous or careless
K - for the Kangols which I've got
That I wear everyday and Y -- Why not?
To fight's not right that I recite and I'm..
Quite polite like Walter Cronkite""
Well, just about then, Trevor my friend came in
He said, ""Hey Rick, don't you know playing with these snakes is a sin?!?""
He grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store
He said, ""I don't want to see you playing with these lowlifes no more!
Now come along, we have a party to attend
With some real mature women and some more of our friends""
He hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute
And as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!
And as we were leaving and driving along
I could hear a melody as Mona sang a song

And I start to cry each time we meet

Here's an oldie but goodie
Hit it

Excuse me (what?) Can I have your attention? (mhm-hmm)
There's just a few things that I've got to mention (mhm-hmm)
There's girlies out here that seem appealing
But they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings
I'm telling you, as Rick is my name
I wouldn't trust no girl unless she feels the same

Treat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my first example

Now ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while
Plans for the future, she's having your child
Celebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts
Telling all your friends about your family thoughts
One friend was drunk so he starts to act wild
He tells the truth about the kid, ""It's not your child""
Acting like a jerk and on his face was a smirk
He said, ""Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work""
And she led him on and tried to please him
She didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him
You might also like
Treat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my second example

Now your wife, you buy the tramp jewels and clothes
You get sentimental and bring home a rose
Give her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it
All your friends tell you ""The bitch don't deserve it""
Love is blind, so there goes your wealth
Until one day, you see things for yourself
Came home from work early Mr. Loverman
You had a card and some candy in your right hand
There's the mailman, he was short yet stout
He went inside your house and didn't come back out, bust it
Just a friendly stop, come on, is it?
The mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?
The thought alone makes your temperature boil
You say to yourself ""She might still be loyal""
You open up your door and stand in a trance
You see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants
Came home to party, at work had a hard day
Look around your house and you say ""Where the hell are they?""
Run upstairs up to your bedroom
You look inside your room, you see something brewin'
Cover your mouth because you almost choke
You see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat
Treat 'em like a prostitute (mhm-hmm)
Don't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop
'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample
Listen up close, here comes my last example

Now your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot
And today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot
As you open up the door she says ""Get on the floor""
She wants to try things she's never tried before
She takes off your drawers and works you over
She calls you Twinkles and you call her Rover
Next thing you know the ho starts to ill
She says ""I love you, Harold"" and your name is Will
That's not the half 'til you start to ride her
Take off your rubber and there's one more inside her
It's not yours - who can it be?
I think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky

Treat 'em like a prostitute
Don't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well
Treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop4Embed",https://images.genius.com/5f4d75aded5ef0d74dba14238567f9f2.750x750x1.jpg

And everything seems so great at the start
For she loves him, and he also loves her
And it's hard to turn back to who the person you were
But later on, problems start to occur
And the bond, which combines y'all turn into a blur
For the feelings were the same, now here's the score
You love 'em too much, and they don't love you anymore

But no, you'd rather go with this dead relationship
Hanging around, and buying him stuff
You seem him every darn day, you don't see him enough
You follow them around, and they claim ya hawking
When conversation comes, you do all the talking
Not to mention, attention, we all need a bit
Behind your back they're saying, yeah he's all on my...
They're getting sick of you, and quite annoyed
And if you had plans for the future, they're now destroyed
You saw what was happening, and you still let it
And if you ever let him make love to ya girl, you can forget it
Sweetheart, you been caught
It'll spread around town faster than ya thought
And break up time, and you receive the words
Yo, this is from the heart, and I know the part hurts
Get over it, from now don't take short slick
If it's not true love, you shouldn't deal with it
Just think of your future, and what is to come
And pay attention to the words that's in this song, they go

""Halt, who goes yonder?""
""It is I, sire, Richard of Nottingham""
""Well, speak up man, what is it?""
""News from the east, sire, Rick the Ruler has returned!""
Scratches: Stop Lyin'!

Gather 'round party goers as if you're still livin'
And get on down to the old Slick rhythm
Now this one here is called the Ruler my dear
It's a mere party booster that will set things clear
It's a hundred percent proof from champions of truth
And if you feel you need spirit I'll bring back your youth
Relax your mind, and folks unwind
And be kind to a rhythm that you hardly find
And off we go, let the trumpets blow
Well hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back
Scratches: Hit it!

Now in these times, well, at least to me
There's a lot of people out here tryin' to sound like Ricky D
Not tryin' to cause trouble cause it's really a small thing
But they're bitin' what I'm writin'
God it's great being the king
Some sound alright, but then they act illy
Try conquering my crown and that's really very silly
Now I'm not the type that gets upset
Try to disrespect folks just to earn respect
But learn this fact, whether white or black
I can't get conquered in my style of rap
For jealousy and envy are dumb ones' tools
So Ricky says nothing, he keeps his cool
Revenge is not a mission that the Ruler's on
Just forgiveness required for the wrong that's done
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on, because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Now one day when I was chillin' at this outside jam
I seen folks havin' a ball and plus clappin' their hands
To beats of records that conquer the streets
Like Pee Wee Herman and Clubhouse Treats
Girls was chillin', boys rule as usual
The slacks, the golds, the rings, I hope I'm not confusin' y'all
But everyone in the house looks smashin'
Fresh clothes on their butts and nothing out of fashion
And just when you thought nothing couldn't get better
A news flash concealed in a bright yellow letter
A kid ran up to the mike and said ""Alert, hear this,""
Cleared his crummy throat and then began to persist
He said ""Hallelujah, kids hear this
The Ruler's back and he's here to assist""
So off we go, let the trumpets blow
And hold on because the driver of the mission is a pro
The Ruler's back

Well I've been a public figure for quite a long time
Known to the whole world for what? my style of rhyme
But tonight let's talk about the ones who bite
Although they know they won't never get it right
Because they have no class and they have no shame
They'll bite another brother to boost their own name
Get paid correct on a one way gimmick
I'm happy for you lowlifes but 'member there's a limit - so say

Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks kinda easy like there was nuttin' to it
But they don't understand that the master will be
The creator of the style (Ricky D)
Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so easy like there was nuttin' to it
But they don't understand that the master will be
The creator of the style (Ricky D)

When I walk into a party coke snorters laugh
As the girls be crazy coming for my mere autograph
And it seems that they admiring my new style of rappin'
And brothers all around me out of vanity, they're snapping
The girls say, ""Wow, Rick you're so unique
Please tell us how you organize the words you speak""'
But my will says chill and I go upon my way
Cause class will be taught some other day - so say

Well I remember one night when the world was dead quiet
And out of nowhere some boy starts a riot
He tore my clothes, I had to throw blows
A shotgun barrel was dead on my nose
I froze - it was Big Foot and the Toes
Yup, a bunch of small timers that be at all my shows
Surrounded the ruler with machetes too
They said um, ""If you don't teach us how to rap you're through""
I said 'okay, now let me go, please'
I seen an officer - then the officer screamed 'freeze!'
He said, ""Slick Rick you okay?""
I had to play it off, some girls were looking my way
So I smacked one in the face and told him, ""I won't retire
And many years from now I'll just be getting higher""
For I am the master, said and done
My name is Ricky D and I'm the only one - so say
(Ricky D)
(Ricky D)

Now when I was a lad my style was bad
So I had to use what little bit of knowledge that I had
So I quote and I wrote 'till I was up to par
Some rhymes were  and some rhymes were 
I educate myself so I'm able to reach ya
Answering the call of teacher, teacher
Tell us how you do it, it's so easy for me
The creator of the style, MC Ricky D
Now my only task is to warn all biters
Slimy sluts and fake rhyme writers
Don't try your luck and get the ruler annoyed
For when I'm through with you boy your whole world will be destroyed
So chill mister muscle or I'll come and hunt ya
If you are a girl I'll make no man want ya
So if you wanna rule and no pride's in the way
Pay attention to my syllables and come see me and say, ""Hey hey""

Teacher, teacher, tell me how you do it
It looks so easy like there was nuttin' to it

Well I'm sittin on my lunch break, grinnin my teeth (my teeth)
It's the last day of the week, boy what a relief (relief)
My muscles kind of ache, they felt rigid and stiff
So I looked around, and I smoked this big fat spliff
Now I'm happy as can be I'm in this pothead spell
I put some Visine in my eyes so that no one can tell
It's 12:55 almost time for the bell
Put the breathmints in the mouth so that the mouth don't smell
Now back on the job, I don't bother no one
I keep strictly to myself and all my work gets done
Now the job's finally over it's time to have fun
And I'm hangin out with Trevor there's a kid named John
Got real drunker than a skunk and happy as can be
We went, to the Latin Quarters and we got in free
Scoopin all the girls like nuttin with my truck jewelry
Cause I'mma fly brown brother and you can't school me
Boogie Down was performin hey they ain't no joke
And a bunch of Brooklyn kids was lookin all down my throat
Was it my big chains with the big plates on em?
Then they rolled on me and told me to run em

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo homeboy take off your chains man
Bout to hurt you real fuckin bad, I'm gonna fuck you up""
This was the moment I feared...
""Yo what's the matter stupid? Take the shits off man!
The fuck is up?""

I said, ""They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls""
Then a whole bunch of furious fists caved my world
I was in pain, so ashamed, I wish I had not came
Had to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then
I went to an open store that's where I bought me a quart
Then I went to the park, and I sat and I thought
I seen Danny Boy though he's with his girl named Sarah
In one of his cars, I think this one's a Riviera
She calls out to me, but, I really couldn't hear her
So I went just a little bit closer so I'd hear a little clearer
She said, ""I need Veronica Place that's right near Tilden""
I said, ""I know where that's at cause that's right next to my building""
I gave em the information and they went on their way
I went home, and there I slept til almost three the next day
Then someone knocked on my door, I opened up, no quit!
It was Sarah with some magazines and a band-aid kit
She tried to use me and seduce me and at first I wasn't with it
Then we did it and we did it and we did it and WE DID IT
She said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it
The elevator came and Danny Boy was on it

This was the moment I feared...
""Hey yo what the fuck's goin on here?
What you doin to my girl homeboy?""
This was the moment I feared...
""Oh I just KNOW y'all didn't just finish fuckin
I just KNOW y'all ain't just finish fuckin""
Well he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word
So I pulled out my jammy and I silenced the nerd
Then he was dead two in the head I took the cash and the Visa's
She said, ""Don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us""
We went back to her apartment, there was blow in the freezers
She said, ""We're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us""
Now I don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health
So I put the sugarhead out and I went for self
Now I was rich as I was rich I could have whatever would please me
Now I could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me
Yah me, I'll be a new neighborhood dad
Cats'll roll up on me screamin, ""Yo Rick my man!!""
I guess I was too fly word up I'm sorry to say
Ya see a cop rolled up on me and told me, ""Make my day""
I said, ""Relax brother,"" but he had proof that I had done it
Yep, he had poor Sarah's underwear with my fingerprints all on it
This was the rise and fall of my fast lane style
And I was the main event on the TV for a while
But now I'm in jail doin life and I'm scared
Some kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared

Wasn't havin' any pity, now in Razor Blade City
Cry, suppose the situation seen mad eyes of foes
Drives a Rolls, ""Hey, yo, money, what size are those?""
Need to phone me to another sprang up, hm, to gang up
On this kid housin' the phone like he didn't know how to hang up
Would be hard, though, up to a minute or so and then yells, ""Time on""
""And when you get your commissary, buy this and that or else I'm gonna""
Be on that ass and won't stay off, extort, fig I save, way off
Beaten to death, you ain't protectin' me, forgot today's my day off
Hold my head and drift the Sumo weight in knots and cars
Instead of sittin' here accumulatin' cuts and scars behind bars

If a riot jumped off, it's time for incision
Stickin' niggas here and stickin' niggas there
I turned around and looked and seen cops everywhere
Jackin' brothers up, slappin' brothers up
If you got blood on yo' clothes, lock up!
High-powered was the level, level fo'
Niggas sentenced to life and you can't be no hoe (biaatch!)

What fight? The nigga trip, C.O. the rest he might scared
But couldn't squeal, I's like, ""Officer, that nigga right there""
Now, if he ain't get me his friend's will, needed a utensil
It turned out, I had to stab him in the eye wit a pencil
State of shock, he made a yell, I said, ""Huh, what you want, traitor?""
""C.O. puts me in the bin"", I'll say about a month later
Back in population, didn't matter that his friends tensed
The phone prints, the years added to the sentence
Still chillin' and all of that and I escaped when I didn't think
So, don't hit the sto' because they made a rape attempt
Thank goodness, failed, called out next, he wailed out
Here go the C.O., ""Ricky Walters, pack up, you're bailed out""
The C.O. couldn't see the rape, the kid'll snitch mass figure
Fast trigger, you'll be back, you little bitch ass nigga

Something tells Rick he's a fool
To let girls treat me so cruel
But never-the-less, Rick said ""You got me waiting""
Sitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala

I got a girl, but I'm about to switch all that
Because my girl be trying to play me like the bitch all that
Shoot, clocked her daughter, for acting out of order
To impress a girl who to me knocked her out the water!
But because the kid swears love
Though when I see her friend it's like the shit wears off
I don't bother, while she want to kiss and then cuss and full of hate
Get her friend? Mission Impossible
Because she's the one the hon chose to boast to
The way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste
So make music in my basement
Don't cut her off until I find a good replacement
One day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's
House, cause the hon was sleeping over
My girl was acting fine, then the slime switched
Wanna diss, I said ""It's over, you waste of time bitch""
Tried to kiss her friend, twice then a third
She said ""Stop, Rick"", but didn't tell her friend a word
I went to bed, here come my girl touching me tenderly
Snuck out later, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before
Because she swore a nigga hit her
""Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?""
But I didn't (no you ain't), now the hon badgering
I don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair

I said ""Being straight up, you I really wanted""
Though she fucked niggas with money like mad
Still found myself wanting the honey quite bad
Loyal to her friend, though she knew she wanted wood
Then we did it, boy that pussy was good
""But what if shorty finds out?"" Never be too clever
""Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together""
Chill, then we started to button the strap and
When my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened
Later on, my girlfriend stormed in
""We going to the supper club, some kid's performing
Bye, see you later""
Her girlfriend hot, let me see how they livin', Rick decide to follow
I'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can
Both sluts were sliding numbers to the next man
Contradicting of words being together
My girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather
Back in my Jeep, about 4:11
Popped another can, looked up to the heavens
I'm a good man, in fact I know that I am
And I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm
Sitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala

You're kinda late ""Flat tire"" Well that do occur
Well alright, pay me now, and you'll be after her

Now you know the title of this, so start licking it
Lips kicking it, hey bitch, there is a brick in it
So when you think you're prepared, I keep sticking it
Now here they come with a spike to fight, take it light

1994, as the world gets trifer
I'm wondering, fuck I need a woman in my life for?
Ya know, cause it's like a nigga whole history
With you hoes been nothing but misery
First rater, five-one stood
Mad coke fiend though the bitch looked good
Met her at the Fever, ""What's going on, stranger?""
And like a fool took her in and tried to change her
I don't who I thought I's bluffing
That bitch wasn't giving up that coke for nothing
""Oh you tryna dis, mister bougeois nigga
Yet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too
That type shit you ain't admitting""
Because, home girl, I grew out of it, you didn't
Anyway, dead outta order
Came in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her
Who gave you that? ""My ex"" I said ""Who?""
Believe she had the nerve to say ""You can wear it too""
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new

Then I met Syb, sweating the viking
A brown skinned fox, slim just like I like 'em
""What? Sweating you? Picture that, nerd.. please""
Anyway, the bitch had herpes!
You know, imagine me, the fool being the spouse
Doctor said I couldn't catch it 'less I got aroused
Found out snooping in her bag what she got
Now why you ain't tell me? You worthless slut!
""Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to""
You know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying
Anyway, stayed with the creep
One day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep
""Chris, wait,"" the bum bitch said
So loud 'til a mothafucka fell out the bed
Who the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance
'til I caught her calling the nigga long distance
Had the nerve to dispatch loving
Boy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing
When I found strength to depart, I do
Withdrew, for something brand new
Someone who would be true
Yes, I should find someone who would be true
Cause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true
Indeed, I need a love that's true
It seems I need a love that's true
Oh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo
Oh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo

Though happy I was free, the need for love was still in me
Got to the point like the need for it was killing me
Then I met shorty here, hanging with my cousin
Found out later how young the bitch was and
Though I done hit it and she opened up a world
And remind me of that song ""Go Away, Little Girl""
It had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled
""That's because I had you pussy whipped royal""
You see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?
You see the type of attitude the bum bitch carry?
Like oil and water, impossible mixture
Then temper tantrums came into the picture
Yelling, carrying on bad and cursing
Complete embarassment to the Ruler as a person
""Gimme shorts"" Ruler will not permit you
Then she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture
Flirts too, excuse me, a whore
Like the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour

Can't believe how many times I had to eat the chick's sushi
Who she?
Look at how a brother gotta roll
All cold, kid
Anyway truth being told
Fit boy too, big
Which one you pick
Rico suave or chick one, two kid
Once I was born in this thick
Why I gotta deal with this horniness tip
This, not enough flair
This, lack lot wares
Got her holding my tears, trying to act like who cares
You might also likeReaching, if I say I see kids in the mix
Wanna cuddle, go out something, trick with the chick
Motivate through it though I know it ain't true
Why argue, tell a chick ""You're okay too""
Delilah
Though I flirt too beside her
Easy to play dumb while your IQ is higher
Why ya, you treat me like a sucker
I don't know should I keep maneuvering to knock her?
To what, something sexual, puppy
Anything to get into this shallow chick's body
(Know what I'm saying kid)
Cause it bad, trying to drive me a sane man mad
(Say what my kid)
I needs some bad about to drive me a sane man mad
(Bring it on kid)
Good Gosh the world so bad, trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Bring me home kid)
Great Gosh need some bad, about to drive me a sane man...
I want you, munch too, comes to hun, how long do
Ma duke caught the kid masturbating once too
(no)
Passed, looked stunned, kept on like
Don't you have a steady piece to smash yet son?
What to do Mom, none touching dude's joint
Like to see me out here buying some prostitute's bum?
No?
Picking up scroin, cop pursuing
From the stripper club hairdoing
Then laughed and none but wise after
Soulmate, more than sex, a live partner
Snatch can't get, cat frantic
So, in the meantime stripper club, lap dance tip
A professional press box arouser
Some condoms so I don't mess up me trousers
Then start paying, mark swaying
Girlfriend just sit down and start playing
Here's an extra, parading the wealth
Don't want a real kid feel like I'm degrading myself
Bouncing on me funny, bouncing with my money
Or its back to playing cat and mouse games with the honey
(You know what I mean kid)
Caught a script so bad, trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Say what Slick Rick)
I need some bad 'bout to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Premier)
Good gosh the world so bad trying to drive me, a sane man, mad
(Jonah Hill kid)
Good gosh, need some bad, about to drive me a sane man...

Well, I'mma tell you a story and I come out bluntly
Born an ugly child; hey, nobody would want me
I used to walk around and get upset and upsetter
Till I figured out ways to make myself look better
As I got older, my awareness expanded
I met this beautiful girl and my wish was commanded
Didn't hang wit fellas cause they started gettin shady
I'd always be wit my girl and ya could call her my lady
I loved her a lot, word up, not going to front, see?
The problem that arose is why on earth did she want me?
Couldn't figure it out, and to make things worst
I was cursed, wit the torment of not being the first
And the first was this fly guy, made me very jealous
Always think she'd cheat on me and talk to other fellas
Two wrongs don't make a right, but any time that we fight
I would call and took a phone and call a girl outta spite
I shouldn't have done it

I'm feelin sad and blue

I will to make this right, so director was admirin
I tried to stop my love, but no love was not retirin
To catch her in a lie was near impossible and tricky
Didn't want her in certain clothes, gettin really picky
We got into it again, this time she got to bright
So me preventin a fight, I just stayed out for the night
I had to ease up of the record, all this hot increase
I went up to the Parrot, with Omega, Vance, and Dane
This girl came over, she was trucked down extensive
Startin talkin to me, and she was probably quite aggresive
A pretty young thing, she didn't strike me as no ho
So meet my nigga, rude and went on wit the flow
But Joe was gettin hard, without me even knowin
We stepped up back to my van and I could it's for growin
The girl took off her coat her body was no joke
Well, I rubbed it to unzip it, and I went for broke
I shouldn't have done it
You might also like

Now I’ve sinned and there's no one to blame
That night when I went home, I felt real guilty and ashamed
Snucked right into bed, I felt just like a shady fella
What made me so unsensitive, how I'm ever gonna tell her?
Shouldn't have cheated, just because we'd always doubt
Endurance, be a man, that's what I had to learn about
How me, I guess I like the wanted secrets that I did
I figure, I'd patch things up and then I'll tell what I did
Then after that, she started actin heaven sent
I found a house spot, let's say she help out wit the rent
So, I bought the ring, it was a good 20 Karat
Then word got back about me chillin at the parrot
So when I got home, I thought she'd just be out to roast
Instead I found this letter, and I found her overdosed
It said ""I had it for you but I guess you didn't care""
All this wouldn't happen come of me and this fear
I shouldn't have done it

Yeah, know what I mean Rick?
Know what I mean Rick?
Know what I mean Slick, Whoa!
Yeah, wee!

Fine, grown Pine-Sol, heavenly rhyme throne
Remember when you were young in the '70 time zone?
Stages, age is 'bout seven, I say, kids
The dress code of our parents looked awfully outrageous
Not down on 'em, games and clownin'
When soul was at its highest rate like James Brown and them
Soothin' every black thing, a groovy era actin'
'Member seein' Shaft in the movie theater back then?
I feel Richard Roundtree got 'em a fly deal
Black men wearin' bell bottom and high heels
Laughed a lot, some action, mass production
Remember when cars were darn near half a block long?
Parents were so into that crap
Bunch of sweet memories to us older rap cats
Muhammad Ali knucklin' in tournament
Pimp daddy hats with buckles and ornaments
How we forget Snappy?
Five people sleepin' in one mattress and yet happy
You might also like
Could even make sex seem sour
As I impress the world with my extreme power
'Cause Rick make memories sealed in almanacs
Not to mention the immense appeal the mack had
When you wake up in the mornin' (redeem from any crap)
Because I bring that lovin' feelin' back to rap

For situated as poor beneficialator
Kool-Aid couldn't last a hot minute in the refrigerator
School notes, slidin' and stealin', hidin 'em
Bazooka, bubble gum cartoons still inside of 'em
No way, same essence of it's earned paper
Pimps flyest dressin' muthafuckas, weren't they?
But hood lies, you afraid of a good wine?
I used to love the actor who portrayed one on Good Times
You need a friend to warn a soul, man, it kinda slow
One thing 'bout it bro, overflow when it's kinda so (shame)
Life, a pitiful game
'Member the robot? That was my shit on Soul Train
Got hyped too, psyched too and the feelin's right too
Chillin' on the fire escape on a nice night, too
No one gone try hurt di mon
Remember Right On, Blood and Jive Turkey slang?
Brothers chippin' in for alcoholic money
When you look at old flicks don't we all look funny?

Yo' mama, damn, we used to talk improper then
'Member when we used to walk bop, walk bop again?
Givin' them the rhythm that we brought
Push our hand back like we was swimmin' when we walked
Bad all about, Huggie Bear, Rat all about
'Member afros, what the fuck was that all about?
Buenos noches accents too, friends too
Everybody had a lot of roaches back then, too
Profusely around us, Lucy Afarensis
Fleets wearing Bruce Lee Bananas
And kick shit, ball in the hand and stick with
And we use to be in some of the ""Man, you in deep shit""
Most cases, father away for good
Local Flat Foot was part-of the neighborhood
Standard, and the panthers (Wow)
Used to dress like Erykah Badu and Amanda's now

We keep on comin' while we runnin' for your jewels
Steady gunnin', keep on bustin' at them fools, you know the rules
Lil' Caesar, go ask your homie how I'll leave ya
Cut your young-ass up, leave you in pieces, now be deceased
Lil' Kim, don't fuck around with real G's
Quick to snatch yo' ugly ass off the streets, so fuck peace!
I'll let them niggas know it's on for life
Don't let the Westside ride tonight (Hahaha)

Biggie Smalls just got dropped

Frank White needs to get spanked right for settin' traps
Little accident murderer, and I ain't never heard of ya
Poisonous gats attack when I'm servin' ya
Spank ya, shank ya whole style when I gank
Guard your rank 'cause I'ma slam your ass in the paint
Puffy weaker than the fuckin' block I'm runnin' through, nigga
And I'm smokin' Junior M.A.F.I.A. in front of you, nigga
With the ready power tucked in my Guess under my Eddie Bauer
Your clout petty/sour, I push packages every hour; I hit 'em up!
Grab your Glocks when you see 2Pac

Who shot me? But you punks didn't finish
Now you 'bout to feel the wrath of a menace
Nigga, we hit 'em up!

Peep how we do it, keep it real as penitentiary steel
This ain't no freestyle battle
All you niggas gettin' killed with your mouths open
Tryna come up off of me, you in the clouds hopin'
Smokin' dope, it's like a sherm high
Niggas think they learned to fly
But they burn, mothafucka, you deserve to die
Talkin' about you gettin' money, but it's funny to me
All you niggas livin' bummy while you fuckin' with me
I'm a self-made millionaire
Thug livin', out of prison, pistols in the air (Haha)
Biggie, remember when I used to let you sleep on the couch
And beg a bitch to let you sleep in the house?
Now it's all about Versace, you copied my style
Five shots couldn't drop me, I took it and smiled
Now I'm back to set the record straight
With my AK, I'm still the thug that you love to hate
Mothafucka, I hit 'em up!
I'm from N-E-W Jers' where plenty of murders occurs
No points or commas, we bring the drama to all you herbs
Now go check the scenario: Little Cease
I'll bring you fake G's to your knees, coppin' pleas in de Janeiro
Little Kim, is you coked up or doped up?
Get your little Junior Whopper click smoked up
What the fuck, is you stupid?
I take money, crash and mash through Brooklyn
With my click lootin', shootin' and pollutin' your block
With a 15-shot cocked Glock to your knot
Outlaw MAFIA clique movin' up another notch
And your pop stars popped and get mopped and dropped
All your fake-ass East Coast props brainstormed and locked

You's a beat biter, a Pac style taker
I'll tell you to your face, you ain't shit but a faker
Softer than Alizé with a chaser
'Bout to get murdered for the paper
E.D.I. Mean approach the scene of the caper
Like a loc, with Lil' Caesar in a choke
Gun totin' smoke, we ain't no motherfuckin' joke
Thug Life, niggas better be knowin'
We approachin' in the wide open, gun smokin'
No need for hopin', it's a battle lost
I got 'em crossed as soon as the funk is boppin' off
Nigga, I hit 'em up!

Now you tell me who won
I see them, they run, hahahaha

Whole Junior M.A.F.I.A. clique dressin' up tryna be us (Take money)

Ooh, yeah (Ooh)
(Come on, come on)

I see no changes, wake up in the morning and I ask myself
Is life worth livin'? Should I blast myself?
I'm tired of bein' poor and, even worse, I'm black
My stomach hurts so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch
Cops give a damn about a negro
Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero
""Give the crack to the kids, who the hell cares?
One less hungry mouth on the welfare""
First ship 'em dope and let 'em deal to brothers
Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other
""It's time to fight back,"" that's what Huey said
Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead
I got love for my brother
But we can never go nowhere unless we share with each other
We gotta start makin' changes
Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers
And that's how it's supposed to be
How can the Devil take a brother if he's close to me? Uh
I'd love to go back to when we played as kids
But things change, and that's the way it is

That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Come on, come on)
I see no changes, all I see is racist faces
Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races
We under, I wonder what it takes to make this
One better place, let's erase the wasted
Take the evil out the people, they'll be actin' right
'Cause both black and white are smokin' crack tonight
And the only time we chill is when we kill each other (Kill each other)
It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other
And although it seems heaven-sent
We ain't ready to see a black president, uh (Oh-ooh)
It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact
The penitentiary's packed and it's filled with blacks
But some things will never change (Never change)
Try to show another way, but you stayin' in the dope game (Ooh)
Now tell me, what's a mother to do?
Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you (Yeah)
You gotta operate the easy way
""I made a G today,"" but you made it in a sleazy way
Sellin' crack to the kids (Oh-oh), ""I gotta get paid"" (Oh)
Well hey, well that's the way it is

That's just the way it is (Way it is)
Aww, yeah (Aww, yeah, aww, yeah)

We gotta make a change
It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes
Let's change the way we eat
Let's change the way we live
And let's change the way we treat each other
You see, the old way wasn't workin'
So it's on us to do what we gotta do to survive

And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace?
It's war on the streets and the war in the Middle East (Ooh, yeah)
Instead of war on poverty
They got a war on drugs so the police can bother me
And I ain't never did a crime I ain't have to do
But now I'm back with the facts, givin' it back to you (Ooh)
Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up
Crack you up and pimp-smack you up
You gotta learn to hold your own
They get jealous when they see you with your mobile phone
But tell the cops they can't touch this
I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this
That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool
My mama didn't raise no fool (Oh)
And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped
And I never get to lay back
'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the payback
Some buck that I roughed up way back
Comin' back after all these years
""Rat-a-tat-tat-tat-tat,"" that's the way it is
(Uh)

2Pac cares if don't nobody else care (Oh)
And, uh, I know they like to beat you down a lot
When you come around the block, brothers clown a lot
But please don't cry, dry your eyes, never let up
Forgive, but don't forget, girl, keep ya head up
And when he tells you you ain't nothin', don't believe him
And if he can't learn to love you, you should leave him
'Cause, sister, you don't need him
And I ain't tryin' to gas you up, I just call 'em how I see 'em (You don't need him)
You know what makes me unhappy? (What's that?)
When brothers make babies
And leave a young mother to be a pappy (Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And since we all came from a woman
Got our name from a woman and our game from a woman (Yeah, yeah)
I wonder why we take from our women
Why we rape our women, do we hate our women?
(Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?)
I think it's time to kill for our women
Time to heal our women, be real to our women
And if we don't, we'll have a race of babies
That will hate the ladies that make the babies (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And since a man can't make one
He has no right to tell a woman when and where to create one

Ayo, I remember Marvin Gaye used to sing to me
He had me feelin' like black was the thing to be
And suddenly the ghetto didn't seem so tough
And though we had it rough, we always had enough
I huffed and puffed about my curfew and broke the rules
Ran with the local crew and had a smoke or two
I realize Mama really paid the price
She nearly gave her life to raise me right (Oh, yeah-yeah)
And all I had to give her was my pipe dream
Of how I'd rock the mic and make it to the bright screen
I'm tryin' to make a dollar out of fifteen cents
It's hard to be legit and still pay your rent
And in the end, it seems I'm headin' for the pen'
I try to find my friends, but they're blowin' in the wind
Last night, my buddy lost his whole family
It's gonna take the man in me to conquer this insanity (Oh, no, no, no)
It seems the rain'll never let up
I try to keep my head up and still keep from gettin' wet up, huh
You know, it's funny, when it rains it pours
They got money for wars, but can't feed the poor
Said it ain't no hope for the youth
And the truth is it ain't no hope for the future
And then they wonder why we crazy, huh
I blame my mother for turnin' my brother into a crack baby
We ain't meant to survive 'cause it's a set-up
And even though you're fed up, huh, you got to keep ya head up

And, uh, to all the ladies havin' babies on they own
I know it's kinda rough and you're feelin' all alone
Daddy's long gone and he left you by your lonesome
Thank the Lord for my kids even if nobody else want 'em
'Cause I think we can make it, in fact, I'm sure
And if you fall, stand tall and come back for more (Oh-oh)
'Cause ain't nothin' worse than when your son
Wants to know why his daddy don't love him no mo'
You can't complain, you was dealt this hell of a hand
Without a man, feelin' helpless (I know you were)
Because there's too many things for you to deal with
Dyin' inside, but outside you're lookin' fearless
While the tears is rollin' down your cheeks
You're steady hopin' things don't all fall this week (Yeah)
'Cause if it did, you couldn't take it (Yeah)
And don't blame me, I was given this world, I didn't make it (Oh, yeah)
And now my son's gettin' older and older
And cold from havin' the world on his shoulders

Peeped the weakness in the rap game and sewed it
Bow down, pray to God, hopin' that he's listenin'
Seein' niggas comin' for me through my diamonds when they glistenin'
Now pay attention: bless me please, Father, I'm a ghost
In these killing fields, Hail Mary, catch me if I go
Let's go deep inside the solitary mind of a madman
Screams in the dark, evil lurks, enemies see me flee
Activate my hate, let it break to the flame
Set trip, empty out my clip, never stop to aim
Some say the game is all corrupt and fucked in this shit
Stuck, niggas is lucky if we bust out this shit
Plus, Mama told me never stop until I bust a nut
Fuck the world if they can't adjust, it's just as well, Hail Mary

Penitentiaries is packed with promise-makers
Never realized the precious time that bitch niggas is wastin'
Institutionalized, I live my life a product made to crumble
Much too hardened for a smile, way too crazy to be humble
We ballin', catch me, Father, please
‘Cause I'm fallin' in the liquor store
Pass the Hennessy, I hear you callin', can I get some more?
Bail 'til I reach Hell, I ain't scared
Mama checkin' in my bedroom, I ain't there
I got a head with no screws in it, what can I do?
One life to live, but I got nothin' to lose
Just me and you on a one-way trip to prison, sellin' drugs
We all wrapped up in this livin', life as thugs
To my homeboys in Clinton Max doin' their bid
Raise hell to this real shit and feel this
When they turn out the lights, I'll be there in the dark
Thuggin' eternal through my heart
Now hail Mary, nigga!
Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?

They got a A-P-B out on my thug family
Since Outlawz run these streets like these scandalous freaks
Our enemies die now, walk around half-dead
Head down, K-blasted off of Hennessy and Thai Chronic
Mixed in, now I'm twisted, blistered and high
Visions of me thug-livin' gettin' me by
Forever live, and I multiply, survived by thugs
When I die they won't cry unless they comin' with slugs

Peep the whole scene and whatever's goin' on around me
Brain kind of cloudy, smoked out, feelin' rowdy
Ready to wet the party up
And whoever in that motherfucker, nasty new street slugger
My heat seeks suckers on the regular
Mashin' in a stolen Black Ac' Integra
Cocked back, sixty seconds 'til the draw, that's when I'm deadin' ya
Feet first, you've got a nice Gat but my heat's worse
From a thug to preachin' church
I gave you love, now you eatin' dirt
Needin' work, and I ain't the nigga to put you on
‘Cause word is bond
When I was broke, I had to hustle 'til dawn
That's when the sun came up, there's only one way up
Hold your head and stay up
To all my niggas, get your pay and weight up
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate
If it's on, then it's on, we rape beat-breaks
Outlawz on a paper chase, can you relate?
To this shit I don't got be the shit I gotta take
Dealin' with fate, hopin' God don't close the gate

Come with me!
Hail Mary, nigga, run quick, see
What do we have here now?
Do you wanna ride or die?
We've been travelin' on this weary road
Sometimes life can be a heavy load
But we ride, ride it like a bullet
Hail Mary, hail Mary (Hail Mary)
We won't worry, everything will curry
Free like the bird in the tree
We won't worry, everything will curry
Yes, we free like the bird in the tree
We runnin' from the penitentiary
This is the time for we liberty
Hail Mary, hail Mary!

You are appreciated

When I was young, me and my mama had beef
Seventeen years old, kicked out on the streets
Though back at the time I never thought I'd see her face
Ain't a woman alive that could take my mama's place
Suspended from school, and scared to go home
I was a fool, with the big boys breakin' all the rules
I shed tears with my baby sister, over the years
We was poorer than the other little kids
And even though we had different daddies, the same drama
When things went wrong we'd blame Mama
I reminisce on the stress I caused, it was hell
Huggin' on my mama from a jail cell
And who'd think in elementary, hey
I'd see the penitentiary one day?
And runnin' from the police, that's right
Mama catch me, put a whoopin' to my backside
And even as a crack fiend, Mama
You always was a black queen, Mama
I finally understand
For a woman, it ain't easy tryin' to raise a man
You always was committed
A poor single mother on welfare, tell me how you did it
There's no way I can pay you back
But the plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated

Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Now, ain't nobody tell us it was fair
No love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there
He passed away and I didn't cry
'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger
They say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along
I was lookin' for a father, he was gone
I hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs
They showed a young brother love
I moved out and started really hangin'
I needed money of my own, so I started slangin'
I ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks
It feels good puttin' money in your mailbox
I love payin' rent when the rent is due
I hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you
'Cause when I was low you was there for me
You never left me alone, because you cared for me
And I could see you comin' home after work late
You're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hotplate
You just workin' with the scraps you was given
And Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'
But now the road got rough, you're alone
You're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)
Sweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)
Sweet lady, don't you know we love ya?

Pour out some liquor and I reminisce
'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama
And when it seems that I'm hopeless
You say the words that can get me back in focus
When I was sick as a little kid
To keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did
And all my childhood memories
Are full of all the sweet things you did for me
And even though I act crazy
I gotta thank the Lord that you made me
There are no words that can express how I feel
You never kept a secret, always stayed real
And I appreciate how you raised me
And all the extra love that you gave me
I wish I could take the pain away
If you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day
Everything will be alright if you hold on
It's a struggle every day, gotta roll on
And there's no way I can pay you back
But my plan is to show you that I understand
You are appreciated
Lady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)

We keep it rockin', we keep it rockin'

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness
The track hits your eardrum like a slug to your chest
Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends
I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace

Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Fiendin' for money and alcohol, the life of a Westside player
Where cowards die and the strong ball
Only in Cali where we riot, not rally, to live and die
In L.A. we wearin' Chucks, not Ballys (Yeah, that's right)
Dressed in Locs and Khaki suits, and ride is what we do
Flossin' but have caution: we collide with other crews
Famous because we throw grams
Worldwide, let them recognize from Long Beach to Rosecrans
Bumpin' and grindin' like a slow jam
It's Westside, so you know the Row won't bow down to no man
Say what you say, but give me that bomb beat from Dre
Let me serenade the streets of L.A
From Oakland to Sac-town, the Bay Area and back down
Cali is where they put their mack down; give me love!

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!
Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public (Hahaha)
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" 'cause motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
(And, uh) And my ambitions as a ridah (Excuse me, baby)
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her (Got ya)
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz 'cause, bitch, I'm barely broke (Hahaha)
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player, the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay us
I got no time for these bitches (Hell no), 'cause these hoes tried to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mil' so I'm wishin'
Competition got me blitzed on that bullshit they stressin' (Booyah)
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so (Haha)
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row (Yeah)
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on a scheme to come and trick us (Haha)
But thug niggas be on point and game tight (Yeah)
Me, Syke and Bogart are strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous, 'cause deep in they hearts they wanna be me
Uh, yeah (Haha), and now you got me right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, I catch you payin' attention
To my ambitions as a ridah

But they can't do nothin' to a G
(I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah)

It was my only wish to rise above these jealous
Coward motherfuckers I despise, when it's time to ride
I was the first to hop inside (Let's go, nigga, let's go), give me the .9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life (Yeah, nigga!)
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
So I open fire until you kill me, witness my steel (That's all you niggas got? Hahaha)
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama (Dear Mama), come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught (Shoot)
Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tyson
Thuggin' for life, and if you right, then, nigga, die for it
Let them other bustas try, at least you tried for it (Hahaha)
When it's time to die, then be a man and pick the way you leave (Yeah, nigga)
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me (My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Stay off the block, evade the cops 'cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years (I'm back, baby)
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds, sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
(Buck-buck-buck-buck-buck) Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish
My powers, so now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace (Them niggas cowards)
They cowards, that's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas (Bitch-ass niggas) on my team so indeed they wet me up (Punk niggas)
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it (Hahaha)
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it (Yeah, right)
Witness the realest, a who-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cries from all your people when they find her, must remind ya
(Thug life) My history'll prove I been it
Revenge on them niggas that played me and all the cowards that was down wit' it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya
Hopin' you listen, got you payin' attention to my ambitions
As a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
(My ambitions as a ridah)
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah

But you know what?

I bet you got it twisted, you don't know who to trust
So many player-hatin' niggas tryna sound like us
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin'
Straight to the depths of Hell is where those cowards goin'
Well, are you still down? Nigga, holla when you see me
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me
I got a caravan of niggas every time we ride
Hittin' motherfuckers up when we pass by
Until I die, live the life of a boss player
'Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later
The futures in my eyes, 'cause all I want is cash and thangs
A five-double-0 Benz, flauntin' flashy rings, uhh
Bitches pursue me like a dream
Been known to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend
It seems, my main thing was to be major paid
The game sharper than a motherfuckin' razor blade
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies
One nigga's gettin' jealous and motherfuckers died

Hey, to my nigga 'Pac

So much trouble in the world, nigga
Can't nobody feel your pain
The world's changin' every day, time's movin' fast
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?
I'm caught between my woman and my pistol and my chips
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin' life flawless
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this
Mediocres got a lot of nerve
Let my bucket swerve, I'm takin' off from the curb
The nervousness neglect make me pack a TEC
Devoted to servin' this Moët and pay checks
Like Akai satellite, nigga, I'm forever ballin'
It ain't right: parasites, triggers, and fleas crawlin'
Sucker, duck and get busted, no emotion
My devotion is handlin' my business, nigga, keep on coastin'
Where you goin', I been there, came back as lonely, homie
Steady flowin' against the grain, niggas still don't know me
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit
It ain't funny, niggas don't even know how to act, shit
What can I do? What can I say? Is there another way?
Blunts and gin all day, 24 parlay

Will I survive? Will I die? Come on, let's picture the possibility
Givin' me charges, lawyers makin' a grip
I told the judge I was raised wrong and that's why I blaze shit
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager
On my mobile, callin' big shots on the scene major
Packin' hundreds in my drawers, fuck the law

Keep your head up, nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer
Up in the Benz, burnin' rubber

You's a cold-ass nigga on them hogs

Sho 'nuff, I keep my hand on my gun
'Cause they got me on the run
Now I'm back in the courtroom, waitin' on the outcome

You might be deep in this game, but you got the rules missin'
Niggas be actin' like they savage, they out to get the cabbage
I've got nothin' but love for my niggas livin' lavish

I've got a pit named Petey, she Nigerino
I've got a house out in the hills, right next to Chino
And I think I've got a black Beamer
But my dream is to own a fly casino
Like Bugsy Siegel, and do it all legal
And get scooped up by the little homie in the Regal
It feels good to you, baby-bubba
You see, this is for the G's and the keys, motherfucker

Now, follow as we ride!
Motherfuck the rest, two of the best from the Westside!
And I can make you famous
Niggas been dyin' for years, so how can they blame us?
I live in fear of a felony
I never stop bailin' these motherfuckin' G's
If you got it, better flaunt it

Release me to the streets, and keep whatever's left of me
Jealousy is misery, suffery is greed
Better be prepared when you cowards fuck with me
I bust and flee
These niggas must be crazy, what?!
There ain't no mercy, motherfuckers, who can fade the thug?
You thought it was, but it wasn't, now disappear
Bow down in the presence of a boss player

It's like, Cuh, Blood, gang-bangin'
Everybody in the party doin' dope-slangin'
You gotta have paper in this world
You might get your first snatch before your eyes swirl
You doin' your job every day
And then you work so hard 'til your hair turn gray
Let me tell you 'bout life and 'bout the way it is
You see, we live by the gun, so we die by the guns, kid
They tell me not to roll with my Glock
So now I got a throw-away
Floatin' in the black Benz (Bitch), tryin' to do a show a day
They wonder how I live with five shots
Niggas is hard to kill on my block
Schemes for currency and dough-related
Affiliated with the hustlers, so we made it
No answers to questions, I'm tryin' to get up on it
My nigga, Dogg, and me, eternally the most wanted

Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party
Ain't nothin' but a gangsta party

How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on

As I bail through the empty halls, breath stinkin' in my jaws
Ring, ring, ring — quiet, y'all, incomin' call
Plus this my homie from high school, he gettin' by
It's time to bury another brother, nobody cry
Life as a baller: alcohol and booty calls
We used to do 'em as adolescents, do you recall?
Raised as G's, loc'ed out, and blazed the weed
Get on the roof, let's get smoked out, and blaze with me
Two in the morning and we still high, assed out
Screamin', ""Thug 'til I die!"" before I passed out
But now that you're gone, I'm in the zone
Thinkin' I don't wanna die all alone, but now you gone
And all I got left are stinkin' memories
I love them niggas to death, I'm drinkin' Hennessy
While tryin' to make it last
I drank a fifth for that ass when you passed, 'cause life goes on

Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, and life goes on

Yeah nigga, I got the word it's hell
You blew trial and the judge gave you 25 with an L
Time to prepare to do fed time, won't see parole
Imagine life as a convict that's gettin' old
Plus with the drama, we're lookin' out for your baby's mama
Takin' risks, while keepin' cheap tricks from gettin' on her
Life in the hood is all good for nobody
Remember gamin' on dumb hotties at yo' party
Me and you, no truer two, while schemin' on hits
And gettin' tricks that maybe we can slide into
But now you buried — rest, nigga, 'cause I ain't worried
Eyes blurry, sayin' goodbye at the cemetery
Though memories fade
I got your name tatted on my arm
So we both ball 'til my dyin' days
Before I say goodbye
Kato and Mental, rest in peace! Thug 'til I die!
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G

Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death

Bury me smilin' with G's in my pocket
Have a party at my funeral, let every rapper rock it
Let the hoes that I used to know
From way befo' kiss me from my head to my toe
Give me a paper and a pen, so I can write about my life of sin
A couple bottles of gin, in case I don't get in
Tell all my people I'm a Ridah
Nobody cries when we die, we Outlawz, let me ride
Until I get free
I live my life in the fast lane, got police chasin' me
To my niggas from old blocks, from old crews
Niggas that guided me through back in the old school
Pour out some liquor, have a toast for the homies
See, we both gotta die, but you chose to go before me
And brothers miss you while you gone
You left your nigga on his own; how long we mourn? Life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G
Be a lie If I told you that I never thought of death
My niggas, we the last ones left, but life goes on
How many brothers fell victim to the streets?
Rest in peace, young nigga, there's a heaven for a G

Life goes on, homie
Gone on, 'cause they passed away
Niggas doin' life
Niggas doin' 50 and 60 years and shit
I feel you, nigga, trust me, I feel you
You know what I mean?
Last year we poured out liquor for ya
This year, nigga, life goes on, we're gonna clock now
Get money, evade bitches, evade tricks
Give playa haters plenty of space
And basically just represent for you, baby
Next time you see your niggas, we gon' be on top, nigga
You gon' be like, ""Goddamn, them niggas came up!""
That's right, baby, life goes on
And we up out this bitch
Hey, Kato! Mental!

You try to plant somethin in the conrete, y'knowhatImean?
If it GROW, and the and the rose petal got all kind of
Scratches and marks, you not gon' say, ""Damn, look at
All the scratches and marks on the rose that grew from concrete""
You gon' be like, ""Damn! A rose grew from the concrete?!""
Same thing with me, y'knahmean? I grew out of all of this
Instead of sayin, ""Damn, he did this, he did this,""
Just be like, ""DAMN! He grew out of that? He came out of that?""
That's what they should say, y'knowhatImean?
All the trouble to survive and make good out of the dirty, nasty
Y'knowhahatImean unbelievable lifestyle they gave me
I'm just tryin to make somethin...

When no one even cared
The rose it grew from concrete
Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet
It came from concrete

Did you hear about the rose that grew from a crack in the concrete?
Provin nature's laws wrong it learned how to walk without havin feet
Funny it seems but, by keepin its dreams
It, learned to breathe FRESH air
Long live the rose that grew from concrete
When no one else even cared
No one else even cared...
The rose that grew from concrete

When no one else, even cared

Keepin all these dreams
Provin nature's laws wrong
It learned how to walk without havin feet (to breathe the fresh air)
It came from concrete (to breathe the fresh air)
(to breathe the fresh air, to breathe the fresh air)

You see you wouldn't ask why the rose that grew from the concrete
Had damaged petals. On the contrary, we would all celebrate its
Tenacity. We would all love it's will to reach the sun
Well, we are the roses - this is the concrete - and these are
My damaged petals. Don't ask me why, thank God nigga, ask me how!

Change, shit
I guess change is good for any of us
Whatever it take for any of y'all niggas to get up out the hood
Shit, I'm wit' ya, I ain't mad at cha
Got nothin' but love for ya, do your thing, boy
Yeah, all the homies that I ain't talk to in a while
I'ma send this one out for y'all
Know what I mean? 'Cause I ain't mad at cha
Heard y'all tearin' up shit out there
Kickin' up dust, givin' a motherfuck
Yeah, niggas, 'cause I ain't mad at cha

Now we was once two niggas of the same kind
Quick to holla at a hoochie with the same line
You was just a little smaller, but you still rolled
Got stretched to Y.A. and hit the hood swoll
'Member when you had a Jheri curl, didn't quite learn
On the block, wit'cha Glock, trippin' off sherm
Collect calls to the crib, sayin' how you've changed
Oh, you a Muslim now? No more dope game
Heard you might be comin' home, just got bail
Wanna go to the mosque, don't wanna chase tail
It seems I lost my little homie, he's a changed man
Hit the pen' and now no sinnin' is the game plan
When I talk about money, all you see is the struggle
When I tell you I'm livin' large, you tell me it's trouble
Congratulations on the weddin', I hope your wife know
She got a playa for life, and that's no bullshittin'
I know we grew apart, you probably don't remember
I used to fiend for your sister, but never went up in her
And I can see us after school, we'd bomb
On the first motherfucker with the wrong shit on
Now the whole shit's changed and we don't even kick it
Got a big money scheme and you ain't even with it
Knew in my heart you was the same motherfucker that
Go toe to toe when it's time to roll, you got a brother's back
And I can't even trip, 'cause I'm just laughin' at cha
You tryin' hard to maintain, then go ahead
'Cause I ain't mad at cha

We used to be like distant cousins, fightin', playin' dozens
Whole neighborhood buzzin', knowin' that we wasn't
Used to catch us on the roof or behind the stairs
I'm gettin' blitzed and I reminisce on all the times we shared
Besides bumpin' and grindin', wasn't nothin' on our mind
In time, we'd learned to live a life of crime
Rewind us back to a time was much too young to know
I caught a felony, lovin' the way the guns blow
And even though we separated, you said that you'd wait
Don't give nobody no coochie while I'll be locked up state
I kiss my mama goodbye and wipe the tears from her lonely eyes
Said I'll return but I gotta fight, the fate's arrived
Don't shed a tear, 'cause mama, I ain't happy here
I blew trial, no more smiles for a couple years
They got me goin' mad, I'm knockin' busters on they backs
In my cell, thinkin', ""Hell, I know one day I'll be back""
As soon as I touch down
I told my girl I'd be there, so prepare to get fucked down
The homies wanna kick it, but I'm just laughin' at cha
'Cause you's a down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
A true down-ass bitch and I ain't mad at cha

Well, guess who's movin' up? This nigga's ballin' now
Bitches be callin' to get it, hookers keep fallin' down
He went from nothin' to lots, ten carats to rock
Went from a nobody nigga to the big man on the block
He's Mr. Local-Celebrity, addicted to movin' ki's
Most hated by enemies, escape in the luxury
See, first you was our nigga, but you made it so the choice is made
Now we gotta slay you while you faded, in the younger days
So full of pain while the weapons blaze
Gettin' so high off that bomb, hopin' we make it to the better days
'Cause crime pays, and in time, you'll find a rhyme'll blaze
You'll feel the fire from the niggas in my younger days
So many changed on me, so many tried to plot
That I keep a Glock beside my head, when will it stop?
'Til God return me to my essence
'Cause even as an adolescent, I refused to be a convalescent
So many questions and they ask me if I'm still down
I moved up out of the ghetto, so I ain't real now?
They got so much to say, but I'm just laughin' at cha
You niggas just don't know, but I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
I ain't mad at cha
Hell nah, I ain't mad at cha

Only God can judge me (That right?)
Only God can judge me now
Nobody else (Nobody else)
All you other motherfuckers get out my business (Really)
Only God can judge me now

Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
I couldn't trust my own homies, just a bunch of dirty rats
Will I succeed? Paranoid from the weed
And hocus pocus, try to focus, but I can't see
And in my mind I'm a blind man doin' time
Look to my future, ‘cause my past is all behind me
Is it a crime to fight for what is mine?
Everybody's dyin', tell me what's the use in tryin'
I've been trapped since birth, cautious ‘cause I'm cursed
And fantasies of my family in a hearse
And they say it's the White man I should fear
But it's my own kind doin' all the killin' here
I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
Jealousy inside, make 'em wish I died
Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin' for
Everybody's droppin', got me knockin' on Heaven's door
And all my memories of seein' brothers bleed
And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
Recollect your thoughts, don't get caught up in the mix
‘Cause the media is full of dirty tricks

Flatline
I hear the doctor standin' over me, screamin' I can make it
Got a body full of bullet holes, layin' here naked
Still I can't breathe, something's evil in my IV
‘Cause everytime I breathe I think they killin' me
I'm havin' nightmares, homicidal fantasies
I wake up strangled, entangled in my bed sheets
I call the nurse ‘cause it hurts to reminisce
How did it come to this? I wish they didn't miss
Somebody help me, tell me where to go from here
‘Cause even thugs cry, but do the Lord care?
Try to remember but it hurts
I'm walkin' through the cemetery, talkin' to the dirt
I'd rather die like a man than live like a coward
There's a ghetto up in Heaven and it's ours
""Black Power!"" is what we scream
As we dream in a paranoid state
And our fate is a lifetime of hate
Dear Mama, can you save me? And fuck peace
‘Cause the streets got our babies, we gotta eat
No more hesitation, each and every black male's trapped
And they wonder why we suicidal running 'round strapped
Mr. Police, please try to see
That there's a million motherfuckers stressin' just like me
Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God

Only God can judge me
Only God can judge me, only God

That which does not kill me can only make me stronger
That's for real
And I don't see why everybody feel as though
That they gotta tell me how to live my life
You know?
Let me live, baby, let me live

Pac, I feel ya, keep servin' it on the reala
For instance, say a playa-hatin' mark is out to kill ya
Would you be wrong for buckin' a nigga to the pavement?
He gon' get me first, if I don't get him fool start prayin'
Ain't no such thing as self-defense in the court of law
So judge us when we get to where we're goin wearin' a cross
That's real, got him, lurked him, crept the fuck up on him
Sold a half a million tapes, now everybody want him
After talkin' behind my back like a bitch would
Tellin' them niggas, ""You can fade him""
Punk, I wish you would
It be them same motherfuckers in your face
That'll rush up in your place to get your safe
Knowin' you on that paper chase
Grass, glass, big screen and leather couch
My new shit is so fetti, already sold a ki or ounce
Bitch, remember 2Pac and 4-Tay
The same two brothers dodgin' bullets, representin' the Bay
Pac, when you was locked down, that's when ""I'll Be Around""
Start climbin' up the charts, so sick, but they tried to clown
That's why they ride the bandwagon
Still be draggin', sellin' lies
Don't think I don't see you haters, I know y'all in disguise
Guess you figure you know me, ‘cause I'm a thug
That love to hit the late night clubs drink them Buds
Been livin' lavish like a player all day
Now I'm 'bout to floss some boss player shit with 4-Tay

Is comin' back to this bitch reincarnated, man

It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby

Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops is hot for me
The projects is full of bullets
Though bodies is droppin' there ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly movin' while makin' millions
Witnessin' killings, leavin' dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children, 'cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket
The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried
I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry
The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger
Don't wanna make excuses
'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?
Unless we're shootin', no one notices the youth

Ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, livin' wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seein' Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin', I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route for a crooked Outlaw?
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

Everyday there's mo' death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seein' more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
'Cause ain't no bucks to stack up
My nuts is backed up, I'm about to act up
Go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried makin' fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in and make my mail
Makin' sales, riskin' 25 with a L, but oh well

With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this oppression?
They punish the people that's askin' questions
And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings
Don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let this pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreamin' of riches, in a position of makin' a difference
Politicians are hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothin' like the game; it's just me against the world
Me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game (Ooh yeah)
It's just me against the world
Nothin' to lose
It's just me against the world, baby

But, uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get

I should've seen
You was trouble right from the start, taught me so many lessons
How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions
When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps
We had some problems but we workin at it, and now
The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay
But I can’t help from walkin' out just throw it away
Just take my hand and understand, if you could see
I never planned to be your man it just wasn’t me
But now I’m searchin’ for commitment, in other arms
I wanna shelter you from harm, don’t be alarmed
Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin’
Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions
Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy
Now my ambition's to be free
I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap
I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love

What if I’m wrong, a trick to keep me holdin on
Tryin’ to be strong and in the process, keep you goin'
I’m 'bout to lose my composure, I’m gettin’ close
To packin’ up and leavin’ notes, and gettin’ ghost
Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go
To clear my head I’m feelin' low, losin’ control

When we conspire to conceive, and now
You gettin’ calls at the house, guess you cheatin’
That’s all I need to hear, 'cause I’m leavin’, I’m out the door
Never no more will you see me, this is the end

Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay
As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings’ll go away
It wasn’t always a hit-and-run relationship
It used to be love, happiness and companionship
Remember when I treated you good
I moved you up to the hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood
Me and you a happy home, when it was on
I had a love to call my own
I should've seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes
Preoccupied with gettin’ tossed, no need to lie
You had a man and I knew it, you told me
Don’t worry 'bout it, we can do it now I’m under pressure
Make a decision, 'cause I’m waitin’, when I’m alone
I’m on the phone havin’ secret conversations, huh
I wanna take your misery, replace it with happiness
But I need your faith in me, I’m a sucka for love
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love?
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up
What you won’t do, do for love
You tried everything, but you don’t give up

The blind stares of a million pairs of eyes
Lookin' hard but won't realize
That they will never see the P!
You must be goin' blind

Give me my money in stacks and lace my bitches with dime figures
Real niggas fingers on nickel-plated 9 triggers
Must see my enemies defeated
I catch 'em while they coked up and weeded
Open fire, now them niggas bleedin'
See me in flesh and test and get your chest blown
Straight out the West, don't get blown
My adversaries cry like hoes, open and shut like doors
Is you a friend or foe? Nigga, you ain't know?
They got me stressed out on Death Row
I've seen money, but baby, I've gots to get mo'
You screamin', ""Go 2Pac!"" and I ain't stoppin' till I'm well-paid
Bail's paid now, nigga, look what hell made
Visions of cops and sirens, niggas open fire
Bunch of Thug Life niggas on the rise, until I die
Ask me why I'm a boss player gettin' high
And when I'm rollin' by niggas can't see me!

The stares of a million pairs of eyes
And you'll never realize
You can't see me

Been gettin' word that these square motherfuckers with nerves
Sayin' they can get with us, but picture me gettin' served
My own mama say I'm thugged out
My shit be poppin' out the record store as if it was a drug house
My lyrics bang like a Crip or Blood
Nigga, what? It ain't nothin' but a party when we thug
And there I was, a young nigga with heart, ain't had shit to lose
Pullin' my pistol on them fools, you know the rules
D-R-E, you got me heated; my words like a penitentiary dick
Hittin' bitches where it's most needed
Money and weed, Alizé and Hennessy
To my thug niggas in lock down: witness me
Bail on these hoes in floss-mode
The life of a boss player, fuck what you thought though
My enemies deceased
Die like a bitch when my album hit the streets; niggas can't see me!

Niggas can't see me
They can't see me
Which way did he go, George?
Which way did he go?
Oh!! Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?
You niggas made a mistake
You should've never put my rhymes with Dre
Them thug niggas have arrived and it's judgement day
Hey homie, if you feel me
Tell them tricks that shot me that they missed, they ain't kill me
I can make a motherfucker shake, rattle and roll
I'm full of liquor, thug nigga, quick to jab at them hoes
And I can make you jealous niggas famous
Fuck around with 2Pac and see how good a nigga's aim is
I'm just a rich motherfucker from the way
If this rappin' bring me money, then I'm rappin' till I'm paid
I'm gettin' green like I'm supposed to
Nigga, I holla at these hoes and see how many I can go through
Look to the star and visualize my debut
Niggas know me, player, I gotta stay true
Don't be a dumb motherfucker 'cause it's crazy after dark
Where the true thug-niggas see your heart; niggas can't see me!

Yo, check this out: stay off his dick

Niggas can't see me
Right before your eyes, I'll disappear from here
You niggas can't see me
You can't see me
I know it's hard nigga, I'm all up in your face
But you still can't see me
You can't see me
All up in your range, but niggas can't see me
20/20 vision won't visualize
I'm in the flesh, baby, but you can't see me
All those glasses won't help you realize
You blinded, you blinded, you can't see me
You can't see me
Thug Life, baby
Don't believe everything you read! Alizé and weed
You can't see me, right before your very eyes
You won't even visualize, you can't see me
Dr. Dre all day, 2Pac
Niggas can't see me
I dedicate this to you punk motherfuckers!
This one's for you, BIG baby
'Cause you bitch-ass niggas can't see me
Niggas can't see me
You can't see me
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil

Yeah, first you see me, now you don't

But you know I'm lyin' though, ha! Yeah)

You probably crooked as the last trick
Want to laugh at how I got my ass caught up with this bad bitch?
Thinkin' I had her, but she had me in the long run
It's just my luck, I'm stuck with fuckin' with the wrong one
Wise decisions, based on lies we livin'
Scandalous times, this game's like my religion
You could be rollin' with a thug
Instead you with this weak scrub, lookin' for some love
In every club, I see you starin' like you want it
Well, baby, if you got it, better flaunt it
Let the liquor help you get up on it
I'm still tipsy from last night
Bumpin' these walls as I pause, addicted to the fast life
I try to holla, but you tell me you taken
Sayin' you ain't impressed with the money I'm makin'
Guess it's true what they tellin' me
Fresh out of jail, life's hell for a black celebrity
So that's the reason why I call, and maybe you with it
Fantasies of us sweatin', can I hit it? (Hell no)

Nobody loves me, I'm a thug nigga
I only hung out with the criminals and drug dealers
I love niggas 'cause we comin' from the same place
Witness me holla at a hoochie, see how quick the game takes
How can I tell her I'm a playa and I don't even care?
Creep though, weed smoke's in the air
Everywhere I go, it's all about the groupie hoes
Waitin' for niggas at the end of every show
I just seen you in my friend's video
Could never put a bitch before my friends, so here we go
Follow the leader and peep the drama that I'm goin' through

Explain to a nigga why I see the same shitty ho?
You think it's all about you? Well, boo
I gets down like Dru, and my nasty new niggas, too

You couldn't hold me back, it'd take a fatter track
A lyrical attack, perhaps, it was a visual bluff
When I started to snaps all your rode 'em swoll
Straight in control, flows'll fold, while hoes cold stroll
Hold the set, I told Dramacy' go in next
Gold diggin', cold diggin' a gold Rolex

I slide in easily, try a grizzly
Sluts know the cut, I came to fuck, try skeezin' me
Runnin' up in ya just like Bruce Jenner when I bend ya

Still clown with the Underground, when we come around
(Step up, step-step up, step up)
'Round and 'round, 'round we go (stronger than ever)
'Round and 'round

Back to get wrecked, all respect
To those who break their neck to keep their hoes in check
‘Cause, oh, they sweat a brother majorly
And I don't know why your girl keeps pagin' me
She tell me that she needs me, cries when she leaves me
And every time she sees me, she squeeze me—lady, take it easy!
Hate to sound sleazy, but tease me
I don't want it if it's that easy
Ayo, bust it, baby got a problem saying ""Bye-bye""
Just another hazard of a fly guy
You ask ""Why?"", don't matter, my pockets got fatter
Now everybody's lookin' for the latter
And ain't no need in being greedy, if you wanna see me
Dial the beeper number, baby, when you need me
And I'll be there in a jiffy
Don't be picky, just be happy with this quickie
When will ya learn you can't tie me down

Baby, I can see, that you don't recognize me
I'm Shock G, the one who put the satin on your panties
Never knew a hooker that could share me; I get around

What's up, love? How you doin'? (All right)
Well, I've been hangin', sangin' tryna do my thang, oh, you heard that I was bangin'
Your homegirl you went to school with? That's cool
But did she tell you about her sister and your cousin? Thought I wasn't (Uhh)
See, weekends were made for Michelob
But it's a Monday, my day, so just let me hit it, yo
And don't mistake my statement for a clown

I shall not fear no man but God
Though I walk through the valley of death
I shed so many tears
If I should die before I wake
Please God walk with me
Grab a nigga and take me to Heaven

Back in elementary, I thrived on misery
Left me alone, I grew up amongst a dyin' breed
Inside my mind couldn't find a place to rest
Until I got that Thug Life tatted on my chest
Tell me, can you feel me? I'm not livin' in the past
You wanna last? Be the first to blast
Remember Kato, no longer with us, he's deceased
Call on the sirens, seen him murdered in the streets
Now he rest in peace
Is there a heaven for a G? Remember me
So many homies in the cemetery, shed so many tears

Ahh, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now that I'm strugglin' in this business, by any means
Label me greedy gettin' green, but seldom seen
And fuck the world 'cause I'm cursed
I'm havin' visions of leavin' here in a hearse
God, can you feel me?
Take me away from all the pressure and all the pain
Show me some happiness again
I'm goin' blind, I spend my time in this cell, ain't livin' well
I know my destiny is Hell, where did I fail?
My life is in denial and when I die
Baptized in eternal fire, I'll shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
Lord, I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears

Now I'm lost and I'm weary, so many tears
I'm suicidal, so don't stand near me
My every move is a calculated step
To bring me closer to embrace an early death
Now there's nothin' left
There was no mercy on the streets
I couldn't rest, I'm barely standin'
About to go to pieces, screamin' peace
And though my soul was deleted, I couldn't see it
I had my mind full of demons tryin' to break free
They planted seeds and they hatched, sparkin' the flame
Inside my brain like a match, such a dirty game
No memories, just a misery
Paintin' a picture of my enemies killin' me in my sleep
Will I survive 'til the morning to see the sun?
Please Lord, forgive me for my sins, 'cause here I come
Lord! (God!)
I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

Lord knows I, tried, been a witness to homicide
Seen drive-by's takin' lives, little kids die
Wonder why as I walk by
Broken-hearted as I glance at the chalk line, gettin' high
This ain't the life for me, I wanna change
But ain't no future bright for me, I'm stuck in the game
I'm trapped inside a maze
See this Tanqueray influenced me to gettin' crazy
Disillusioned lately, I've been really wantin' babies
So I could see a part of me that wasn't always shady
Don't trust my lady 'cause she's a product of this poison
I'm hearin' noises, think she's fuckin' all my boys
Can't take no more, I'm fallin' to the floor
Beggin' for the Lord to let me in to Heaven's door
Shed so many tears (God please help me)

Lord, I lost so many years (I suffered through the years)
And shed so many tears
I lost so many peers
And shed so many tears
Lord, I suffered through the years
And shed so many tears
God, I lost so many peers

Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me (My ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days (Days)
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays, things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth, 'cause the truth look strange
And for me, it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts (Hurts)
‘Cause any day, they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary? The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white, ‘cause we human

Livin' out a bag, but she's glad for the little things she has
And over there, there's a lady
Crack got her crazy, guess who's givin' birth to a baby?
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the fryin' pan, we jump into another form of slavery
Even now, I get discouraged
Wonder, if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage?
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles (Own bottles)
I make mistakes, but learn from every one
And when it's said and done, I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you, don't stress
Never forget that God isn't finished with me yet
I feel his hand on my brain
When I write rhymes, I go blind and let the Lord do his thing
But am I less holy
'Cause I choose to puff a blunt and drink a beer with my homies?
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets
My ghetto gospel
Those who wish to follow me (Yeah, ghetto gospel)
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last

A gritty little somethin' on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat

She simply said, ""No,"" labeled me a ho
I said, ""How you figure?"" ""My friends told me so""
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hun, I don't get down like that
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could do like Uncle L and swing an ep' in my Jeep
Keep it on the down, yo, we keep it discreet
See, I'm not the type of kid to have my biz in the streets
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl, I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture

We don't believe you 'cause we the people
Are still here in the rear, ayo, we don't need you
You in the killing-off-good-young-nigga mood
When we get hungry we eat the same fucking food
The ramen noodle
Your simple voodoo is so maniacal, we're liable to pull a juju
The irony is that this bad bitch in my lap
She don't love me, she make money, she don't study that
She gon' give it to me, ain't gon' tell me run it back
She gon' take the brain to wetter plains, she spit on that
The doors have signs with, don't try to rhyme with
VH1 has a show that you can waste your time with
Guilty pleasures take the edge off reality
And for a salary I'd probably do that shit sporadically
The OG Gucci boots are smitten with iguanas
The IRS piranha see a nigga gettin' commas
Niggas in the hood living in a fishbowl
Gentrify here, now it's not a shit hole
Trendsetter, I know, my shit's cold
Ain't settling because I ain't so bold but ay

All you Black folks, you must go

The fog and the smog of news media that logs
False narratives of Gods that came up against the odds
We're not just nigga rappers with the bars
It's kismet that we're cosmic with the stars

You bastards overlooking street art
Better yet, street smarts but you keep us off the charts
So motherfuck your numbers and your statisticians
Fuck y'all know about true competition?
That's like a AL pitcher on deck talking about he hittin'
The only one who's hitting are the ones that's currently spittin'
We got your missy smitten rubbing on her little kitten
Dreaming of a world that's equal for women with no division
Boy, I tell you that's vision
Like Tony Romo when he hitting Witten
The Tribe be the best in they division
Shaheed Muhammad cut it with precision
Who can come back years later, still hit the shot?
Still them tryna move we off the fucking block
Babylon, bloodclaat
Two pon yuh headtop

All you Black folks, you must go

Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?

Ayo, Bo knows this (What?) And Bo knows that (What?)
But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot, so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say, ""The Tribe can't flow""
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (Yeah!)
Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meanin' from the get-go
Sit back, relax, and let yourself go
Don't sweat what you heard, but act like you know
You might also like
Yes, yes, y'all! (Yes, y'all!)
Who got the vibe? It's the Tribe, y'all! (Tribe, y'all!), real live, y'all! (Live, y'all!)
Inside, outside, come around
(Who's that?) Broooown!
So may I say, call me Charlie
The word is the herb and I'm deep like Bob Marley
Lay back on the payback, evolve, rotate the gates
Contact!
Can I get a hit? (Hit!) Boom bip
With a brother named Tip and we're ready to flip
East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'
New York, North Cak-a-laka, and Compton
Checka-checka-check it out
The loops for the troops, more bounce to the ounce
And wow-how-now-wow, how now, Brown cow?
We're ill 'til the skill gets down for the flex
Next it's the textbook, old to the new
But the rest are doo-doo
From radio to the video, to Arsenio
Tell me, yo, what's the scenario?

(True, blue!) Scooby Doo, whoopie doo
Scenarios, radios, rates more than four
Scores for the s'mores that smother dance floors
Now I go for mine, shades of sea shore
Ship-shape, crushed grapes, apes that play tapes
Papes make drakes baked for the wakes
Of an L-ah, an -eader! Simply just a leader
Base in the space means peace, see you later
Later (Later!) Later, alligator
Pop blows the weasel and the urge to inflate her
So, yo, the D, what, the O
Incorporated I-N-C into a flow
Funk flipped, flat back, first this, foul, fight, fight, fight, laugh
Yo, how'd that sound? (Oooh!)
It's a Leader-Quest mission and we got the goods here (Here!)
Never on the left, 'cause my right's my good ear (Ear!)
I could give a damn about a ill subliminal
Stay away from crime, so I ain't no criminal!
I love my young nation, groovy sensation
No time for hibernation, only elation
Don't ever try to test the water, little kid
Yo, Mr. Busta Rhymes, tell 'em what I did
I heard you rushed and rushed and attacked
Then they rebuked and you had to smack
Causin' rambunction throughout the sphere
Raise the levels of the boom inside the ear (You know I did it)
So don't violate or you'll get violated
The hip hop sound is well agitated
Won't ever waste no time on a played out ego
So here's Busta Rhymes with the scenario:

Watch as I combine all the juice from the mind
Heel up, wheel up, bring it back, come, rewind
Powerful impact (Boom!) from the cannon!
Not braggin', tryna read my mind, just imagine
Vocabulary's necessary when diggin' into my library
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
Eatin' Ital Stew like the one Peter Tosh, uh
Ugh, ugh, ugh! All over the track, man
Ugh, pardon me, ugh! As I come back!
As I did it, yo, I had to beg your pardon
When I travel through the town, I roll with the squadron
Rawr! Rawr! Like a dungeon dragon
Change your little drawers, 'cause your pants are saggin'
Try to step to this, I will twist you in a turban
And have you smellin' rank like some old, stale urine
Chickity Choco, the chocolate chicken
The rear cock diesel, buttcheeks, they were kickin'
Yo, bust it out before the Busta bust another rhyme
The rhythm is in sync (Uh!), the rhymes are on time (Time!)
Rippin' up the sound just like Horatio
Observe the vibe and check out the scenario
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo (Yeah, my man, motherfucker)
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo

Can I kick it? To all the people who can Quest like A Tribe does
Before this, did you really know what live was?
Comprehend to the track, for it's why cuz
Gettin measures on the tip of the vibers
Rock and roll to the beat of the funk fuzz
Wipe your feet really good on the rhythm rug
If you feel the urge to freak, do the jitterbug
Come and spread your arms if you really need a hug
Afrocentric living is a big shrug
A life filled with fun that's what I love
A lower plateau is what we're above
If you diss us, we won't even think of
Will Nipper the doggy give a big shove?
This rhythm really fits like a snug glove
Like a box of positives it's a plus, love

Right now, Phife is a poem sayer
At times, I'm a studio conveyor
Mr. Dinkins, would you please be my mayor?
You'll be doing us a really big favor
Boy this track really has a lot of flavor
When it comes to rhythms, Quest is your savior
Follow us for the funky behavior
Make a note on the rhythm we gave ya
Feel free, drop your pants, check your ha-ir
Do you like the garments that we wear?
I instruct you to be the obeyer
A rhythm recipe that you'll savor
Doesn't matter if you're minor or major

Uh, uh, uh, check the rhyme

Back in the days on the boulevard of Linden
We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, The Abstract
And me, the Five Footer
I kicks the mad style so step off the frankfurter
Yo, Phife, you remember that routine
That we used to make spiffy like Mr. Clean?
Um... um... a tidbit, um... a smidgen
I don't get the message so you gots to run the pigeon
Heh, okay, you on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
You on point, Phife? All the time, Tip
Well, then grab the microphone and let your words rip

Now here's a funky introduction of how nice I am
Tell your mother, tell your father, send a telegram
I'm like an energizer 'cause, you see, I last long
My crew is never ever wack because we stand strong
Now if you say my style is wack, that's where you're dead wrong
I slayed that Buddy in El Segundo then Push it Along
You'd be a fool to reply that Phife is not the man
'Cause you know and I know that you know who I am
A special shout of peace goes out to all my pals, you see
And a middle finger goes for all you punk MC's
'Cause I love it when you wack MC's despise me
They get vexed, I roll next, can't none contest me
I'm just a fly MC who's five foot three and very brave
On top remaining, no home training 'cause I misbehave
I come correct in full effect have all my hoes in check
And before I get the butt, the Jim must be erect
You see, my aura's positive, I don't promote no junk
See, I'm far from a bully and I ain't a punk
Extremity in rhythm, yeah, that's what you heard
So just clean out your ears and just check the word

We used to kick routines and the presence was fittin'
It was I, the Phifer And me, the Abstract
The rhymes were so rumpin' that the brothers rode the 'zack
Aiyo Tip, do you recall when we used to rock What?
Those fly routines on your cousin's block?
Um, let me see... damn, I can't remember
I receive the message and you will play the sender
You on point Tip? All the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yeah, all the time, Phife
You on point Tip? Yo, all the time, Phife
So play the resurrector and give the dead some life

Okay, if knowledge is the key then just show me the lock
Got the scrawny legs but I move just like Lou Brock
With speed, I'm agile plus I'm worth your while
One hundred percent intelligent Black child
My optic presentation sizzles the retina
How far must you go to gain respect? Umm...
Well, it's kinda simple, just remain your own
Or you'll be crazy, sad and alone
Industry rule number four-thousand-and-eighty;
Record company people are shady
So kids, watch your back 'cause I think they smoke crack
I don't doubt it, look at how they act
Well, off to better things like a hip-hop forum
Pass me the rock and I'll score 'em with decorum
And proper—what you say, Hammer? Proper
Rap is not pop, if you call it that then stop

Yo, microphone check one, two, what is this?
The five foot assassin with the roughneck business
I float like gravity, never had a cavity
Got more rhymes than the Winans got family
No need to sweat Arsenio to gain some type of fame
No shame in my game cause I'll always be the same
Styles upon styles upon styles is what I have
You wanna diss the Phifer but you still don't know the half
I sport New Balance sneakers to avoid a narrow path
Mess around with this you catch a size eight up your ass
I never half-step cause I'm not a half-stepper
Drink a lot of soda so they call me Dr. Pepper
Refuse to compete with BS competition
Your name ain't Special Ed
So won't you seckle with the mission
I never walk the street thinking it's all about me
Even though deep in my heart, it really could be
I just try my best to like go all out
Some might even say yo shorty black you're buggin' out

Zulu Nation, brothers last creation
Minds get flooded, ejaculation
Right on the two-inch tape
The Abstract poet incognito, runs the cape
Not the best not the worst and occasionally I curse
To get my point across, so bust, the floss
As I go in between, the grit and the dirt
Listen to the mission listen Miss as I do work, umm
As I crack the, monotone
Children of the jazz so, get your own
Smokin R&B cause they try to do me
Or the best of the pack but they can't do rap
For it's Abstract, original
You can't get your own and that's, pitiful
I know I'd be the man if I cold yanked the plug
On R&B, but I can't and that's bugged

Yo when you bug out
You usually have a reason for the action
Sometimes you don't it's just for mere satisfaction
People be hounding, always surrounding
Pulsing, just like a migraine pounding
You don't really fret, you stay in your sense
Camouflage your feeling, of absolute tense
You soar off to another world, deep in your mind
But people seem to take that, as being unkind
""Oh yo he's acting stank,"" really on a regal?
A man of the fame not a man of the people
Believe that if you wanna but I tell you this much
Riding on the train with no dough, sucks
Once again a case of your feet in my Nike's
If a crowd is in my realm I'm saying -- mic please
Hip-hop is living, can't yank the plug
If you do the result, will end up kind of bugged
Yo, I am not an invalid although
I used to smoke the weed out
Ali Shaheed Muhammad used to say I had to be out
Scheming on the cookies with the crazy booming back buns
Pushing on them real hard just so we can have the big fun
When I left for road, see, I was Boulevard status
Battling an MC was when Tip was at his maddest
It was one MC after one MC
What the world could they be wanting see from little old me
Do I have the formula to save the world?
Or was it just because I used to
Swipe the women and all the girls
I'm the type of brother with the crazy extended hand, kid
Dissed by all my brothers I was all up what my man did
Supposed to be my man
But now I wonder cause you're feeble
I go out with the strongies and I separate the evils
It's your brain against my mind, for those about to boot out
All you nasty critters even though you see I bug out

We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz
We got the jazz, we got the jazz

Stern firm and young with a laid-back tongue
The aim is to succeed and achieve at 21
Just like Ringling Brothers, I'll daze and astound
Captivate the mass, cause the prose was profound
Do it for the strong, we do it for the meek
Boom it in your boom it in your boom it in your Jeep
Or your Honda, or your Bimmer, or your Legend, or your Benz
The rave of the town to your foes and your friends
So push it, along, trails, we blaze
Don't deserve the gong, don't deserve the praise
The tranquility will make you unball your fist
For we put Hip Hop on a brand new twist
A brand new twist with a whole heap of mystic
So low-key that you probably missed it
And yet it's so loud that it stands in the crowd
When the guy takes the beat, they bowed
So raise up squire, adjust your attire
We have no time to wallow in the mire
If you're on a foreign path, then let me do the lead
Join in the essence of the cool-out breed
Then cool out to the music cause it makes you feel serene
With the birds and the bees and all those groovy things
Like getting stomach aches when you gotta go to work
Or staring into space when you're feeling berserk
I don't really mind if it's over your head
Cause the job of resurrectors is to wake up the dead
So pay attention, it's not hard to decipher

How's about that, it seems like it's my turn again
All through the years my mic has been my best friend
I know some brothers wonder, can Phife really kick it?
Some even wanna diss me, but why sweat it?
I'm all into my music cos it's how I make papes
Try to make hits, like Kid Capri makes tapes
Me sweat another? I do my own thing
Strictly hardcore tracks, not a new jack swing
I grew up as a Christian so to Jah I give thanks
Collect my banks, listen to Shabba Ranks
I sing, and chat, I do all of that
It's 1991 and I refuse to come wack
I take off my hat to other crews that tend to rock
But the Low End Theory's here, it's time to wreck shop
I got Tip and Shah (huh), so whom shall I fear? (Word)
Stop look and listen, but please don't stare (uh)
So jet to the store, and buy the LP (yeah)
On Jive/RCA, cassettes and CD's
Produced and arranged (huh?) by the four-man crew
And oh shit, Skeff Anselm, he gets props too (ha-ha)
Make sure you have a system with some fat house speakers (Yeah)
So the new shit can rock (uh), from Bronx to Massapequa (uh)
Cause where I come from quality is job one
And everybody up on Linden know we get the job done
So peace to that crew (yeah), and peace to this crew (Yeah)
Bring on the tour, we'll see you at a theatre nearest you
Hey yo but wait, back it up, hup, easy back it up
Please let the Abstract embellish on the cut
Back and forth just like a Cameo song
If you dig this joint then please come dance along
To the music cause it's done just for the rhyme
Now I gotta scat and get mine, underline
The jazz, the what? The jazz can move that ass
Cause the Tribe originates that feeling of pizazz
It's the universal sound, bless the brothers on the ground
And the ones six below, you didn't have to go
Some say that I'm eccentric cause I once had an orgy
And sometimes for breakfast I eat grits and porgies
If this is a stinker, then call me a skunk, I ask

It’s time to go left and not right
Gotta get it together forever
Gotta get it together for brothers
Gotta get it together for sisters
For mothers and fathers and dead niggas
For non-conformists, one hitter quitters
For Tyson types and Che figures
Let’s get it together, come on let’s make it
Gotta make it to make it, to make it, to make it, to make it
To make something happen, to make something happen
To make something happen, let’s make something happen

Word to Phifer
Gonna bring it to the overlord, drinkin' Cisco
Chilling with the gold microphone cords
And we grip our balls every time we stuntin' on tour
'Cause we never bore, responding to the ready crowd's roar
And promoters try to hit us with the art of war
We about our business, we not quitters
Not bullshitters, we deliver—we go-get it
Don’t be bitter 'cause we not just niggas
Jarobi, my fiber wove into different cloth
Ain’t nothing forbidden, this nigga get his written off
Hardest spit in the city y’all niggas spitting kitten soft
Confused and amazed, shook up with your brain missing lost
They planning for our future, people
None of our people involved
Pouring Henny and Smirnoff to get it cracking off
Cracking off a Smirnoff to quickly turn to Molotov
Molotov the spaceship doors before that bitch is taking off
It always seems the poorest persons
Are people forsaken, dawg
No Washingtons, Jeffersons, Jacksons
On the captain's log
They’d rather lead us to the grayest water poison deadly smog
Mass un-blackening, it’s happening, you feel it y’all?
Rather see we in a three-by-three structure with many bars
Leave us where we are so they can play among the stars
They taking off to Mars, got the space vessels overflowing
What, you think they want us there? All us niggas not going
Reputation ain’t glowing, reparations ain’t flowing
If you find yourself stuck in a creek, you better start rowing
Used to see the TV screen as the place to land my dream in
And the car stereo where they would promote the show
Optimistic little brother with a hope you know

Sit and wonder sometimes, I read the paper every day
All these happenings is cycular, just happen different ways
And the president's refined, in her wing she's confined
With about thirty Percocets and five bottles of wine
Carolina nothing finer than a Black woman who climbs
To the top of the State building claiming that that flag is mine
Now, people on top of people, feels like we can’t breathe
Put so much in this muthafucka, feel like we shouldn't leave
Put it on TV, put it in movies, put it in our face
These notions and ideas and citizens live in space
I chuckle just like all of y'all, absurdity, after all
Takes money to get it running and money for trees to fall
Imagine for one second all the people are colored, please
Imagine for one second all the people in poverty
No matter the skin tone, culture or time zone
Think the ones who got it
Would even think to throw you a bone?
Moved you out your neighbourhood, did they find you a home?
Nah cypher, probably no place to
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude
Imagine if this shit was really talkin’ about space, dude

People, give your ears, so I be sublime
It's enjoyable to know you and the concubines
Niggas, take off your coats, ladies, act like gems
Sit down Indian style as we recite these hymns
See, lyrically I'm Mario Andretti on the MOMO
Ludicrously speedy or infectious with the slow-mo
Heard me in the '80s, J.B.s on ""The Promo""
In my never-endin' quest to get the paper on the caper
But now, let me take it to the Queens side
I'm takin' it to Brooklyn side
All the residential Questers who invade the air
Hold up a second, son, 'cause we almost there
You can be a Black man and lose all your soul
You can be white and groove, but don't crap the roll
See my shit is universal if you got knowledge of dolo
Or delf or self, see there's no one else
Who can drop it on the angle, acute at that
So who that, do that, do-do that, that, that (Come on)
Who that, do that, do-do that, that, that (Yeah, okay)
Do that, do that, do-do that, that, that
I'm buggin' out, but let me get back, 'cause I'm wettin' niggas
So run and tell the others, 'cause we are the brothers

Back in '89, I simply slid into place
Buddy, buddy, buddy all up in your face
A lot of kids was bustin' rhymes, but they had no taste
Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
I have a quest to have a mic in my hand
Without that, it's like Kryptonite and Superman
So, Shaheed, come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage call me Dynomutt
When was the last time you heard the Phifer sloppy?
Lyrics anonymous, you'll never hear me copy
Top notch, baby, never comin' less
Sky's the limit, you gots to believe up in Quest
Sit back, relax, get up out the path
If not that, here's a dance floor, come move that ass
Non-believers, you can check the stats
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
Niggas know the time when Quest is in the jam
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Comin' with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Livin' mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
So next time that you think you want somethin' here
Make somethin' def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Back in the days when I was a teenager
Before I had status and before I had a pager
You could find the Abstract listenin' to hip-hop
My pops used to say, it reminded him of Bebop
I said, ""Well, Daddy, don't you know that things go in cycles?
Way that Bobby Brown is just amping like Michael""
It's all expected, things are for the lookin'
If you got the money, Quest is for the bookin'
Come on everybody, let's get with the fly mode
Still got room on the truckload of black boom
Listen to the rhymes, then get a mental picture
Of this black man, and black woman fixture
Why do I say that? 'Cause I gotta speak the truth, man
Doin' what we feel for the music is the proof, and
Planted on the ground, the act is so together
Bona fide strong, you need leverage to sever
The unit, yes, the unit, yes, the unit called the jazz is
Delivering each year an LP filled with street goods
You can find it on your rack in your record store
If you get the record, say your thoughts are adored
And appreciated, 'cause we're ever so glad we made it
We work hard, so we gotta thank God
Dishin' out the plastic, do the dance till you're spastic
If you diss—it gets drastic
Listen to the rhyme, 'cause it's time to make gravy
If it moves your booty, then shake, shake it, baby
All the way to Africa, A.K.A. the Motherland
Stick out the left, then I'll ask for the other hand
That's the right hand, Black man
Only if you are noted as my man
If I get the credit, then I think I deserve it
If you fake moves, don't fix your mouth to word it
Get in the zone of positivity, not negativity
'Cause we gotta strive for longevity
If you botch up, what's in that 
(What?) A pair of Nikes, size ten-and-a-half

""Time, time is a ship on a merciless sea
Drifting toward an abyss of nothingness
Until it can be recharted for its own destiny
Time is an inanimate object paying and paying and paying for no justification for belief
Time is dancing, boogalooing-away all memories of past—""

We gotta be a winner all the time
Can't fall prey to a hip-hop crime
With the dope raps and dope tracks we move blocks
From the fly girlies to the hardest of the rocks
Musically the Quest, is on the rise
We on these excursions so you must realize
That continually, I pop my Zulu 
If you don't like it, get off the Zulu tip
So what can you do in the times which exist
You can't fake moves on your brother or your sis
But if your sis is a , brother is a jerk
Leave 'em both alone and continue with your work
Whatever it may be in today's society
Everything is fair, least that's how it seems to me
You must be honest and true to the next
Don't be phony and expect one not to flex
Especially if you rhyme, you have to live by the pen
Your man is your man, then treat him like your friend
All it is, is the code of the streets
So listen to the knowledge being dropped over beats
Beats that are hard, beats that are funky
They could get you hooked like a crackhead junkie
What you gotta do is know the Tribe is in the sphere
The Abstract Poet, prominent like Shakespeare
(Or Edgar Allan Poe, or Langston Hughes, or...)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)
We gotta make moves
Never, ever, ever could we fake moves (come on, come on)

We ended our hiatus, the dogs looking for food

Toleration for devastation, got a hunger for sin
Every nation Obama nation, let the coroner in
Crooked faces, red and blue laces for the color of men

If rationale is naturale or a weave

And she's feeling my Vader
And my lure grows greater and greater

Have your chi in virtual think pieces
(See, these written words are poetical science
Brain's defiant, thoughts heavy, baby
They're a major appliance)Leave a dent when drop with the flyness, fluent giant
Dude's nice, he tight, screwed in with some pliers
Cool with some buyers
Yeah, nigga, cool with some growers
(Never no tattletales, only I don't knowers)
We a show me generation, show us what you gon' show us
So listen, mami, see we could collude with a boing
Mouthpiece like Goines, with a jubilant noise
Dudes rude and as useless as coins, shoot 'em boys

Oops... my mistake, I didn't know you went with her
Should I run down the line of all the kids that done hit her?
Don't be bitter, I hear that honey resembles a critter
Heard she likes the two-on-one like my man John Ritter
But back to the subject, you can't catch wreck
You must get respect, to earn respect
Suckers think they could hurt me, 'cause now I wear specs
You're full of jokes, but yo, your name ain't Flex

Now, you caught my heart for the evening
Kissed my cheek, moved in, you confuse things
Should I just sit out or come harder?
Help me find my way

Messing me up, my whole head
Teasing me, just like Tisha did Martin
Now look at what you're starting
Schoolboy's crush and it ain't on the hush
The whole world sees it but you can't (uh)
My peoples they complain, sit and rave and rant (come on)
Your name is out my mouth like an ancient chant (say what?)
Got me like a dog as I pause and pant
*heavy breathing*

Speakin' of which..
Got a leash and I wish just to rock you, Miss (C'mon)
Make a militant move, peep my strategy (What?)
End of the day, you're not mad at me (Ugh)
Not dealin' with nobody, now that's what you told me (What?)
I said, ""Hey, yo, it's cool, we can just be friendly"" (C'mon)
'Cause yo, picture me messin' it up
Her mind not corrupt, with the ill C-cups
Shit! I'm on my J.O. (C'mon)

I ain't even gon' lie, I was probably high
Just forgot to call you back, simple as that
I ain't no almanac, so lick my dictionary
I might just call a cab 'cause I dig canary
Yellow accents on a dark bitch
I met her back when she kept all her carpet
I'm well aware all that shit is fantasy
I double dare y'all to fuck your plan B
That's demeanor, momma's mannerisms
That mean, don't mean to get vulgar, but it's some
Hoes in this bitch like a box of donuts
It's cold out in this bitch, standing on the corner
Condolences to niggas that got erased
I pour out some liquor on a cop's grave
Mmm, digital church bells
Ringin' 'cross the street, sure work well

Mom, I think you fuckin' lied to me
Three stacks said all this shit is fantasy
It's my time, gon' put a little life to it
If life's a obstacle then I'mma bike through it
I see it like a kiddie on the carousel
If I 'url while I go around, what the hell
And that went well, so I'm compelled
To have visions of getting chicken while my friends get jel
My young nigga motto was, ""Fuck it, I'm already grown""
And I dream of when I'm sixteen, I'm out my home
That petty though, 'cause my mama boyfriend dough
It's kinda long like this old head hustle, yo
He cognizant of a nigga ride and die
I see us getting money through my green eyes

Kids, say I'm the shit
I'm Chick-fil-A nuggets, McDonald's french fries
The spicy Popeye's and Red Lobster biscuits
And girls scout thin mints
Pardon my penmanship, but oh shit
Feel like I'm hungry now again
And I can't do nothing about it because my teeth are all rotted
And my mom and my pop, they just grin
And empathize with me 'cause they were little like Pygmies
But too bad they can't get back they 'member whens
Them grown-up stories don't work
In the court of the kiddies', the judgement is in
And while y'all doing all y'all your bids, y'all reminisce as kids
Fuck it, kids, the grown-ups won't own up
They stood on the corner
Like you once upon a, time
And probably felt like a loner
And smelled like a stoner, and snuck to Daytona
So when they questioning you 'bout who or who you ain't boning
Complaining that you always moaning
Never saying good morning
Storming out my house
And slamming doors like you paying bills
They been through it too, though
They were kids like you, though
But what if they knew though
And hit you with the cheat code
To a game you just start playing, no extra man
Leave you reckless on the court
With no high percentage shot
Just a bunch of, ""You got 'em, nigga, just give it what you got""
Yeah, it look a little different on a yacht
But ain't gon' lie, I miss kayaking
I love the young niggas, and they do too, they just be acting
Like a bunch of retired tired thespians, a bit too salty
Shit, their blood pressure high, why?
They don't play no more, probably

Listen up, everybody, the bottom line
I'm a Black intellect, but unrefined
With precision like a bullet, target bound
Just livin' like a hooker, the harlot sounds
Now when I say the harlot, you know I mean the hot
Heat of the equator, the broth that's in the pot

Licks, licks, licks, boy, pon your backside (Uh)

Tip the earthly body, Heaven's on my side
Even in Santo Domingo when I got a Gringo
We got mics, when do we go?
Know a little nigga who can rhyme when you ask me
Short, dark, and plus his voice is raspy (Phife)

One for the treble, two for the bass
You know the style, Tip, it's time to flip this
I like my beats hard like two day old shit
Steady eatin' booty MCs like cheese grits
My man Al B. Sure, he's in effect mode
Used to have a crush on Dawn from En Vogue
It's not like honey dip would wanna get with me
But just in case, I own more condoms than TLC
Now the formula is this, Me, Tip and Ali
For those who can't count, it goes one-two-three
The anti— (Damn, right I'm s—) big up is who I be
Brothers find this hard to do, but never me
Some brothers try to diss, but Malik, you see 'em bitchin'?
Me nah care about dem dibby MC, my shit is hittin'
Trini gladiator, anti-hesitater
Shaheed push the fader from here to Grenada
Mr. Energetic, who me sound pathetic?

-gy

1988 senior year at Garvey High
Where all the guys were corny but the girls were mad fly
Lounging with the Tipster, cooling with Sha
Scoping out the honeys—they know who they are
I was the b-ball playing, fly rhyme saying
Fly girl getting but never was I sweating
'Cause when it came to honeys I would go on a stroll
Until I met my match—her name was Flo
Yeah, I messed around with the one called Flo
All the troopers 'round the way used to call her a ho
But deep down in my heart I knew that Flo was good to go
'Cause I thought it was me like Bell Biv Devoe
But little did I know that she was playing with my mind
The only thing I learned is good girls are hard to find
I feel like Heavy D, I need somebody for me
Not someone whose mind is blank and tryna juice me for my banks
Swinging with my main man Lucky behind my back
What type of crap is that—yo, how's about a smack?
Word life, I can't front, thought I was all that
But now it seems, I've met my match
I was a stone cold lover, you couldn't tell me jack
Settling down with one girl, wasn't trying to hear that
I had Tonya, Tamika, Sharon, Karen
Tina, Stacy, Julie, Tracy
Used to love 'em, leave 'em, skeeze 'em, tease 'em
Find 'em, lose 'em - also abuse 'em
My whole attitude was new day, next hon
And believe it or not, they all got done
Well here comes Flo with the crazy whip appeal
And I'm all true man like Alexander O'Neal
Is this really love, then again how would I know
After all this time trying to be a super ho
She finally played me, but yo I'd find another
'Cause I got the crazy game and yo, I'm smooth like butter

It's like butter, like the butter baby
Not no Parkay, not no margarine
Strictly butter, strictly butter, baby

I remember when girls were goodie two shoes but now they turned to freaks
All of a sudden (we love you Phife!) ease off ho, my name's Malik
Phife this, Phife that, where you going, where you at
These girls don't know me from jack, yet I feel like the Mack
You didn't want me then, so yo hon, don't want me now
Here, Here - take the towel, wipe off your brow
And take the contact out your eye, you're far from looking fly
You get an E for effort, and T for nice try
Now tell me what's the reason, for dying your hair
Slum village gold still dangling in your ear
You barely have a neck but still sporting a rope
Four-finger ring just so Phifer can scope
You looked in the mirror, didn't know what to do
Yesterday your eyes were brown but today they are blue
Your whole appearance is a lie and it could never be true
And if you really liked yourself then you would try and be you
If your hair and eyes were real, I wouldn't have dissed ya
But since it was bought, I had to dismiss ya
But if you can't achieve it, then why not try and weave it
If you can't extend it then you might as well suspend it
If you can't braid it, best thing to do is fade it
I asked who did your hair and you tell me, ""Diane made it""
If you were you and just you, talk to you, maybe
But I can't stand, no bionic lady
Trying hard to look fly, but yo, you're looking dumber
If I wanted someone like you I would've swung with Jaime Sommers
You wanna be treated right, see Father MC
Or check Ralph Tresvant, for sensitivity
'Cause I am not the one, I got more game than Parker Brothers
Phife Dawg is on the mic and I'm smooth like butter19Embed",https://images.genius.com/44b3a90b2fcd09c5df186054d02c2817.545x545x1.png

Y'all know me, still the same OG
But I been low-key
Hated on by most these niggas
With no cheese, no deals and no G's
No wheels and no keys
No boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me, 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hangin' up in the office and back at my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Hoe, please
You better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's, and D.O.C.'s
The Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said, ""Motherfuck the police!""
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doin' too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggas that said that I turned pop or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been gettin' no sleep
So fuck y'all, all of y'all!
If y'all don't like me, blow me!

Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (Yup)
Just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walkin' by
With a Walkman on, when I caught a guy
Gave me an awkward eye ('Chu lookin' at?)
And strangled him up in the parking lot with his Karl Kani
I don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
I'm harder than me tryna park a Dodge
When I'm drunk as fuck
Right next to a humongous truck in a two-car garage
Hoppin' out with two broken legs tryna walk it off
Fuck you too, bitch, call the cops
I'ma kill you and them loud-ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs
And when the cops came through
Me and Dre stood next to a burnt-down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (Right here!)
So from here on out, it's the Chronic II
Startin' today and tomorrow's anew
And I'm still loco enough to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
Chicka-chicka-chicka Slim Shady
Hotter than a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up
When the temp goes up to the mid-80s

But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me
Like it was some disease, but you won't get a crumb from me
'Cause I'm from the streets of C-Compton! (Compton!)

All 'em little gangstas, who you think helped mold 'em all?
Now you wanna run around talkin' 'bout guns like I ain't got none
What, you think I sold 'em all
'Cause I stay well off?
Now all I get is hate mail all day sayin' Dre fell off

With a pen and a pad tryin' to get this damn label off?

It ain't gon' be nothin' after that

Oh for sho'

Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
'Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How? Nigga, my last album was The Chronic (Nigga)
They wanna know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they wanna know how I feel about it

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still puffin' my leaves, still fuck with the beats
Still not lovin' police (Huh-uh)

My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I'm 'sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat

Whether you're coolin' on the corner wit' your fly bitch (Biatch)
Laidback in the shack, play this track
I'm representin' for the gangstas all across the world
Still (Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl)
I'll break your neck, damn near put your face in your lap
Niggas try to be the king, but the ace is back
(So if you ain't up on thangs)
Dr. Dre be the name (What?), still runnin' the game
Still got it wrapped like a mummy
Still ain't trippin', love to see young blacks get money
Spend time out the hood, take they moms out the hood
Hit my boys off with jobs, no more livin' hard (Nah, nah)
Barbeques every day, drivin' fancy cars (Hey, hey)
Still gon' get mine regardless (Still)
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.
I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hittin' them corners in them low-lows, girl
Still takin' my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.

Right back up in your mothafuckin' ass
9-5 plus four pennies, add that shit up
D.R.E. right back up on top of thangs
Smoke some wit' your Dogg
No stress, no seeds, no stems, no sticks!
Some of that real sticky-icky-icky
Ooh wee! Put it in the air!
Well, you's a fool, D-R

One, two, three and to the four
Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door
Ready to make an entrance so back on up
'Cause you know we're 'bout to rip shit up
Give me the microphone first, so I can bust like a bubble
Compton and Long Beach together, now you know you in trouble
Ain't nothin' but a ""G"" thang, baby
Two loced out niggas goin' crazy
Death Row is the label that pays me
Unfadeable so please don't try to fade this (Hell yeah)
But, um, back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected, so I'ma let 'em understand
From a young G's perspective
And before me dig out a bitch, I have to find a contraceptive
You never know, she could be earnin' her man and learnin' her man
And at the same time burnin' her man
Now, you know I ain't with that shit, Lieutenant
Ain't no pussy good enough to get burnt while I'm up in it (Yeah)
And that's realer than Real-Deal Holyfield
And now you hookers and hoes know how I feel
Well, if it's good enough to get broke off a proper chunk
I'll take a small piece of some of that funky stuff

It's like this and like that and like this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—

Dre, creep to the mic like a phantom

Well, I'm peepin' and I'm creepin' and I'm creepin'
But I damn near got caught 'cause my beeper kept beepin'
Now it's time for me to make my impression felt
So sit back, relax, and strap on your seat belt
You never been on a ride like this before
With a producer who can rap and control the micstro
At the same time with the dope rhyme that I kick
You know and I know, I flow some old funky shit
To add to my collection, the selection
Symbolizes dope, take a toke, but don't choke
If you do, you'll have no clue
Of what me and my homie Snoop Dogg came to do

It's like this and like that and like this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode
You've got the feeling
Rock the other side
You've got the feeling (Yeah, yeah)

Fallin' back on that ass with a hellafied gangster lean
Gettin' funky on the mic like a old batch of collard greens
It's the capital S, oh, yes, I'm fresh, N-double-O-P
D-O-double-G-Y, D-O-double-G, you see
Showin' much flex when it's time to wreck a mic
Pimpin' hoes and clockin' a grip like my name was Dolemite
Yeah, and it don't quit
I think they in the mood for some motherfuckin' G shit (Hell yeah)
So, Dre (What up, Dogg?)
Gotta give 'em what they want (What's that, G?)
We gotta break 'em off somethin' (Hell yeah)
And it's gotta be bumpin' (City of Compton)
Is where it takes place, so when asked, your attention
Mobbin' like a motherfucker but I ain't lynchin'
Droppin' the funky shit that's makin' the sucker niggas mumble
When I'm on the mic, it's like a cookie, they all crumble
Try to get close and your ass'll get smacked
My motherfuckin' homie Doggy Dogg has got my back
Never let me slip, 'cause if I slip, then I'm slippin'
But if I got my nina, then you know I'm straight trippin'
And I'ma continue to put the rap down, put the mack down
And if you bitches talk shit, I have to put the smack down
Yeah, and you don't stop
I told you I'm just like a clock when I tick and I tock
But I'm never off, always on to the break of dawn
C-O-M-P-T-O-N and the city they call Long Beach
Puttin' the shit together
Like my nigga D.O.C., no one can do it better

Like this, that and this and a—
It's like that and like this and like that and a—
It's like this, and who gives a fuck about those?
So just chill 'til the next episode

I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
I told the world, one day I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Doubts startin' to creep in, every day, it's just so gray and black
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me you lost a son
Demons fightin' you, it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
Not the slightest clue
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
But you're either gettin' lazy or you don't believe in you no more
Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin' yourself
Second guessin' and it's almost like you're beggin' for my help
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin' be my mentor
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me when everyone was tellin' you
Don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I can never repay you, what you did for me is way more
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I'm runnin' out of time
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
Bring me back to life
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life

It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
You gon' see us in our lab jackets and ask where the fuck we been?
You can kiss my indecisive ass crack, maggots
And the cracker's ass, little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack math, backwards producers; I'm back, bastards
One more CD and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin', I'll guarantee they'll scream:

What's the difference between me and you?
What's the difference between me and you?

Back when Cube was rollin' with Lorenzo in a Benzo
I was bangin' with a gang of instrumentals
Got the pens and pencils, got down to business
But sometimes, the business end of this shit can turn your friends against you
But you was a real nigga, I could sense it in you
I still remember the window of the car that you went through
That's fucked up, but I'll never forget the shit we been through
And I'ma do whatever it takes to convince you
'Cause you my nigga, Doc, and Eazy, I'm still wit' you
Fuck the beef, nigga, I miss you, and that's just being real wit' you
You see, the truth is, everybody wanna know how close me and Snoop is
And who I'm still cool with
Then, I got these fake-ass niggas I first blew with
Claimin' they nonviolent, talkin' like they— (Do not resist the beat)
Spit venom in interviews, speakin' on reunions
Move units, then talk shit, and we can do this
Until then, I ain't even speakin' your name
Just keep my name out of your mouth, and we can keep it the same, nigga
It ain't that I'm too big to listen to the rumors
It's just that I'm too damn big to pay attention to 'em
That's the difference

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
Yo, I stay with it, while you try to perpetrate, play with it
Never knew about the next level until Dre did it (Yeah)
I stay committed while you motherfuckers babysitted
I smash the critics like a overhand right from Riddick (Yeah)
Come and get it, shitted on villains by the millions
I be catchin' bitches while bitches be catchin' feelings
So what the fuck am I supposed to do?
I pop bottles and hot hollow-points at each and all of you (Come on!)
A heartless bastard, high and plastered
My style is like the reaction from too much acid—never come down!
Pass it around if you can't handle it
Hang Hollywood niggas by they Soul Train laminates
What's the difference between me and you? (What?)
About five bank accounts, three ounces, and two vehicles
Until my death, I'm Bangladesh
I suggest you hold your breath 'til ain't none left
Yo, that's the difference!
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do

What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions

A'ight, hold up, hold up!
Stop the beat a minute! I got somethin' to say, Dre
I wanna tell you this shit right now while this fuckin' weed is in me (What the fuck?)
I don't know if I ever told you this
But I love you, dog, I got your motherfuckin' back (Right), just know this shit
Slim, I don't know if you noticed it
But I've had your back from day one, nigga, let's blow this bitch
I mean it, dog—you ever need somebody offed: ""Whose throat is it?""
Well, if you ever kill that Kim bitch, I'll show you where the ocean is
Well, that's cool, and I appreciate the offer
But if I do decide to really murder my daughter's mama
I'ma sit her up in the front seat and put sunglasses on her
And cruise around with her for seven hours through California
And have her wavin' at people (Hi!)
Then drop her off on the corner at the police station
And drive off, honkin' the horn for her (*Beep-beep!*)
Raw-dog, get your arm gnawed off
Drop the sawed-off and beat you with the piece it was sawed off of
Fuck blood, I wanna see some lungs coughed up
Get shot up in the hot tub 'til the bubbles pop up
In they nose and cough snot up, mucus and hot water
That's for tryna talk like The Chronic was lost product
That's for even thinkin' of havin' them thoughts thought up
And you better show some respect whenever the Doc's brought up
So what's the difference between us? We can start at the penis
Or we can scream, ""I just don't give a fuck!"" and see who means it
What's the difference between me and you?
You talk a good one, but you don't do what you supposed to do
I act on what I feel and never deal with emotions
I'm used to livin' big-dog-style and straight coastin'
What's the difference between me and you?

Doc, doc, you gotta give us some good news
(Yeah, about that…)
Don't let me find out the bitch in you
Don't let me find out the snitch in you
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself
Doctor's orders
Listen, this is my evaluation
This shit oversaturated, y'all can get evacuated
Kids sippin' Actavis and they ain't even activated
Married to the Internet, stuck in place, salivatin'
Ain't nobody graduatin'
Don't nobody love this shit the way I love it
That's why I gotta hate it
Everybody out for fame, that ain't no exaggeration
Damn, I'm gettin' aggravated
Fuck, I'm gettin' agitated
Teachers so underpaid in these fuckin' schools
The police got our name in all they databases
Girls be thirteen actin' twenty-two
Niggas be forty-four actin' half they ages
Somebody tell me, what the fuck is goin' on?
These niggas in tight shit, I'm in the fuckin' Matrix
It's lookin' like a sign of the revelation
'Bout time of the return of the fuckin' greatest
I got all these patients, man
How come they ain't patient with me?
They just think I want the money
Why? When I can't take it with me
Y'all don't do it for the love, for the love not
They gon' find out who you are
Just admit it 'fore you get admitted

Say, what you livin' about? (Fuck you gon' tell me?)
Do you remember where you started out though?
You're lookin' lost now (You want a pass? Oh, damn!)
Fake it 'til you make it, take your little paper
But when you look in the mirror your credibility’s gone now
I'd rather be hated on for who I am
Than to be loved for who I'm not, that's word to Doc
Fame and fortune is not your forte
Fuck the world now, I'm done with foreplay
Doctor's orders: go fuck yourself
Take two of these in the mornin', overdose and kill yourself
In the beginning a few of the people who had a problem I was this good scoffed, I just shook off
Prob'ly reminded you of the first time you saw Tiger Woods golf
Never thought about how much my race and nationality meant
But based on how I ascended
See how plain it was now, they want me to jet
But no one really gave a fuck about my descent, 'til I took off
Mistook me because I looked soft
But I stood tall, I just followed the Doctor's orders
So I rose and grew balls, told these hoes to screw off
Decided opposing you is what I'm ‘posed to do, all's
I did was say what I'm feeling when the vocal booth calls
And had you on pins and needles when I spoke to you all
You felt my pain, it's almost like I poked voodoo dolls
And I hope my spirit haunts the studios when I'm gone
My picture jumps off a poster and just floats through the halls
And fuckin' goes through the walls like the ghost of Lou Rawls
Karma's headed for Armageddon
The drama setter, I'm going in, already got an arm and head in
Whoever said words are just words ain't heard me word 'em
I give a fuck if my image even ends up taking a personal hit
Whoever I hurt or whatever bridges I burned in this bitch
And whatever bitches feel like they didn't deserve what they get
And whatever consequences come with every verse
It's worth it, so Doc, turn the beat on
Whose turn is it to get murdered on it?
And here's to all the years I spent toein' a line to overtime
As sure as a mole is blind
In my mind I'm still underground as a groundhog
And I'ma go for mine, like a whole furrow just tryna dig up some gold and diamonds and coal to find
No signs of slowin', these lines are my 9's
I just load up the most rhymes and open fire with a closed mind
All I needed was someone to co-sign
Been a Doctor's assault rifle
With the sniper scope for this whole time
Day one, say when to blast, just give me the order, I spray (uh)
Pain in the ass, you'll get shot in the ass with a paint gun
Ain't no one safe from, non-believers there ain't none
I even make the bitches I rape cum
I'm waitin' on someone to say somethin'
Dre, make the bass pump!
And let the tape run for old time's sake!
I spit it straight through, this is take one
The moment you're waitin' for has come, but the—
Fame and fortune is not your forte

Let me ride, just another homicide
Yeah, it's me so I'ma talk on
Stompin' on the easiest streets that you can walk on
So strap on your Compton hat, your locs
And watch your back 'cause you might get smoked, loc
And pass the bud and stay low-key

Now understand this, my nigga Dre can't be touched
Luke's bending over so Luke's gettin' fucked, buster
Must've thought I was sleazy
Or thought I was a mark 'cause I used to hang with Eazy
Animosity made you speak what you spoke (Yeah)
Ayo, Dre (What up?), chip this nigga off, loc
If it ain't another ho that I gots to fuck with
Gap teeth in your mouth, so my dick's gots to fit
With my nuts on your tonsils
While you're on stage rappin' at your wack-ass concert
And I'ma snatch your ass from the backside
And show you how Death Row pull off that who-ride
Now you might not understand me
'Cause I'ma rob you in Compton and blast you in Miami
Then we gon' creep to South Central
On a street knowledge mission as I steps in the temple
Spot him, got him, as I pulls out my strap
Got my chrome to the side of his White Sox hat
You tryna check my homie, you best check yourself
'Cause when you diss Dre you diss yourself, motherfucker (Yeah, nigga)
So I don't want no dilapidated, two-faced, pigeon-toed, bow-legged, cross-eyed son of a gun fuckin' with me
Yeah, nine-deuce
Dr. Dre droppin' chronic once again
It don't stop
Punishin' punk motherfuckers real quick-like
Compton style, nigga
Doggy Dogg's in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, Long Beach is in the motherfuckin' house
Yeah, yeah, straight up (Death Row is in the house, yeah)
Really, though
Breaking all them suckas off something real proper-like
You know what I'm sayin'?
All them sucker-ass niggas can eat a fat dick
Yeah, Eazy-E, Eazy-E, Eazy-E can eat a big fat dick
Tim Dog can eat a big fat dick

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts, then suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts, then suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run

I used to know a bitch named Eric Wright
We used to roll around and fuck the hoes at night
Tighter than a motherfucker with the gangster beats
And we was ballin' on the motherfuckin' Compton streets, peep
The shit got deep and it was on
Number one song after number one song
Long as my motherfuckin' pockets was fat
I didn't give a fuck where the bitch was at
But she was hangin' with a white bitch, doin' the shit she do
Suckin' on his dick just to get a buck or two
And the few ends she got didn't mean nothin'
Now she's suin' 'cause shit that she be doin' ain't shit
Bitch can't hang with the streets, she found herself short
So now she takin' me to court
It's real conversation for your ass
So recognize and pass to Daz
You might also like
Now as I'm rollin' with my nigga Dre and Eastwood
Fuckin' hoes, clockin' dough, up to no good
We flip-flop and serve hoes like flapjacks
(But we don't love them hoes) Bitch, and it's like that
This is what you look for in a ho who got cash flow
You run up in them hoes and grab the cash and get your dash on
While you're chillin' with your homies and shit
And how my niggas kick the anthem like this (Biatch)

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts, then suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run

To the store to get me a 4-0
Snoop Doggy Dogg paged, that must mean more hoes
So I head down the streets to Long Beach
Just, so I could meet a freak
To lick me from my head to my feet
And I'm here, now I'm ready to be done up
Nothin' but homies around, so I puts my gun up
Bitches on my nuts like clothes, hah
But I'm from Tha Pound and we don't love them hoes
How could you trust a ho? (Why?) 'Cause a ho's a trick
I don't love them tricks (Why?) 'cause a trick's a bitch
And my dick's constantly in her mouth
Turnin' them trick-ass hoes the fuck out now
I once had a bitch named Mandy May
Used to be all in them guts like every day
The pussy was the bomb, had a nigga on sprung
I was in love like a motherfucker, lickin' the pearl tongue
The homies used to tell me that she wasn't no good
But I'm the maniac in black, Mr. Snoop Eastwood
So I figured niggas wouldn't trip with mine
Guess what? Got gaffled by one-time
I'm back to the motherfuckin' county jail
Six months on my chest, now it's time to bail
Uh, I gets released on a hot sunny day
My nigga D.O.C. and my homie Dr. Dre
Scoop in a coupe, ""Snoop, we got news
Your girl was trickin' while you was draped in your county blues""
I ain't been out a second
And already gotta do some motherfuckin' chin-checkin'
Move up the blocks as we groove up the block
See my girl's house, ""Dre, pass the Glock""
Kick in the door, I look on the floor
It's my lil' cousin Daz and he's fuckin' my ho, yo
(Bitches ain't shit) I un-cock my shit
I'm heartbroke but I'm still loc'ed, man, fuck a bitch

Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts, then suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit but hoes and tricks
Lick on these nuts and suck the dick
Gets the fuck out after you're done
Then I hops in my coupe to make a quick run
Bitches ain't shit
Ooh, yeah, oh-oh, yeah
I don't give a fuck about a bitch (Bitches ain't shit)
But I'll let her know that she can't fade this
'Cause I'm doin' my own thing (Bitches ain't shit)
Down with the swang (Sing to these hoes)
I'm hangin' with Death Row like it ain't no thang
I say you know you can't deal (Bitches ain't shit, Death Row)
'Cause I'm a bitch that's real
Motherfuckers need to step back
Hell yeah, they need to chill (Tell these motherfuckers)
Because I don't give a fuck (Bitches ain't shit), and I don't give a fuck
And I don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck (Tell these motherfuckers)
And now I gotta do some—
I gotta do some shit that's clean (Bitches ain't shit)
But when I'm on the dick, hell yeah, I get real mean, hah
Like a washing machine, I can wash the clothes
All the hoes knows that I'm on the floor, ho (Bitches ain't shit)
But they can't hang with my type of swang
I ain't tryna say I suck every ding-a-lang
But just the juicy ones with the tip of the tongue
And then they're sprung and with their nuts hung

Where you from, nigga?
(Help me!)

""What is going on in Compton? I don't understand it.""
""Well as it relates to this, this is not in my field as the clerk so anything that relates to this, you'll probably have to get an answer from Dr. Dre.""

I heard you talking about respect, I gave you niggas the utmost
All you niggas the utmost
Would you look over Picasso's shoulder
And tell him 'bout his brush strokes?
Them opinions, I don't trust those
I apologize, the city made a nigga so cutthroat
Every hood love me, but it started on one coast
Could've stopped in '86 but I knew that you would want more
I'm on the throne in a place some niggas won't go

(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!)

Psst! This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific (The Pacific), representin'
Where them sharks at, nigga, down in the deep water

Listen, listen, listen, all you niggas swimming in the info
Go fuck around and drown in the specifics
Always going overboard, used to be my kinfolk
Now you sleeping with the motherfuckin' fishes
(Swimming with the mothefuckin' fishes, what the business?)
These niggas won't let up until they all wet up
(Don't get it fucked up!) Naw, nigga!
Now everybody wanna visit tryna re-up that prescription
(That prescription, yep, yeah, re-up)
That's my nigga, watercolors couldn't even paint the picture
If they don't get the picture, fuck them
Yeah, drugs by the dozen
You might just wanna go and check the children
(You might just wanna check your fuckin' children)
I'm the one that got they ear
Ah, for many years, I been making parents live in fear
I just wanna make it clear: My influence run deep like the ocean

(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
But I ain't been gone that long
(All they wanna know is: where you from? Where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton!)

Feels like you're drowning, don't you?
About a hundred miles down in that ocean
It's over, shoulda never jumped in
If you can't swim (If you can't swim, if you can't swim)
Oh my God, where's a lifeguard when you need one?
Motherfucker know I started from the bottom, vodka baby bottle
Mixin' that with Similac, my momma knew I had a problem
Wasn't thinking 'bout no rapping, I was juuging for a dollar
Putting quarter pieces in the black Caprice and make it holla
No policing me, I got the beast in me, I gotta holla
Keep the decency and make them TNT my product
I'm a C-O-M-P-T-O-innovator, energizer
Inner city bullet flyin' 'til that bitch on auto pilot
Ah, shit! I don't give a fuck about your whereabouts
All I care about is wearing out your area
And airing out your upper body
When I catch ya walking out your parents' house
(Don't get it fucked up!) Homie got fucked up
Tryna park his tour bus, not knowing what's what
Or who's who, living in the L.A. County zoo
Pick them off like a big dog, motherfucker, woof!
Once upon a time, I shot a nigga on accident (Boom, boom, boom)
I tried to kill him but I guess I needed more practicing (Boom, boom, boom)
That's when I realized banging wasn't for everybody
Switch it up before my enemy or the sheriff got me
They liable to bury him, they nominated six to carry him
They worry him to death, but he no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium
(Don't get it fucked up!) Been away from home
Been away from home all night long
(All they wanna know is: where you from?
Where you from, nigga, huh? Compton)

This is about where I'm from
I think it's time to take these niggas to the deep water
Yeah, down in the Pacific
Where them sharks at, nigga, down in the deep water
Help me
(Feels like you're drowning)
I'm drowning
Help me, help me, help me
Somebody help me
(Shoulda never jumped in
If you, if you can't swim)
Help me
Help me, help me, help me
I can't, I can't breathe
I can't breathe, help

My nigga-ish ways attract girls that used to turn they back
Causing me to yank they arm and pose like I would do them harm
Now I'm saying ""Thank you"" 'cause they tell me my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive
For my niggas drinking Cognac, smoking weed, always pack
More than one firearm, chrome rims, riding on
Chronic in your system, let me know my shit's the bomb
Xxplosive

West Coast shit, nigga
Over-dosage, imperial pistols ferocious
Fuck a bitch, don't tease, bitch, striptease, bitch
Eat a bowl of these, bitch, gobble a dick
Hoes forgot to eat a dick and shut the fuck up (Fuck up, bitch)
Gobble and swallow a nut up, shut up and get my cash (Cash)
Backhanded, pimp-slapped backwards, and left stranded
Just pop your collar, pimp convention, hoes for a dollar
Six-Deuce in a plush, six-deuce Impala
Pimping hoes from Texas to Guatemala
Bitch niggas pay for hoes (Hoes) just to lay with hoes (Hoes)
Relax one night and pay to stay with hoes (Hoes)
Captain Save-'Em-All-Day (Bitch), well, save this dick

You into hitting bitches off with a grip, you punk bitch

I got these freaky hoes clapping they hands, stomping they feet
Every now and then, they put they mouth on me
Nowadays, a G like me can't even call it
A 23-year-old pussy fiend and freakaholic
Pimping bitches on the regular, I put that on the G
A hustler and a player: nowadays, it pays to be
Let me drop some shit about this bitch I used to know
She gave your boy the head and said, ""Don't let nobody know""
A bona fide pro, I had to grab the ho
She got freaky in your '64, I skeeted in her throat
Been knowin' the ho for four days, pimpery pays
And I bet you didn't know that she go both ways
She ate her best friend, I left them hoes at the Mo'
They be beeping me and shit, but we don't kick it no more
Them hot hoes is fiending, they on the nuts
But bitch, I'm out your pussy when I nut, for real

Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Times is changin', young niggas is agin'
Becoming OG's in the game and changin'
To make way for these new names and faces
But the strangest things can happen from rappin'
When niggas get wrapped up in image and actin'
Niggas get capped up and wrapped in plastic
Zipped up in bags—when it happens, that's it
I've seen 'em come, I've watched 'em go
Watched 'em rise, witnessed it, and watched 'em blow
Watched 'em all blossom and watched 'em grow
Watched the lawsuits when they lost the dough
Best friends and money: I lost 'em both
Went and visited niggas in the hospital
It's all the same shit all across the globe
I just sit back and watch the show (The watcher)

'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I'm watching)

I moved out of the hood for good—you blame me?
Niggas aim, mainly, at niggas they can't be
But niggas can't hit niggas they can't see
I'm out of sight now, I'm out of they dang reach
How would you feel if niggas wanted you killed?
You'd probably move to a new house on a new hill
And choose a new spot, if niggas wanted you shot
I ain't a thug—how much 2Pac in you you got?
I ain't no bitch, neither
It's either my life or your life and I ain't leavin', I like breathin'
'Cause nigga, we can go round for round
Clip for clip—shit, four-pound for pound
Nigga, if you really want to take it there, we can
Just remember that you fuckin' with a family man
I got a lot more to lose than you
Remember that when you wanna come and fill these shoes (The watcher)

'Cause everywhere that I go
Ain't the same as befo' (The watcher)
People I used to know
Just don't know me no mo' (The watcher)
But everywhere that I go
I got people I know (The watcher)
Who got people they know
So I suggest you lay low (I'm watching)
Things just ain't the same for gangstas
Cops is anxious to put niggas in handcuffs
They wanna hang us, see us dead, or enslave us
Keep us trapped in the same place we was raised in
Then, they wonder why we act so outrageous
Run around stressed out and pull out gauges
'Cause every time you let the animal out cages
It's dangerous to people who look like strangers
But now, we got a new era of gangstas
Hustlers and youngsters livin' amongst us
Lookin' at us now, callin' us busters
Can't help but reminisce back when it was us
Nigga, we started this gangsta shit!
And this the motherfuckin' thanks I get?

Hit this motherfucker, G
No, naw, man, I can't fuck with that
Aw, man, I been dealin' with you for three motherfuckin' months, you ain't hit the pipe in front of me yet!
So, what you sayin'?
I think you 5-0!
5-0? Man, I ain't no motherfuckin' cop!
Well, hit this motherfucker then
(Lights pipe)

(""I can feel it!"")

Tonight's the night I get in some shit (Yeah)
Deep cover, on the incognito tip
Killin' motherfuckers if I have to, peelin' caps, too
Let your niggas know I'm comin' at you
I guess that's part of the game
But I feel for the nigga who think he just gonna come and change things with the swiftness
So get it right with the quickness
And let me handle my business, yo
I'm on a mission, and my mission won't stop
Until I get the nigga maxin' at the top
I hope you get his ass 'fore he drop
Kingpin, kickin' back while his workers slang his rocks
Comin' up like a fat rat
Big money, big cars, big bodyguards on his back
So it's difficult to get him
But I got the hook up with somebody who knows how to get in contact with him
Hit him like this and like that
Let him know that I'm lookin' for a big, fat dope sack
With ends to spend, so let's rush it
If you want to handle it tonight, we'll discuss it
On a nigga's time, and a nigga's place
Take my strap just in case one of his boys recognize my face
'Cause he's a sheisty motherfucker
But I gives a fuck, 'cause I'm goin' deep cover

Maniac, lunatic, call him ""Snoop Eastwood""
Kickin' dust as I bust, fuck peace, and
The motherfuckin' punk police
You already know I gives a fuck about a cop
So why in the fuck would you think that it would stop?
Plot, yeah, that's what we's about to do
Take your ass on a mission with the boys in blue
Dre! (What up, Snoop?) Yo, I got the feelin'
Tonight's the night, like Betty Wright, man, I'm chillin'
Killin', feelin' no remorse, yeah
So let's go straight to the motherfuckin' source
And see what we can find
Crooked-ass cops that be gettin' niggas a gang of time
And now, they wanna make a deal with me
Scoop me up and put me on they team and chill with me
And make my pockets bigger
They want to meet with me tonight at seven o'clock (So, what's up, nigga?)
What you wanna do? (What you wanna do?)
I got the gauge, a Uzi, and my motherfuckin' twenty-two
So, if you wanna blast, nigga, we can buck 'em
If we stick 'em, then we stuck 'em, so fuck 'em!

Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop
Yeah, and you don't stop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop

Six-four-five was the time on the clock
When me and my homie bailed in the parking lot
The scene looked strange, and it felt like a setup
Bet' not be, 'cause if it is, they gettin' lit up!
Oh, here they come from the back in they 'Lacs
I'm checkin' for they gats, they strapped; so what's up, black?
Chill, let's hear the deal
If it ain't up to what you feel, then grab your steel
Right, so, what you motherfuckers gon' come at me with?
Hope you ain't wantin' none of my grip
'Cause you can save that shit (Guess what they told me?)
""We'll give you 20 G's if you snitch on your homie
We'll put you in a home, and make your life plush
Oh, yeah, but you got to sell dope for us""
""Hmmm, let me think about it""
Turned my back and grabbed my gat
And guess what I told him 'fore I shot him?
If you don't quit, yeah
If you don't stop, yeah
I'm lettin' my gat pop
'Cause it's 1-8-7 on a undercover cop!
Yeah, and you don't stop

Where you at? Where you from?
Whatcha doing over here, motherfucker?
Whatcha think? What you bang?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game
Now I ain't never been no gangsta
But I know niggas, know niggas from the darkside
There's some cold killas, cold killas (My man, he used to tell me)
""My nigga, you should roll with us, roll with us"" (Every night)
Married to the more money, more women
Now I ain't ever been the one that'll pull a gun on you
But I know who got 'em
No, I never sold no drugs, homie
But I know who got 'em
And I never had no fucking bullets in me
But I know who got 'em
Mmmmm, heeeey-heeeeeey
If you die tonight, you die tonight
Momma might cry tonight if she find you high off the dynamite
But to you, well, it's just another Friday night
Got a nigga feeling kinda nice
With the Bible right beside that pile of white
That's what this life is like
(Now do you love your life?)

Now please don't give me a reason, reason
'Cause I know you wanna keep breathing this evening
I've been killing the game for seasons, believe him
That I'm the motherfuckin' one to breed them and lead 'em
In a league of my own
You ain't even made it up to my throne
You ain't even authorized for this song
Might be best for you to get goin'
Best be careful about your tone
That shit can hit me wrong and it's on
I have tried my best to be calm
Please don't make me grab that phone (Uh-oh)
Now who you know who came this fucking far
From the fucking bottom?
Thirty years in this bitch and I'm still here
Decade after decade
And evidently I must be doing somethin' right
Word to my nigga Eazy
Eazy-E C-P-T OG from the other side (Eazy)
From the other side (Eazy)

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone

I went from hanging out down at the swap meet
To driving some of the hottest cars L.A. has ever seen
People been tellin' me I've grown into some kind of monster
But they don't know me though, I've been this way since seventeen
Tryna get finances poppin', man, I thought that was the object
'Til some of my niggas lost they life and then there goes the team
My only dream was holding it down, like, fuck who tryna stop us
You could get the middle finger or the reddest beam
It's your choice, I took this industry by storm, young and black
Killing them softly
Don't ever call me fortunate, you don't know what it cost me
So anybody complaining about they circumstances lost me, homie
We ain't even talkin', fuck that energy, fuck up off me, ugh!

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it
You'll find out when I'm gone
You look at my lifestyle
I'm living my life now
I'm dealing with diligent Benjamin
How come my attitude piped down?
I'm fucking with Ice now
I'm fucking with shit that you only can get
On an oversea flight now
You scared of my heights now
But still, I got enemies giving me energy
I wanna fight now
Subliminal, sending me all of this hate
I thought I was holding the mic down
I thought I was holding my city up
I thought I was good in the media
You think I'm too hood in my video?
But really, no clue, you idiot
I just can't help myself
Even when that record spin
Every now and then, you hang yourself
'Cause I got the green and gold (With a million sold)
Plus plenty more, (and my dollar thicker)
But with or without the diamonds, though
(To you) I'm just another (Nigga!)

It's easy to say you need me
When you got everything you want
But It's hard for me to believe it

This one is for my brother, Tyree, R.I.P
A message to God
Since you finishing em early, what possessed you to start him?
We made a vow - later we'll regret til death do us part
Lord, I thought we was made for each other
You shouldn't connect those, made to be taken away from each other
Now what I'm supposed to do? I'm only half the man that I was
I'll never last, cause my better half is up there with you
You knew what you was doing when you made us, so with all due respect
You coulda forgave him, you didn't have to take him
He can take the game with him, cause he defines the word
The one who puts the G in it, who you think put me in it?
I'm feeling like my whole world is blinded, wondering why
Crying, pouring out my heart, pouring out liquor behind it
We fought like brothers, something we never should do
We coulda used time spent arguing telling the truth
He had talent too - I had plans on watching him blow
Don't know what hurts more, seeing him leave, or watching him go

Listen, listen, listen (Listen)
Listen, listen, listen (Better listen)
Listen, listen, listen

You's a soldier, you're probably packing heat up there
Met up with homies from the street, and got deep up there
If you only knew the way I felt before they ruined the crew
I thought I learned from Eazy, now I'm going through it with you
We lost a thug, a son, and a father
I spoke to your son, the other day, and told him Uncle Dre got him
The Lord must be accidentally pulling your file
Cause I'm still paging you, 911, straight in denial
Prayin' you get it, but no man can choose the card he was dealt
You either quit, or you gon' play it like you get it
I done been through all emotions, from in shock, to keeping a poker face
To straight breaking down and showing all emotions
I'm anxious to believing real G's don't cry
If that's the truth, then I'm realizing I ain't no gangsta
It's just not me, but you know I'mma always ride wit you
I miss you, sometimes I wish I just died with you

Been doin' drive-bys
Got this music industry timeline lookin' like Rosecrans
When these niggas throw up them signs high
I'm talking about that bottom, where it's high crimes
Shit, I’m just tryna get paid and keep them thighs high (Thighs high)
Sometimes, I feel like I could just bury ‘em, bury 'em
Cause delirium, mass hysteria, no scarier area
I'm very aware hip-hop needed something to carry it
So I married that bitch and swung down in that chariot
And you way too fuckin' close, beware the barrier
This is Hub City, nigga, don't make us embarrass you
Man, you should be realistic, these niggas 'round here ballistic
We did the numbers, and you looking like another statistic

I'ma ride until the dead has risen
Live in a project building, dodging the module ceilings
I ride, I'ma ride in a stolen Jeep
Ride with the eyes of five blind men, my vision (Corrupted)
Mama tried counseling, five plans for Kendrick (But fuck it)
My family ties had sabotaged Rosecrans existence (Abducted)
My aliens on surveillance, they paid me a visit (Disgusting)
Our stadium's packed, Raiders in black
Curls dripping, silver bullet, palladium in my strap
I lie on the side of a one-way street (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
Nowhere to go, death all I can see (Blow-blow-blow-blow!)
I say ""Fuck is up?"" I fuck 'em up
Your supper's up, and something's up
I hope he no can walk the tightest rope before the double-dutch
Broke plenty records with this weapon, I protect it under oath

Fuck your mama. fuck your daddy, fuck your dead homie

Word up son, word
Yeah, to all the killers and a hundred dollar billers
Yo I got the phone thing, know I'm sayin', keep your eyes open
For real niggas who ain't got no feelings
Keep your eyes open
No doubt, no doubt son, I got this, I got this
Just watch my back, I got the front, yo
Check it out now
Word up, say it to them niggas, check this out it's a murder

I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous
You heard of us, official Queensbridge murderers
The Mobb comes equipped for warfare, beware
Of my crime family who got 'nough shots to share
For all of those who wanna profile and pose
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone
You all alone in these streets, cousin
Every man for they self in this land we be gunnin'
And keep them shook crews runnin', like they supposed to
They come around, but they never come close to
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place
Cowards like you just get they whole body laced up
With bullet holes and such
Speak the wrong words, man, and you will get touched
You can put your whole army against my team and
I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'
Your simple words just don't move me
You're minor, we're major
You're all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player
Don't make me have to call your name out
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate
I'm only nineteen, but my mind is old
And when the things get for real, my warm heart turns cold
Another nigga deceased, another story gets told
It ain't nothin' really, ayo Dun, spark the Philly
So I can get my mind off these yellow-backed niggas
Why they still alive? I don't know, go figure
Meanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation
If I die, I couldn't choose a better location
When the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation
Gettin' closer to God in a tight situation now
Take these words home and think it through
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you
You might also like
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look

There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

For every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life
Yo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life
Ain't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration
You don't know me, there's no relation
Queensbridge and we don't play
I don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind
Son, I'm bigger than those
Claimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold
And once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome
Thirteen years in the projects—my mentality is what, kid?
You talk a good one, but you don't want it
Sometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?
Or am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?
No time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts
Front if you want, kid, lay on your back
I don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live
Stay in a child's place, kid, you out of line
Criminal minds thirsty for recognition
I'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'
I'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'
Get that loot, kid, you know my function
'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal
And once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples
React quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up
When I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'
Son, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
(We live the life that of diamonds)
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Scared to death, scared to look, they shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
Livin' the life that of diamonds and guns
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds
So some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns
Cowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones
He ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one

To all the villains and a hundred dollar billers
To real brothers who ain't got no feelings
G-yeah, the whole Bridge
Queens get the money

Yeah, sendin' this one out to my man Killa B
No doubt, indeed
Where that weed? Nahmsayin'?
That old real shit

There's a war goin' on outside no man is safe from
You could run, but you can't hide forever
From these streets that we done took
You walkin' with your head down, scared to look
You shook, ‘cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
They never around when the beef cooks in my part of town
It's similar to Vietnam
Now we all grown up and old, and beyond the cops' control
They better have the riot gear ready
Tryin' to bag me and get rocked steady!
By the MAC one-double, I touch you
And leave you with not much to go home with
My skin is thick, ‘cause I be up in the mix of action
If I'm not at home, puffin' lye, relaxin'
New York got a nigga depressed
So I wear a slug-proof underneath my Guess
God bless my soul
Before I put my foot down and begin to stroll
Into the drama I built
And all unfinished beef, you will soon be killed
Put us together — it's like mixin' vodka and milk
I'm goin out blastin', takin' my enemies with me
And if not, they scarred, so they will never forget me
Lord, forgive me, the Hennessy got me not knowin' how to act
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
Or maybe it's the words from my man Killa Black
That I can't say, so it's left a untold fact
Until my death, my goal's to stay alive
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

I'm trapped in between two worlds, tryin' to get dough
Y'know, when the dough get low, the juice go
But never that! As long as fiends smoke crack
I'll be on the block hustlin', countin' my stacks
No doubt, watchin' my back and proceed with caution
Five-O's lurkin', no time to get lost in the system
Niggas usin' fake names to get out quick
My brother did it and got bagged with two ounces
I live a world where squads hit the block hard
Ask my man Twin, when he got bagged, that fucked me up, God
But shit happens for a reason
You find out who's your true peoples when you're Upstate bleedin'
You can't find a shorty to troop your bid with you
Hit with a two-to-four is difficult
Wild on the streets, I try to maintain
Tight with my loot, ‘cause hoes like to run game
Some niggas like to trick, but I ain't with that trickin' shit
I'm like a Jew, savin' dough so I can big whip
Pushin' a Lex, now I'm set, ready to jet
No matter how much loot I get, I'm stayin' in the projects forever!
Jakes on the blocks — we out-clever
If beef, we never separate, roll together
When worst comes to worst, my peoples come first
Try to react and get them motherfuckin' feelings hurt
My crew's all about loot
Fuck lookin' cute! I'm strictly Timb boots and Army certified suits
Puffin' L's, laid back, enjoyin' the smell
In the 'Bridge, gettin' down, it ain't hard to tell
You better realize
Yo, yo, we livin' this 'til the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

We livin' this 'til the day that we die

Yo, the saga begins, begin war
I draw first blood, be the first to set it off
My cause, tap all jaws, lay down laws
We takin' what's yours, we do jux, rush the doors
Here come the D's, time to make breeze and guns toss
In full force, my team'll go at your main source
My 9 Taurus hit bosses and take hostage
Your whole setup, from the ground up, we lock shit
Blood flood your eye, fuck up your optics
Switch to killer instincts 'fore niggas pop shit
Yo, nigga Noyd, what's the topic?
Nine pound, we rocked it
'96, strike back with more hot shit
Illuminate, my team'll glow like radiation
With no time for patient or complication
Let's get it done right, my clique airtight
Trapped in a never-ending gunfight
So niggas lose stripes or lose life
Jail niggas sendin' kites to the street
Over some beef that wasn't fully cooked
Finish 'em off, well-done meat
Then send .22 slug to your head
Travel all the way down to your leg

Ayo, it's Hell on Earth
Whose necks are gonna be first?
The projects is front line
And the enemy is one-time
I ain't gotta tell you
It's right in front of your eyes

Adapt to gat sound and bow down

Articulate, hittin' body parts to start shiftin' shit
Never hesitant, it's the rap game unlimited
Sign my roster, we can do this, forever infinite
Then reminisce twenty years later how we was gettin' it
Either with me, go against the grain, you better hit me
Leggin' me or robbin' me, niggas better body me
‘Cause it's a small world and niggas talkin' like bitches
Bitches singin' like snitches, pointin' you out in pictures
‘Cause she rep the QBC faithfully, playa-hatin' me
All that bullshit is just makin' me
More the better to concentrate on gettin' cheddar
If shorty set you up, you better dead her
I told you, shape and mold you, son you, then I hold you
Like a pimp, mind control you, double-edge blow you
In the B-I like I'm supposed to, the clique is coastal
International, you local
Bacardi mix physically fix
Hit you with shit that'll leave a loose nigga stiff
Probably thick, son, I solved 'em
Pulled him in my world and evolved him to chaos
Walk the beat like around the way cops the average pitstop

Yo, the heavy metal king, hold big shit with spare clips
You see eclipse when the MAC spit, your top got split
Layin' dead with open eyes, close his eyelids
Turn off his lights, switch to darkness
It's deep in the abyss of street life
Blood on my kicks, shit on my knife
You's the wild child, Kicko turnin' men into mice
I was born to take power, leave my mark on this planet
The phantom of crime rap, niggas is left stranded
Shut down your operation, closed for business
Leave a foul taste in your mouth like Guinness
P.O.W. niggas is found M.I.A.
We move like special forces, Green Beret
Heavily around my throat, I don't play
Shit brand new, back in '89, the same way
The God P walk with a limp, see
But simply, to simplify shit, no man can go against me
Test me, you must be bent, G, don't tempt me
I had this full clip for so long, it needs to empty
The reason why it's full for so long 'cause I don't waste shit
You properly hit, blood in your mouth so you could taste it
Quiet is kept, I lay back and watch the world spin
I hear thugs claimin' that they gonna rob the Mobb when they see us
I tell you what, black, here's the issue
It's a package deal, you rob me, you take these missiles
Along with that, I ain't your average cat
Fuck rap, I'm tryna make cream and that's that
Whatever it takes, however it gots to go down
Four mics on stage, a motherfuckin' four-pound
Speakers leakin' out sound and niggas leakin' on the ground
I could truly care less, the God gon' get his regardless
Blow-for-blow, let's find out who hit hardest
This rap artist used to be a stickup artist
Sometimes I test myself, see if I still got it
A live nigga stay on point, never disregard shit
Or forget the essence from which I emerged
P is sick, so save that bullshit for the birds (Nigga)

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky
We in this together, son, your beef is mines

Let me start from the beginnin', at the top of the list
Know wha'mean, Hav? Situation like this
Another war story from a thirsty young hustler
Won't trust ya, I'd rather bust ya
And leave your corpse for the cops to discover
While I be pimpin' in the Range Rover, all jewelled like Liberace
You watch me while Jakes tryna knock me and lock me
But I be on the low sippin' Asti Spumante
Niggas tried to creep on the side of my Jeep
Stuck the heat through the window, rocked they ass to sleep
Over a 3-pack — it was a small thing really, yeah
But keep lettin' them small things slide and be a failure
If I'm outta town, one of my crew'll take care of ya
The world is ours, and your team's inferior
You wanna bust caps? I get all up in your area
Kidnap your children, make the situation scarier
Life is a gamble, we scramble for money
I might crack a smile, but ain't a damn thing funny
I'm caught up in the dirt where your hands get muddy
Plus, the outcome turns out to be lovely
Got cheese in my pocket, hit off my main squeeze
Push back the sunroof, let the cold air breeze
Through the butter-soft leather upholstery
But mostly, keep the gat closely 'cause niggas wanna toast me

A-yo, I gotta get mines, no matter what the consequences
Count all my blessings, add up my weapons
Cock back the gat and let my 9 serve purpose
Sling, do my thing, organize fiend servants
Tryna make a mill is stress, you know the deal
So we sling krills, get your cap peeled, 'cause everythin' is real
Cuz, I wanna chill, laid up in a Jacuzzi
Sippin' bubbly, with my fingers on the Uzi
Try to infiltrate my fort, get caught, dead up in New York
My brain is packed with criminal thoughts
Get your life lost, never found again, my friend
Mission completed, watch you drop in less than ten
On my road to the riches, hittin' snitches off with mad stitches
Your last restin' place'll be a ditch, kid!
No one can stop me — try, your style's sloppy
You wanna be me? You're just an imitation copy
My theme is all about makin' the green
Livin' up in luxury, pushin' phat whips and livin' comfortably

As time goes by, an eye for an eye
We in this together, son, your beef is mines
So long as the sun shines to light up the sky

A drug dealer's dream:
Stash C.R.E.A.M., ki's on a triple beam
500 SL green, '95 nickle gleam
Condominium, thug dressed like a gentleman
Tailor-made ostrich, Chanel for my woman friend
Murderin', numbers on your head while I'm burglarin'
Shank is servin' 'em
What's up to all my niggas swervin' in New York metropolis
The 'Bridge brings apocalypse
Shoot at the clouds, feels like the Holy Beast is watchin' us
Mad man, my sanity is goin' like a hourglass
Gun inside my bad hand I sliced tryna bag grams
I got hoes that used to milk you
Niggas who could've killed you is down with my ill crew of psychos
Nas Escobar movin' on your weak production
Pumpin' corruption in the third world, we just bustin'!

Hold up and analyze — the wild cats sling cracks, they swing in Ac's
The new routines be my eyes
Blacks playin' corners, glancin' all up in your cornea
Corner ya, seen cats snatch monies up on ya
But late night, candlelight fiend with a crack pipe
It's only right, feelin' higher than an airplane, right?
Word, yo, I wanna get this money then blow
Take my time, blast a nine, if you front, you go
Sip beers — the German ones, hand my guns to sons
Shaolin and Queensbridge — we robbin' niggas for fun
But still, write my will out to my seeds then build
Mahalia sing a tale, but the real, we still kill!

So niggas is forced to do dirt
And God made dirt, so this dirt won't hurt

The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em
It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em

Drop a gem on 'em, son
You know I got jewels, infinite, son
Yo

Yeah, likewise, tired of rap guys that's faggots
Yeah, P'll shut eyes and swole up your whole outside
I baptize, niggas get wet, hit up your backside
Get claptized and set straight, put on your head straight
Watch out for these upstate cats
Be leery of New Yiddy niggas with gats with the wall on they back
Rikers Island flashbacks of the house you got scufted in
You would think that gettin' your head shot's enough, but then
Now you wanna go at my team
Must have been drunk when you wrote that shit
Too bad you had to did it to your own self
My rebellion, retaliate
I had the whole New York state
Aimin' at your face at the gate
Bottom line off top soon as you came through
Shots flew, don't even know the half of my crew
I got a hundred strong-arm niggas ready to rock your shit
Clocks tick, your days are numbered in low digits
You look suspicious, suspect niggas is bitches
Get chopped up, Grade A meat, somethin' delicious
And laced back up, two G's worth of stitches
To reconstruct your face and learn how to speak again
My mob's like a bunch of wild Puerto Ricans
With bangers the size of African spears, it's warfare
In the arena, we turn arenas into house of horrors
It's Terrordome, when you see my clique, you need to run behind shit
You got a gat, you better find it
And use that shit, think fast and get reminded
Of robberies in Manhattan, you know what happened
Sixty G's worth of gun clappin'
Who shot ya?
You probably screamed louder than an opera
New York got ya
Now you wanna use my Mobb as a crutch
What you think, you can't get bucked again?
Once again
Back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems
The Mobb got the bomb, run out and tell a friend
Drop a gem on 'em
It's the infamous back in the house once again
Live the life, that of diamonds and guns and now gems
Pull gats like a basehead pull on stems

Word up, man! You know what I'm sayin'?
So I be tellin' these niggas, man! Shit ain't a game, man
(Tell 'em, dunn! Man, let them niggas know, man)
Shit is real, kid, word up! (Know what I'm sayin'?)
(Shit is definitely real, boy!)
Yeah! We tryna get this loot any way, man!

A-yo, Queens get the money, long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle where the guns go blast!
The fool retaliated, so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now, who the fuck you think is livin' to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said, ""Queens niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine, kid, stay outta my way""
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
But can't stop 'til I'm eatin' off a platinum plate
Po-po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever, but they can't deflate me
'Cause havin' cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to have no money to live with
I pause, step back, look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love, it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helpin' ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, plus a cellular
Yo, Big Noyd! (What up, cousin?!) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope

Yo, it's the R-A-double-P-E-R N-O-Y-D

You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally? Definitely!
To the death of me, come and test me
Trust me, nigga can't touch me if he snuffed me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, 'cause I'mma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born wit' it, I'm gettin' on wit' it
And I'mma have it 'til I'm fuckin' dead and gone wit' it!
'Cause I'm a what?! Composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, 'cause I'm a wild motherfucker!
You know I flow, you know my steelo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my P.O
Jump out my hooptie
Pass my gat and my lucci to my shorty, in case my P.O. try to troop me
To the Island, and if I start wildin'
Flippin' on niggas walkin' around with the nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped, see?
Back to Queens, pumpin' the fiends, makin' more C.R.E.A.M
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya! Pull out my fo'-fo' and bust ya!

Yo, ain't no time for fakin' jax
'Cause brothers that fake jax get laid on they backs
The streets is real, can't roll without steel
I feel how I feel 'cause I was born to kill
Do what I gotta to eat a decent meal, brothers is starvin'
Don't try to find a job, son, it's all about robbin'
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown, dude!
Off the map, 'cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealin', only mess with shorties that's appealin'
I'm frontin' on the world once I start 4-wheelin'
'Cause back on the 41st Side, we do it right
Sippin' E&J, gettin' bent all night
Yo, who that?! I never seen him in my whole life
Step to his business 'cause it's only right
Po-po ain't around, so I grab my pound
Money retaliated, so I hit the ground
My life is on the line, gotta hold my projects down
Can't see myself gettin' bodied by a clown
Ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest, now he's layin' man down
Jetted up from under the benches, I started hearin' sirens
I stopped firin', to cut ass like a diamond
Jetted to the crib piece, what a relief
Stashed the heat, then proceeded to peep
Out the window, called my son, ""Yo, son, we got beef!""
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him
I got my mind on a stick-up, now it's time to get paid
Thinkin' of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Gimme yours or get laid!
Give up the goods or get sprayed!

I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them outta-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up!
Caught up in the crossfire, get theyself hurt up
While I be sippin' gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real, but you nameless
First of all, slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothin' to play with
No jokes, no games, kid
For years, I been doin' the same shit
Just, drinkin' liquor, doin' bids
Extortin' crack heads, and stickin' up the stick-up kids!26Embed",https://images.genius.com/9c2fa45d611606aba6beada5971d7b32.665x665x1.jpg

You know what I'm sayin'?
I wanna say what's up to my man Louie — you know he's still here
Drop this one for you, you know?
And for those who don't know — The 41st Side

I keep it real, pack steel like my man YG
When a fool try to play me, wet him up then I'm Swayze
You must be crazy, kid
Ran? I never did
Forever wildin', that's how we live up in the 'Bridge
You just sit scared
Cock back the Gat, then hit a nigga like a bid
25? Nah, kid, you gettin' life
Forever burnin' in hell, niggas is trife!
It's the semi-auto, you can bring it on, yo
I'm pullin' out, strippin' niggas just like a porno flick
I'm sick, the Mobb rolls thick
Cross paths with my clique, and get vic!
I'm on some bullshit, that's how I was raised, G
Each level is a stage
Have you slidin' down blazin', pools of alcohol
Walk before you crawl
I'm in this to win this, you gonna take a fall
The Infamous Queensbridge — we on the scene, kid!
Creepin' on those who caught sleepin' — don't ever do that
I run with two MAC's, and plus my crew backs my every move
I choose givin' crews the blues
I'm open off the Dainy
Obey me, or get sprayed with the sweeper
'Cause I'm my brothers keeper
The Grim Reaper holdin' with nothin' but big batters and big heaters
Blow you three times, leave a mark like Adidas
Jig you, I know how to fix you
Pretty-boy niggas frontin' hard is the issue!
Word to my unborn — you get scolded, old and molded
When I get bent, you get folded
Every rhyme is the truth that I must get 'cross
Put you right on your back, take it to the source
No doubt, I'm stuck and I can't get out of this lifestyle
The 41st Side — get bent, run wild!
The 41st Side, too, you know how we do
Violate, motherfucker, I'mma see you
With the Linden, it's the start of your endin'
Settin' it again and again!

Give a big shoot out to my man Heavy L
Big Palms representin' from the Goodfellas

Yo, it's the P-E Double, push a Lex bubble in the winter
You can't come along, only the hoes can enter
Told her to meet me at six on the hill, at the center
Took her to the west way and bent her right over
Stay intoxicated, never sober
Faced it, violate and get lace'd
Why you wastin' slugs? You ain't buckin' nothin'
You better off buckin' yourself, you need to stop frontin'

Littles painted in black with crack sale intentions
To blow up the whole projects
The Infamous — our sons will grow up to be murderers and terrorists
It's the nigga in me, accompanied by the Cognac
You can ask around, don't fuck with the Mobb
I could've told you that, where you been at? You must've cut class
If it ain't me, another member of my crew will kick your ass
(What! What! What!)
We do damage to limbs
In '91, stompin' you out with black Timbs
Prodigy and the H.A.V.O.C. from the Q.B.C
Puttin' cowards where they supposed to be
If I don't know your face, then don't come close to me
I got too much beef for that
Drama in the 3rd degree
And to the kids — you don't wanna be me
I'm up in the mix of action, where niggas wanna kill me
But it's the start of they endin'
My man's lendin' me his Linden
Forty-two shots dependin'
On whether or not the clip is full to the top
We bustin' caps non-stop, blazin'
In all the shows, and even at the hoes
(Nah, nah, chill, son)
What?
And it's the start of your endin'
(word up yo, it's the start of niggas endin', youknowhatI'msayin?)
And it's the start of your motherfuckin' endin'
(All y'all weak-ass crews that got drama with mines

Yeah
Uh-huh, no doubt, son
Word up

What up, son? I heard they got you on the run for a body
Now it's time to stash the guns
They probably got the phones tapped, so I won't speak long
Gimme a hot second, and I'ma put you on
It's all messed up, somebody snitchin' on the crew
And word is on the street is they got pictures of you
Homicide came to the crib last night, six deep
Askin' on your whereabouts and where d'you sleep
They said they just wanna question you, but me and you know
That once they catch you, all they do is just arrest you
Then arraign you, hang you, I don't think so
It's a good thing you bounced for now, just stay low
Once in a blue, I check to see how you're doin'
I know you need loot, so I send it through Western Union
They'd probably knock down the door
In the middle of the night, sometimes around four
Hopin' to find who they lookin' for, but they won't succeed
All they gonna find is mad empty bags of weed
But word, son, you got the projects hotter than hell
Harder for brothers to get they thug on, but oh, well
Son, they know too much, even the hoodrat chicks
""Oh, you heard who did what?"" — No, I don't know who did shit!
So stop askin', and I know I'm not goin' crazy
From windows, I see lights flashin' and maybe
Somebody's takin' pictures, you know who that be
Police lovers, and neighborhood snitches
They put up a G, so everybody's pointin' fingers, and lyin'

What up, black? Hold your head wherever you at
On the flow from the cops with wings on your back
That snitch nigga gave police your location
We'll chop his body up in six degrees of separation
Killa, listen, shit ain't the same without you at home
Phony niggas walk around, tryna be your clone
They really fear you, when you was at home, they was pale
That's why they wanna see you either dead or in jail
By the time you hear this rhyme, you'll probably be locked up
Tried to hide, somewhere along the lines, your plans slipped up
Got caught up in a crime that you can't take back
Reminiscin' how I used to pick you up in the Ac'
Years ago, when we was younger
Seemed the hood took us under very deep
Wonderin' who snitchin' got me losin lots of sleep at night
You know my mouth is tight
I never sang to the cops 'cause that shit ain't right!
Sometimes, I stroll past the scene of the crime and backtrack
Damn! Why the situation go down like that?
It'll be a long time before the heat dies down
And a couple of years 'fore we see you around
But 'til then, maintain and keep your story the same
The cops is grabbin' wrong niggas, lookin' for someone to blame
They harassin', strugglin' to find the truth
There's a chance ya case'll get thrown out 'cause they ain't got no proof
To say you're guilty, your fingerprints filthy
Deliver me the gun, I'll tie it to a brick and throw it in the river
Make sure it sinks to the bottom
Outsmart police, snuck you out the projects, we got 'em!

As long as I send your maggot ass to the essence
I don't give a fuck about my presence
I'm lost in the blocks of hate, and can't wait
For the next crab nigga to step and meet fate
I'm lethal when I see you, there is no sequel

So why you wanna end your little life like this?
'Cause now you've bumped heads with kids that's lifeless
I live by the day only if I survive the last night

Hell yeah! About to get my thug on
The 41st side of things

I used to be in love with this bitch named E&J
Don't fuck with her no more, now I fuck with Tanqueray
Tanqueray introduced me to her first cousin Gold (Yeah, that bitch)
Last name was English, and the first name Olde
But Gold couldn't take the dick, it made me lazy
We split apart, and now I met this new trick Dainy
Now me and Dainy, we been together ever since
Our love combines to form a science, what is this?
I bust her cherry, took her virginity in '91 (Word)
Now that she's open, everybody want to tap somethin'
Go get your own, don't make me have to fuckin' clap somethin'
I love my shorty more than life, now ain't that somethin'?
To love you, Dainy, more than livin' itself
Even though my friends tell me she ain't good for my health
When I go pick her up, they tell me, ""Put her back on the shelf""
They say, ""Yo, P! She only wants you for one thing — that's your wealth""
But I don't pay attention, 'cause she's my baby, the Dainy
You know she drive me crazy, she's my number one lady
Met her back in '89, now she's 22, actin' like she 40 (Word)
She said ""All I need is a man to support me
Besides, you from the 41st side of things (Uhh)
And Queensbridge niggas be actin' like they kings
Pushin' Lexuses, wearin' fat diamond rings""

I fill my brain up with liquor, and drink away the pain (What, what)
I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my mind up with Dainy, and drink away the pain

Tommy Hil' was my nigga, and others couldn't figure
How me and Hilfiger used to move through with vigor
Had to sit and plan on how to make these seven figures
Said a Brinks is comin' through, at Fashion Avenue
At Tuesday at two, now we gotta form a crew
Of motherfuckers, who ain't goin' out like suckers
Told me call Karl Kani, and all my other brothers
I told my sister Walker, who was the smoothest talker
""Negotiate the deal with them other money stalkers""
Diesel drove the the Bimmer, the hatchback of course
Nautica'll navigate to keep us on course
Polo's actin' bolo, tryin' to say he the Boss
I said shut the fuck up! (Nahmean?) The kid is out with the loot sack (Word)
Got a big trey pound, itchin' just to swoop back
Timb is on the roof with the twelve gauge rifle
Scope is on the top, so you know he livin' Eiffel
Took the aim of Oswald, caught him North in the Face!
All them other kids, they had they tools aimed at space
Levi had the snub, so you know they gettin' laced
Donna Karan was cryin' 'cause mad shells was flyin'
Damn, all we want is a piece of the pie and
Nike scooped the sacks 'cause he moves like Air
Threw them shits up in the trunk, now we up out here
Got back to the mansion to divvy up the paper
Helly Hansen was the brain of the whole entire caper
So she felt it was right, for her to get the whole slice
Everybody in the crew didn't think it was nice
I guess not! And Guess was hot, so guess what? (What?)
Guess took the jigga, and jigged her in the gut!
When you play with crime, sometimes it's not too fly
Even though the goods look deceivin' to the eye
The end situation could leave your ass fried (Yo, a-yo)
That's why you got to walk on by, walk on by
Walk on by, walk on by, walk on by
(Yo, bring that Dainy home)

My man P put me on to the shorty Henn Rock
Now, Henn Rock is strong enough to make your heartbeat stop
One sip, I thought the bitch was a fuckin' warlock
The more she started givin' me, the stronger I got
Pushed her off to the crew, then she started gettin' jealous
Steamed 'cause I spent more C.R.E.A.M. with the fellas
""Fuck them niggas! Spend that cheese on me
See if they be around when you need pussy""
Then I thought to myself, ""Yo, this trick is right!""
Gathered up all my dough, so I spent the night
I can't help it, she got my brain in a headlock
Niggas started riffin', ""Why you trickin'? Yo, this shit must stop!""
Moms like ""You need to see the AA
Better hope they help your ass out on the same day""
But never that, I got the shakes so I need that
Son call me stressed out, I just be that
But when it comes to Henn Rock, dunn, I need that
She's my shorty for life, so fuck the feedback
I think the whole world's goin' insane
I fill my brain with the Henny, and drink away the pain
I think the whole world's lost its brain
I sip away on the liquor, and drink away the pain

To all the brothers who ain't here
Pour a little somethin' on the floor
Time to get a little bent, do our thing
Word up! The 41st side of Queens gettin' bent, know what I mean?
It's an everyday thing
Henny got my mind in a headlock, Dainy got me goin' crazy
Dainy take me away, Dainy take me away28Embed",https://images.genius.com/9c2fa45d611606aba6beada5971d7b32.665x665x1.jpg

Check it out now
Word up, son, shit is ill, kid
Nahmsayin'?
Bein' that we livin' the motherfuckin' trife life
Still have another day, right?
It's only right
Let me put you on to what happened, son
You ain't gonna believe this shit
Kick that shit

It's just another day, drowning my troubles wit' a forty
That's when I got a call from this brown skin shorty
She asked me where's my crew at, said we could do whatever
She got a crew too and said that we should get together
I said, ""Aight, just call me back in a hour
So I can take a shower and gather up the manpower""
Then I hung up the horn
And I thought to myself that it might be on
'Cause this trick ain't pick up the phone to call me in years (Why?)
Ever since I left the ho lonely in tears
Ain't no telling what her friends putting up in her ears
Ideas of setting me up I'm not trying to hear
(Check it out, son) So we take the gats for precautions
Plus, this trick live in Brooklyn, home of the coffin
She might got a whole battalion of Bucktowners
Waiting for us to get up off the train and surround us
Or maybe, I'm blowing this shit out of proportion
But this shit do happen to niggas very often
So fuck it, a nigga gotta do what he meant to
My crew got my back, 'Fuck the world' is my mental
We put together five soldiers
The bitch called, my blood curdled
Told me to meet her on Myrtle
Got to the plaza, we're waiting for the G train
We put a plan together, just in case the beef came
Now we Bed-Stuy bound
Far from home and on unknown ground
But together we six deep, with five heats, nothing sweet
First nigga fronting getting lifted off his fucking feet
It took eternity to reached our destination
My heartbeat is racing like a cardiac patient
We finally got to Myrtle, outside the train station
I saw not a soul, told my peoples to be patient
But hold up, that's when a black caravan rolled up
My legs didn't froze up, I grabbed my pound
Told my man, ""Eyes open 'cause it might go down""
Said he don't like the way the shit is starting to sound
Every angle of the car was smoked out and tinted
So we couldn't tell if the enemy was in it
It might have been TNT, I wasn't trying to wait and see
We jetted through Marcy 'cause D's ain't bagging me
Word, son, they got us on the run, dunn, see, yo

OK, check it, you're on your way to your girl's crib
But the bitch live in the 'Bridge
You ain't really sweating it
'Cause little do you know, the niggas in the 'Bridge be setting it
You thought you was safe
And tried to walk the back streets without heat
On the 41st Side of 12th Street
The side where niggas don't give a fuck
The side where if you come through fronting
Kid, you getting bucked
On your way, to apartment 3A
With a phat herringbone, let him slide? No days
Son, get the heat, 'cause I'm about to stick him
(Fuck that shit, yo, if that nigga front, yo, hit him!)
Aight, bet, so just hold it down
While I cock back the long three pound
You're upstairs boning, not knowing that I'm scheming
Just the right time, kid, it's twelve in the evening
You're leaving out the building as you kiss your girl goodbye
Thought you was safe and got caught by surprise
""What's going on?"" as I reply
""Shut the fuck up and don't make this to another homicide""
He tried to play tough so I put one in his brain
Even though I took his life, all I wanted was his chain
Come through truck without heat, how you figure?
When you in the projects, keep your fingers on the trigger
But fuck that, we juxing
If you got what we like, it gets tooken
Put you on your back, send you on your way, yo, good looking
Now we catching a cab to Halsey & Lewis in Brooklyn
Getting tore up from the floor up, hit the dress store up
Got the 80 auto in case a nigga wanna roll up
Get your motherfucking shit swoll up
Now it's back to Queens to serve fiends
Making G's by any means, my eyes on my enemies
Sipping Hennessy, with my mind on some crime shit
One-time searching me, but never ever find shit
It's the everyday, get the loot then breeze
Though my goal is to leave outta state, push ki's
But all this bullshit holding me down, I can't leave
Fuck a 9-to-5, I get the loot with ease
Don't even need a degree to earn a six-digit figure
I get mines slinging on the corner with my niggas
Pulling the trigger when the drama appears
'Cause a nigga worse enemy is fear

Straight thugs on this side, it's do or die to the death
Like the terminal ill takin' they last breath
Read your last rites, God, forgive me
For the sin I'm about to commit, takin' a life
Kill or be killed, rather that than somebody else
Readin' my will, you feel what I feel, you know the deal
Keep the infrared next to my bed, one in the head
Hearin' noises, dead tired, eyes bloodshot red
Sleep with half closed eyelids
Some say it's strange, sometimes that's how strange life get
Go easy on the bottle, niggas love to see when
Niggas slippin' off point, on the strength they bet
Scopin' your ice, appraisin' it like the Diamond District
Jeweler with they hand on the biscuit
Do ya, wanna get caught lifted
Or sober, so you can react quick?
Blow you off the atlas as if I caught you fuckin' my wife
On my thousand dollar mattress

I got the style of a stillborn child, I'm ill
If it's beef, poke him with the fork, make sure he's done well (Very-very)
The streets raised me crazy, now I'm immune to it
So when they start shootin', we don't stop the music
Keep it movin' that's how we do it (C'mon, c'mon, Dunn)
Been through more drama than the Baldwins, you still crawlin' (Still crawlin')
Apply street rules to the office, high performance
Rap author, made millions off of
Melodic, hypnotic productions
That'll fuck with your conscience and touch your emotions (You feel me? You feel me?)
You feel me? I'll write a graphic page
Escort niggas to they grave, relate to the projects
We the black Mobb, it gets deeper than rap music (Don't get no realer than this)
It's more real than any words I can muster
Pull the black Cadillac trucks up (What?)
Hop out them shits like what? Y'all niggas can't touch us

Silk shirts and my chest show what a flirt
Halle Berry blew a kiss at the Barbara Streisand concert
Silk pants colored pink, gators match gangster musical thing
And I front like my doo-doo don't stink
Instinct like Cuba Gooding steppin' out the latest toy
Hazard lights blinkin', gators hit the floor
Everybody watch the red carpet entrance, cameras flashin'
Just to think, that was yesterday's action
'Cause today goes either way, we came a long way
From hallway steps and hand-me-down shit
Fuck my foes, I seen the other side, Nextel cell roam
Call the chopper phone, heliport in my home
Quincy Jones posters, wake up, guns
Under my pillow, I can't talk around chauffeurs
Shit is better than a novel, autobiographic
Spit it on tracks, it becomes classic
Start some, make my heart pump, spark one, I'm God son
Nastradamus, last one to blast when the NARC's come
Know how to leave anything in thirty seconds
When you feel the heat, comin' and flee with the murder weapon
I'll release one, shot you deceased, learn your lesson
Your flesh turn to maggots, bastards, you past it
Cremate your flesh to ashes, you don't need
A suit, no wake, no funeral, and no casket
Y'all need to give it up

It all began on the street, to the back of a blue police vehicle
Next come the bookings, the way things is lookin'
It's Friday, you in for a long stay
Gettin' shackled on the bus first thing come Monday
Hopin' in your mind you'll be released one day
But knowin', home is a place you're not goin' for a long while
Now you're up on the Isle
And the position that you in got you refusin' to smile
But keep in mind, there's a brighter day, after your time spent
Used to be wild, but locked up, you can't get bent
Thought you could hack it, now you're requestin' PC
You fragile, it ain't hard to see
Niggas like that don't associate with me
I'd rather, get busy to the third degree
'Cause the war in population's on infinitely
If this was the street, my razor would be a MAC demon
Hit you up, leave your whole face screamin'
What you in for, kid? Bustin' nuts?
Cats heard of me in street stories caught inside this trap
Who are you to look at me with your eyes like that?
Wisen up, young blood, before you make things escalate
And I would hate to set your crooked ass straight

Make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

You tried to dip, duck, but still got bucked
You talk too much shit, you shoulda kept your mouth shut
All that gossip, motherfucker, don't you know my Glock kicks
Hollow tips, to your body, mad toxic?
I fade you, blow you with a rusty-ass razor
Did you a favor, tried to wet you but I graze you
Pop goes the Glock when there's beef on the block
Chill for a while, make them think the beef stop
Then I creep like a thief in the night, it's only right
Ain't no turnin' back, it's on tonight
And if I get caught, then my ass is up north
Straight on a course for Upstate New York
Stressed, smokin' back to back cigarettes
In pop', dawg, on-point in the mess hall
But to avoid that, from head-to-toe dipped in all-black
Hit them niggas where they pump they cracks at
Havoc, with the murder master plan
Keep my 9 up to par so my shit won't jam
God forbid if my shit do
Run behind a tree, fix my shit then hit you
Slugs in your body, mainly in your brain tissue
Ditch from the scene, get ghost, stash the pistol
So simple, then watch my back, lay up and relax
Roll a sack K-A, black, find a shorty to tap
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

I got the powder, combine wit' the powder, and water
It oughta, drop in a half and hour
In the, form of oil, watch the cocaine boil
Keep my eye on it so the shit won't spoil
Then I pause.. and ask God why
Did he put me on this Earth just so I could die
I sit back and build on all the things I did wrong
Why I'm still breathin', and all my friends gone
I try not to dwell on the subject for a while
'Cause I might get stuck in this corrupt lifestyle
But my, heart pumps foul blood through my arteries
And I can't turn it back, it's a part of me
Too late for cryin', I'm a grown man strugglin'
To reach the next level of life without fumblin' down or foldin'
I got no shoulder to lean on but my own
All alone in this danger zone
Time waits for no man, the streets grow worse
Fuck the whole world, kid, my money comes first
'Cause I'm out for the gusto, and trust nobody
If you're not family, then you die by me
'Cause niggas will have you locked up
The snitch be your man
Givin' police the run down on your plans
But never goin' down like that
So I, shut my mouth and hold my words back
Illegal business, forever mines, fuck payin' taxes
The last kid that shitted and gave police access
To my blueprints, used names as evidence
Skipped town and I haven't seen the snitch nigga ever since
The moral of the story is easy to figure out
A lesson that you can't live without
Livin' the high life, make your moves at night
Pack your heat in this war zone, niggas is trife
Runnin' from one-time, ain't no time to slip
Make one false move and it's a up north trip

Forever wild from the cradle to the grave
Kid, watch your back! One-time's comin' always (Yeah!)
They locked me up for 12 days, I can't comprehend
Now I'm a free man on the streets again
Chasin' St. Ides down with some Seagram's Gin
Life is like a dice game, and I'm in to win

On the scene, from the 41st side of Queens (Yeah!)
We get the C.R.E.A.M., laid up, love-love redeem
'Cause I mean what I mean, I'm out to claim king
Doin' my thing, throughout states my name'll ring

To all my peoples locked down, comin' back to life
In the world once again, though ya bid was trife
While you was gone, we was goin' to war
And even more, saw my man layin' dead on the floor
Kid, I swore that our crew'd live forever, I guess I was wrong
No, until we meet again, hold ya head and stay strong (Yeah)
Yo, got my mind on a place to hide from police (Where?)
Sweatin' dogs as I'm runnin' 'cross 12th Street
Just as I approached the block
I spotted Jake on the creep down by Vic's weed spot (Say word?)
Made a U-ey up the hill, plus a change of plans
I had to.. hurry back so I could warn my mans

It had me stressed a little somethin', had my heart rapidly pumpin'
Niggas started cuttin', behind the bushes duckin'
My ears rung, I plunged a clip into the guns
Got grazed in the arm, one slug hit my son
He was bleedin' from the head, I couldn't believe it
We was defeated, if it was a case, I couldn't beat it
Felt like cryin' (The temperature's risin'!)
I saw my man helpless, damn near on the verge of dyin'
So to P I passed the iron

Kid, you ain't lyin'
I went to stash the murder weapon, plus I'm relyin'
On a door to be open, goin' in the building, it's a trap!
Police buckin' at me, they tried to twist my dome back
Jetted up the staircase to the third floor
Reach behind the sink, throw the heater on the floor
Lock the door, police grab me up and try to break my jaw
Said, ""Where's the gun we saw?"" (I don't know)
""We know you was there at the homicide scene""
(I don't know nothin')
""And if it wasn't you, it was somebody from ya team""

Nobody move, stand still

Son blessed me with the iron, I got beef with
Some niggas from the other side over some weak shit
Load up the heaters, greet 'em with the hollow tips
Flip 'em like the Gotti clique, my crew strictly body shit!
The cradle to the grave is where I'll end up
Fuck gettin' sent up North, son, I'm bent up!
Doin' my dirt on the low
Fuckin' with the Mobb is like a trial, no doubt you gonna blow
You never know, he didn't even have to go
There, unprepared, now he's six below
Y'know I'm chillin', I gots no time for catchin' feelings
Get that money I want, some brothers wanna act funny
But it's all good! I still die for the hood
(For my peoples!) Yeah, knock on wood!

Triple L, rollin' dice while I put you on
To the drama, what I gotta say is short, not long
This nigga that I'm beginnin' to dislike, he got me fed
If he doesn't discontinue his bullshit, he might be dead!
You know him well, and probably go way back
But I don't care if he's your man doin' shit like that
I hope the word gets back to him, 'cause I'll screw him
He shitted on my man, and we got plans to do him
Lets get it over with quick, I'm tired of waitin'
Ain’t no fear over here, dear, we just debatin'
On when and how, later or right now
Spoke to Killa yesterday, he said to chill for a while
But it's hard actin' like everythin' is alright
I get the chills when I see that nigga in my eyesight
A dead man walkin', not only that, he's still talkin'
(About what?) About how and what he did very often
You don't know how much I fiend to put his ass in a coffin

It's only crack sales makin' niggas act like that
Back in the days we would scrap, now you lay on your back
As things changed with time, I traded in my knuckles for a Mac-10
And rather live the life of crime

Grab my MAC and slap a nigga senseless
Don't try to play me, if you do, you better D.O.A. me
Son, I got 'em shook, grab a little baby for shields
You got drama, run for shelter for real
Pour some beer for the ill, ain't no time to chill
Hit 'em up, 'cause I'm quick to erupt like dicks
Wet 'em up with the MAC, scratch 'em off my list
Show 'em the real meanin' of drama, you never had it
'Til you bumped heads with the Havoc
Ain't nuttin' soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat
Ain't nothing soft or sweet, I lift you off your feet
When I cock back the heat, whole crews retreat
We gets hectic
Shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic
Shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic

Everything is real inside my mind
These days, you can't make it if you ain't affiliated with crime
A lifetime of street livin'
Throughout the beef I've accumulated
Many slugs have been given
But wildin' ain't the way to be livin'
You're only gonna end up bloody on the floor shiverin'
Or locked up, caught inside the beast
Meanwhile, on the streets, ain't no more peace
My man, Stobo, kid, hold your own
In a cell locked down, not far from home
And at the same time on the outside, I'm representin'
Still packin' heat, make you cowards keep steppin'
Gettin' high, it's 'cause of the lye, I can't lie
I could move the crowd poppin' slugs in the sky
Why come around if you afraid of what's over here?
My man Havoc put the bug in my ear
On the real, for real, but wait, it gets realer
Real like an innocent child that turned killer
It's things like that that only makes things iller
Makin' cream, doin' sticks if you ain't a drug dealer
(It's) only facts coming out of my mouth piece
As far as I can see, these streets is gettin' sour
Q-U, too much drama to get into
And niggas regret when they begin to
Regardless of your name or what you been through
Pause for a second, open your eyes and think, duke
Life ain't the game that it seems to be
Fuck a fantasy, I'm livin' in reality
Caught up in this untouchable mentality
Hit you up bad, make you loose a few calories
I need to slow down, movin' through life at a high speed
Watchin' all the slow runners pass by me
I can see through you, due to, my Queens education
Speakin' on behalf of this drug-game nation
The Foundation

Up in Queens, shit is for real, we abouts to get hectic

Fresh out the motherfuckin' pack
Yo, yo

To all my niggas uncivilized to civilized
We cook the shake, move the weight across the tri-state
Them jux niggas bring the shook up out the crook type
Special deliver, sendin' shots through your Ac' Vigor
My Infamous Mobb get on they job
The truth gets revealed like we W Fard
Some shiesty New York niggas thirsty for cheddar
You shinin'? You get your jewels taken with your Hill sweater
Keepin' these rap fans like crack fiends
Until we re-up and put more Infamous up on the rap scene
Mix the coke rhymes with beats just like baking soda
Albums is G-packs selling across foreign waters
My Mobb picks is like dime bricks
Satisfaction, guaranteed real shit
Rapper Noyd, we meet you at the top, kid
And once we all on top, ain't no stoppin' it
I'm headstrong, at peace with myself like Islam
Stupid, a hundred niggas form around me
Like forcefield, pull out and use the gun like shield
The crew is worldwide, to think we started from the hill
Beware of quiet niggas laying in the cut (For what?)
Patiently watching, waiting for a come-up
Get your spot took, we rob land like white man
Plans to overthrow your whole shit while shakin' your hand (Motherfucker)

Word life, combination to the safe, it's on
Get that loot, motherfucker, spread love when you on
The 41st got the heat for them niggas that thirst
Yes, divine nine shine, put that ass in line
Regulate, I'm only here just to take what's mine
My clique combine, dangerous minds done bust the outline
A half a man generatin' grands
Kid, you know how I go, only fuck with fam
That's why you're lookin' from the outside in
Wonderin' how we bubblin', hustlin', breakin' days in
Grimy motherfuckers, gettin' info from your baby's mother
Got her pillow talking while that ass is sleepwalking
So all that bullshit you did, I know where you live
You better be on point when you walk in the rest
Your broke ass probably don't got a vest
So I suggest change your location is best
'Cause I'm coming through army fatigue dressed
Blessed with hollow tips, yes
To burn through your dirty-ass Guess
(Yes, still shinin', still climbin')
Ayo, your timing was way the fuck off, what is you tryin'?
This faggot-ass cat should get clapped for even tryin'
He tried to confront me, but only faced iron
Put holes through your shirt like Jamaican clothes
Fuck the myths, but science and numbers is how I live
If we ain't gettin' mathematics, somethin' got to give
Broke all your fucking life with no will to live
There's no way to live, resort to Plan B
Start to sticking, strongarm robbery and icepicking
It's sneak vicking, it's cold outside
I think it's past time for me to grab the clapper and take mines
You follow what I'm saying? It's like leading the blind
Trying to voice a clear picture of this life of crime
You slow learners'll understand in due time
Up the ladder of success with TECs, we trying to eat
And put that fly shit on my back
And bless my feet with some new and improved, spectate or make a move
Hesitate or regulate, it's on you

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hold the fuck up!
We gon' take this little intermission to listen
To what the fuck I got to say, you know?
I been doing this shit for years:
Holdin' heat, sellin'
Usin', abusin' all kinds of drugs;
Robbin' niggas, runnin' up in niggas' cribs
You know, the whole shit
So don't ever in your life get me confused
With some of them other niggas that you might see
On TV, or hear on the radio and such
Know what I'm sayin'?
I mean, this is me: P
I'm speakin' for my fuckin' self
When you see me.. at the show, or on stage or on the street
I DEFINITELY got the gat on me
You know what I'm sayin'?
Nahmean?
And it ain't like I'm tryin' to be a tough guy
Or tryin' to make people think I'm crazy by sayin' all this shit
But what it is, dat.. I know how niggas gets down, alright?
I used to be in the clubs: The Muse, The Tunnel, whatever the fuck
Niggas get they little drink on
Havin' fun with they little crew, you know what I'm sayin'?
Start cuttin', shootin', whatever
Things like that
A lot of these so-called ""rap niggas""
Ain't never seen no parts of that shit
You know what I'm sayin'?
You dig where I'm comin' from?
Word up, yo
And I know a lot of y'all niggas— matter of fact, all y'all niggas
Is right now listenin' to this shit like...
""Yeah, yeah, we gon' see them Mobb Deep niggas
We gon' see what they about, know what I'm sayin'?
Touch them niggas, we gon' see what level they head is at""
But, yo!
I'll let y'all niggas know right now, you know what I'm sayin'?
You ain't gotta waste your time, or your money on your hospital bills
And if you step to me on a personal level
I don't back down easy! You know what I'm sayin'?
There's a good chance your ass either gon' get
Shot, stabbed or knuckled down
One out of the three
So don't gamble with your life, duke, word up!
And believe me:
I know very well I could get shot, stabbed or fucked up too, whatever
I ain't ""Super Nigga"", I'm a little skinny motherfucker
It's all about who gets who first, though
You know what I'm sayin?
So therefore, say no more
To all my niggas — get the money!
Frontin' niggas — get deceased!
And, oh, yeah!
To all the rap-ass niggas with your half-assed rhymes
Talkin' about how much you get high, how much weed you smoke
And that crazy space shit that don't even make no sense
Don't ever speak to me when you see me, know what I'm sayin'? Word
I'ma have to get on some ol' high-school shit
Start punchin' niggas in they face just for livin'!

Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Black—it's time, word (Word, it's time, man)
It's time, man (Aight, man, begin)
Yeah—straight out the fuckin' dungeons of rap
Where fake niggas don't make it back
I don't know how to start this shit, yo—now;
Rappers; I monkey flip 'em with the funky rhythm, I be kickin'
Musician, inflictin' composition of pain
I'm like Scarface sniffin' cocaine
Holdin' an M16, see, with the pen I'm extreme
Now, bullet holes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up with street clothes, hand me a 9 and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo, with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin' bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin' Grants with the cee-lo champs
Laughin' at base-heads, tryna sell some broken amps
G-packs get off quick, forever niggas talk shit
Reminiscin' about the last time the task force flipped
Niggas be runnin' through the block shootin'
Time to start the revolution, catch a body, head for Houston
Once they caught us off-guard, the MAC-10 was in the grass, and
I ran like a cheetah, with thoughts of an assassin
Picked the MAC up, told brothers ""Back up!"" — the MAC spit
Lead was hittin' niggas, one ran, I made him back-flip
Heard a few chicks scream, my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze, heard it click, ""Yo, my shit is stuck!""
Tried to cock it, it wouldn't shoot, now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So, now I'm jettin' to the buildin' lobby
And it was full of children, prob'ly couldn't see as high as I be
(So, what you sayin'?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggas pullin' the triggers, bringin' fame to their name
And claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stick-up kids, they run up on us
.45’s and gauges, MAC's in fact
Same niggas will catch you back-to-back, snatchin' your cracks
In black, there was a snitch on the block gettin' niggas knocked
So hold your stash 'til the coke price drop
I know this crackhead who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good, she'll bring you customers and measuring pots
But yo, you gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggas erasin' and their wives basin'
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York State of Mind
You might also like

Be havin' dreams that I'm a gangsta, drinkin' Moëts, holdin' TEC's
Makin' sure the cash came correct, then I stepped
Investments in stocks, sewin' up the blocks to sell rocks
Winnin' gunfights with mega-cops
But just a nigga walkin' with his finger on the trigger
Make enough figures until my pockets get bigger
I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin'
Give me a Smith & Wesson, I'll have niggas undressin'
Thinkin' of cash flow, Buddha and shelter
Whenever frustrated, I'ma hijack Delta
In the PJ's, my blend tape plays, bullets are strays
Young bitches is grazed, each block is like a maze
Full of black rats trapped, plus the Island is packed
From what I hear in all the stories when my peoples come back
Black, I'm livin' where the nights is jet-black
The fiends fight to get crack, I just max, I dream I can sit back
And lamp like Capone, with drug scripts sewn
Or the legal luxury life, rings flooded with stones, homes
I got so many rhymes, I don't think I'm too sane
Life is parallel to Hell, but I must maintain
And be prosperous, though we live dangerous
Cops could just arrest me, blamin' us; we're held like hostages
It's only right that I was born to use mics
And the stuff that I write is even tougher than dykes
I'm takin' rappers to a new plateau, through rap slow
My rhymin' is a vitamin held without a capsule
The smooth criminal on beat breaks
Never put me in your box if your shit eats tapes
The city never sleeps, full of villains and creeps
That's where I learned to do my hustle, had to scuffle with freaks
I'm a addict for sneakers, 20's of Buddha and bitches with beepers
In the streets I can greet ya, about blunts I teach ya
Inhale deep like the words of my breath
I never sleep, 'cause sleep is the cousin of death
I lay puzzled as I backtrack to earlier times
Nothing's equivalent to the New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind
New York state of mind

How could Nas be garbage? Semi-autos at your cartilage (Uh)
Burner at the side of your dome, come out of my throne

Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (Uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back, but in my face
Y'all some well-wishin' (Bitch niggas), friendly-actin', envy-hidin' snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin', heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cock-a-Fella Records wanted beef (What?)
Started cockin' up my weapon, slowly loadin' up this ammo
To explode it on a camel (Haha) and his soldiers I can handle
This for dolo and his manuscript just sound stupid
When KRS already made a album called Blueprint (Dick)
First Biggie's your man, then you got the nerve to say

What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother, you traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad watchin' his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin' women
Were you abused as a child? Scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well, life is harsh, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatant or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin' chased through your building
Callin' my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was give you a style for you to run with
Smilin' in my face, glad to break bread with the God
Wearin' Jaz' chains, no TECs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars, Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin' with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I'll still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class?
You Tae-Bo ho, tryna work it out, you tryna get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna kick knowledge?
Nah, I'm tryna kick the shit you need to learn, though

The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go

Clothes, bankrolls, and hoes
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, then what, man, what?!
Visualizin' the realism of life in actuality
Fuck who's the baddest, a person's status depends on salary
And my mentality is money-orientated
I'm destined to live the dream for all my peeps who never made it
'Cause yeah, we were beginners in the hood as Five Percenters
But somethin' must've got in us, 'cause all of us turned to sinners
Now some restin' in peace and some are sittin' in San Quentin
Others, such as myself, are tryin' to carry on tradition
Keepin' this Schweppervescent street ghetto essence inside us
'Cause it provides us with the proper insight to guide us
Even though we know, somehow we all gotta go
But as long as we leavin' thievin'
We'll be leavin' with some kind of dough
So, until that day we expire and turn to vapors
Me and my capers will be somewhere stackin' plenty papers
Keepin' it real, packin' steel, gettin' high

I woke up early on my born day; I'm 20, it's a blessin'
The essence of adolescence leaves my body, now I'm fresh and
My physical frame is celebrated 'cause I made it
One quarter through life, some godly-like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual, plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I pus from
My skull, 'cause it's pain in my brain vein, money maintain
Don't go against the grain, simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin' foreigners, take they wallets, they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects, flashin' my quick cash
And got my first piece of ass, smokin' blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance
Niggas I used to run with is rich or doin' years in the hundreds
I switched my motto; instead of sayin', ""Fuck tomorrow!""
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is illmatic, keep static like wool fabric
Pack a 4-matic to crack your whole cabbage

Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin'
Time like Pappy Mason, with pens I'm embracin'
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timbs on my feets makes my cipher complete
Whether cruisin' in a Sikh's cab or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin' asleep
I keep fallin', but never fallin' six feet deep

Beef with housing police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money-gettin' style, rollin' foul
The versatile, honey-stickin', wild, golden child
Dwellin' in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days for broke days when sellin' smoke pays
While all the old folks pray to Jesús, soakin' they sins in trays
Of holy water, odds against Nas is slaughter
Thinkin' a word best describin' my life to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star will be my resurrection
Born in correction, all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead in right direction
How you livin'? Large or broke on charge cards and mediocre?

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down single-handed
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside, 1,000 miles from home
I need a new nigga for this black cloud to follow
‘Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Tryin' to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin' my peeps not eatin' can make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana, stabbin' women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin' Big Willie style
Check the chip-toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash loot in fly clothes, burnin' dollars to light my stoge
Walk the blocks with a bop, checkin' dames, plus the games people play
Bust the problems of the world today

Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know 'til I was drunk though
You freak niggas played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jump out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'Zé make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes
32 shotguns, regulate with my dunns
17 rocks gleam from one ring
They let me let y'all niggas know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin', Vegas-style, roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin' on millenniums
20 G bets I'm winnin' 'em, threats I'm sendin' 'em
Lex with TV sets the minimum, ill sex adrenaline
Party with villains, a case of Demi-Sec
To chase the Henny, wet any clique with the semi TEC
Who want it? Diamonds I flaunt it
Chickenheads flock I lace 'em, fried broiled with basil taste 'em
Crack the legs way out of formation
It's horizontal how I have 'em fuckin' me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon?
Grab your gun, it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggas buck in broad daylight
With the broke MAC that won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs bug ‘cause they ain't promised shit

I was in the Jeep sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin'
Across the street you was wildin'
Talkin' about how you ran the Island in '89
Layin' up, playin' the yard with crazy shine
I cocked the baby 9, that nigga grave be mine
Clanked him—what was he thinkin'?
On my corner when it's pay-me time
Dug 'em, you owe me, cousin
Somethin' told me ""Plug him!""
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one
Heard shots and dropped, son, caught a hot one
Somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin' me my name
What the fuck? I got stitched up, it went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had the drop so how the fuck I get clapped?
Black was in the Jeep watchin'
All he seen speed by was a brown Datsun
And yo, nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin' at his crew daily
The Bridge touched me up severely, hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin' Ls, sippin' Coors on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin' war niggas I was cool with before
We used to score together uptown coppin' the raw

It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shining, sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet—invasion!
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian: half-man, half-amazin'
‘Cause in my physical I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drink Moët with Medusa, give her shotguns in Hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale; it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop
Place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like Braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill, like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills, I'm Ill plus Matic
I freak beats, slam it, like Iron Sheik
Jam like a TEC with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave 'em froze, like heroin in your nose

I dominate break loops, givin' mics men-e-strual cycles

And groove even smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin' like a Rasta in the weed spot

What up, kid? I know shit is rough doin' your bid
When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
Fuck it, black, no time for lookin' back, it's done
Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
It's bugged—plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry 9's
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
If so, then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
(One what?) One love!

One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is goin' on
The crackheads stalkin', loudmouths is talkin'
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear
Like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block
Your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, ‘cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I'll play it lowkey
So stay civilized, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind dies
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for reala
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin'
""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I need the time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with the corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the Bridge we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He said: ""Nas, niggas caught me bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bulletproof and pack a black tre-deuce.""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like The Mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches
Where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
‘Cause when the pistol blows
The one that's murdered be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families fucked up
Coulda caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed, never bust up
At the crowd, catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold-blooded as he spoke so foul
Only 12, tryin' to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wipin' the blunt's ash from my clothes
Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, Shorty Wop, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love
One love, one love, one love, one love

Life
I wonder.. will it take me under?
I don't know
Imagine smoking weed in the street without cops harassing
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle, cruising blue Bahama waters
No welfare supporters, more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot, my son got knocked
Evidently, it's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping outta state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage, we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashing fashion, designer clothes
Lacing ya clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be: Paradise life, relaxing
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange, the Range
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in a iller path
The Villa house is for the crew — how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better living, type of place to raise kids in
Opening eyes to the lies, history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, clique rolling
Tricking six-digits on kicks and still holding
Trips to Paris, I'd civilize every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoners set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I'd let Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities, and reverse fiends to Willies
It sound foul, but every girl I meet'd go down-town
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa!
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun, hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun, we won't land

You love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Ducked down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down outta state
Wait! I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still, nobody want a nigga having shit!
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I'd push a Q45 Infinit'
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies, or B Felony
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?!
If I ruled the world (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons — I love 'em, love 'em, baby!
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world

If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (Imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em, love 'em, baby!

Straight up, shit is real
And any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on a humble, guns'll blast, niggas tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
Who don't care, guzzling beers
We all stare at the out-of-towners
(Aiyyo, yo, who that?) They better break North
Before we get the four pounders and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasing brothers
The D's on the roof tryin' to watch us and knock us
And killer coppers even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
The fronters, wannabe ill niggas and spot runners
Thinking it can't happen 'til I trap 'em and clap 'em
And leave 'em done, won't even run about gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards

Cold be walking with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committing sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
‘Cause life ain't shit but stress, fake niggas, and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennessy while pulling on mad blunts
The brutalizer, buddha-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissing in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Cazals with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and TECs
Fly new chicks and new kicks, Heines and Beck's

Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxanne
I used to wake up every morning, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us running from cops
If it wasn't hanging out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breaking the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
Fuck a yard, God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun, son, but fuck being the wanted man
But if I hit rock bottom, then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too, with Swoop
Barkim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it; Mayo, you count the profit

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein' born
Same time a man is murdered — the beginnin' and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural I explain
My plateau and also what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my sign's for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline, am I sane?
That depends, carry MAC-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape CD covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin' for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin' large, takin' it light
Pushin' big toys, gettin' nice, enjoyin' your life
It's what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and Hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course, N-A-S are the letters that spell... (Nas, Nas, Nas)

Dimes givin' fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my 9 spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth? Can't take it with you under this earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise — thug or die
Makin' choices that determine my future under the sky
To rob, steal or kill, I'm wonderin' why

I'm like bein' locked down around new faces, and none of 'em fam
I'm the feelin' of a millionaire spendin' a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it and I write down, and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it in ya system every night, now
Nas is like... life or death; I'm a rebel
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas is like... half-man, half-amazin'

(Right… Right…)
Check me out y'all
Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X catchin' the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I pull a number like a pager
‘Cause I'mma ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is givin' me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike-head, I wear chains that excite the Feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'm a performer, strange, show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad-phat fluid when you rhyme
It's halftime

(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) A-yo, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel
You might also like
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't a army that could strike back
So I react, never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
‘Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I max like cassettes, I flex like sex
In your stereo sets, Nas'll catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of The Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise ‘cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in '83, I was an MC sparkin'
But I was too scared to grab the mics in the parks and
Kick my little raps ‘cause I thought niggas wouldn't understand
And now in every jam, I'm the fuckin' man
I rap in front of more niggas than in the slave ships
I used to watch ""CHiPs"", now I load Glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual of rap
I'm a professional, and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand?
‘Cause in the streets, I'm well-known like the number man
Am I in place with the bass and format?
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle, I see trial niggas say I'm wild
I hate a rhyme-biter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas soon, the real rap comes at halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) Exhale, check it, it's halftime
(Right…) It's halftime
(Right…) It's real in the field
Word life, check it

I got it goin' on, even flip a morning song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARC's hit
Word to Marcus Garvey, I hardly sparked it
‘Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin' 'em fast, doin' this, that and the third
But chill, pass to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay and hit a matinée
Puttin' hits on 5-0
‘Cause when it's my time to go, I wait for God with the .44
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to Hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for damp weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the Island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin' fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo I'm out
(Right…) It's still halftime
(Right…) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right…) '92, it's halftime

We gonna do a lil somethin' like this
Y'know what I'm sayin'?

Keep it on and on and on and on and
Know'm sayin'? Big Nas
Grand Wizard, God, what is it?
(It's like…) Haha, you know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, go ahead and rip that shit, dun!

I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessy-holders and old-school niggas, then I be dissin' a
Unofficial that smoke Woolie Thai
I dropped out of Cooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, fuck who's the live-r
My man put the battery in my back, a difference from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, money-wise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Choco blunts'll make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up a trife life, the times of white lines, the high pipes
Murderous night times and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, cold strapped
With my peeps that's into drug money market interact
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas, no sheisty vice to just snipe ya
Start off the dice-rollin' match, from craps to cee-lo
With side-bets, so roll a deuce, nothin' below
(Peace, God!) Peace, God! Now the shit is explained
I'm takin' niggas on a trip straight through memory lane

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alizé, niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine, God
Check the prognosis — is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama
For real, a nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis; my razor embraces many faces
Your telephone blown, black, stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petro, dramatic, automatic .44 I let blow
And back down po-po when I'm vexed, so
My pen taps the paper, then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustlin' brothers who keep the same rank
Pumpin' for somethin' — some'll prosper, some fail
Judges hangin' niggas, uncorrect bails for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hangin' cross with nails
I reinforce the frail with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say ""Peace!""
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat; that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin
Yo, fuck, rap is real! Watch the herbs stand still
Never talkin' to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my vein
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

This is what.. this what they want, huh?
This is what it's all about, word
Time to take affirmative action, son
They just don't understand, you know what I mean?
Niggas comin' sideways, thinkin' stuff is sweet, man
You know what I mean?
Niggas don't understand the four devils:
Lust, envy, hate, jealousy
Wicked niggas, man

Yo, sit back, relax, catch your contact, sip your Cognac
And let's all wash this money through this laundromat
Sneak attack, the new cats in rap worth top dollar
In fact, touch mines and I'll react like a Rottweiler!
Who could relate? We play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch 'em and break, undress 'em, tie 'em with tape
No escape, the Corleone, fettuccine Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get thrown

Yo! The smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
In Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo, my people from Medina, they will see ya when you re-up
Bring your heater, all your C.R.E.A.M. go between us
Real shit! My Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill wit' niggas that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam made a dread scream and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin' niggas to fiends
Yukons and ninja black Lexus
'Mega — the pretty boy with Mafia connections
It's The Firm, nigga, set it!

Yo, my mind is seein' through your design like Blind Fury
I shine jewelry, sippin' on crushed grapes, we lust papes
And push cakes inside the casket at Just' wake
It's sickenin', he just finished biddin' upstate
And now the projects is talkin' that ""Somebody gotta die"" shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke know how to expand coke in Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
Life's a bitch, but God forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so Hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars, meetin' Foxy at Demars, movin' cars
Your top papi Señor Escobar
In the black Camaro, Firm deep
All my niggas hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabees be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel
I got visions of multi millions in the biggest bundle
In a Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
E-Moneybags got Moët Chandon, bundle of 62
They ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team, we shittin' hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega and Escobar
I keep a phat marquess piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters, Carolina Herrera
Be The Firm, baby!
From BK to the 'Bridge, my nigga Wiz
Operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is?
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin' Cristy
Sittin' on top of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggas in Marcy
The gods — they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal
And Baba Shallah spoke, nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed with leak, that's pure though
Flippin' the bigger picture
The bigger nigga with the cheddar was mad dripper
He had a fuckin' villa in Manilla
We gotta flee to Panama
But wait — it's half-and-half, ki's is one and two-fifth, so how we flip?
32 grams raw, chop it in half, get 16, double it, times 3
We got 48, which mean a whole lot of C.R.E.A.M
Divide the profit by 4, subtract it by 8, we back to 16
Now add the other 2 that 'Mega bringin' through
So let's see, if we flip this other ki, then that's more for me
Mad coke and mad leak
Plus a 500, cut in half is 250
Now triple that — times 3, we got three quarters of another ki

One time
Yeah, yeah

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood
Mixed with 151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin' names on my hollow tips, plottin' shit
Mad violence, who I'm gon' body? This hood politics
Acknowledge it, leave bodies chopped up in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us, roll up and try knockin' us
One knee, I ducked, could it be my time is up?
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus stop glass burst, a fiend drops his Heineken
Ricochetin' between the spots that I'm hidin' in
Blackin' out as I shoot back, fuck gettin' hit
This is my hood, I'ma rep to the death of it
'Til everybody come home, little niggas is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb
We need more warriors soon, sent from the stars, sun and the moon
In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers

One prayer, tell God forgive me for one sin
Matter fact, maybe more than one
Look back at all the hatred against me, fuck all of them
Jesus died at age thirty-three, there's thirty-three shots
From twin Glocks, there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means one of my guns was holdin' seventeen
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime, hope your funeral
Never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin' is fair, niggas roll up shootin' from wheelchairs
My heart is racin', tastin' revenge in the air
I let this shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of MACs, two mini nines
If y'all niggas really with me, get busy, load up the semis
Do more than just hold it, explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin' in our way, they bust, we bust, they rush, we rush
Lead flyin', feel it? I feel it in my gut
That we take these bitches to war, lie 'em down
'Cause we stronger now, my nigga, the time is now
All I need is one mic (That's all I need, niggas, that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (There's nothin' else in the world)
All I need is one mic (That's all a nigga need to do his thing, you know?)
All I need is one mic (This is all I need)

All I need is one life, one try, one breath, I'm one man
What I stand for speaks for itself, they don't understand
Don't wanna see me on top, too egotistical
Talkin' all that slick shit the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggas'll move on you
Only if they know what your weakness is, I have none
Too late to grab guns, I'm blastin' 'cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done? Fooled you niggas
What you call an infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin'
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin'
Complete with thick scars
Brothers knifin' each other up in prison yards
Drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a cop'll get killed, body found in a dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggas throwin' dirt on my name
Jealous 'cause fiends got they work and complained
Bitches left me 'cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true, she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin', I never make the same mistakes
Movin' with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin' my melon 'cause none of these niggas real
Heard they were tellin' police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track, I'm finally found
You need some soul-searchin', the time is now

You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress
But nothing comes easy, it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lena Horne, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person, got her strung on that heroin
Cocaine, sniffing up drugs, all in her nose
Could've died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun 'cause now when she reaches for hugs, people hold they breath
'Cause she smells of corrosion and death
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
'Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing

This is for grown-looking girls who's only 10
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinking life's all about smoking weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)

Be, be-fore we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers, who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more, learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young princess, when you get your wedding ring
Your man will sing, ""She's my Queeeeeen""
I know I can (I know I can)
Be what I wanna be (Be what I wanna be)
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

Who locked up, first I regretted it, then caught my rage
Like, how could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised
Like a princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switchin' women, Pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster, can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail – dead that
Wait 'til he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your Mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit

This social network said: ""Nas, go and get your kid!""
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon' post no pic
Of herself underdressed – no inappropriate shit, right?
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser, then she Instagram'd it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Should've drove more time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they're too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's your little princess
Next day she's talkin' boy business – what is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this

And I ain't tryin' to mess your thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons

When she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed-off

Who not after material wealth but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood or even work for the president
As long as there’s no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep-rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you’re heaven-sent
Your smile put me at ease
You’re the woman I need, but where is she?

I hate when people write me hostile texts
On account of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life? Out of the question
What are they expectin'?
I be tryin' to reply and they never suppose I get my quiet time in?
They think forever I’m rollin' in dough, swimmin' in a pool of cash
God, wouldn’t they know or am I a fool to ask?
I’m well known, got people comin' at me mad
I had to tell homes, I don’t keep a cell phone, my bad
I drag off the L and try to silence it
The noise in my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond
I'd gallivant around the Equator, if that would get me off the radar

Escobar Season has returned
It's been a long time, been a long time comin'
It's life or death for me now
But you know, there's no turnin' back now
This is what makes me, this is what I am
Feel me? Let's go

You can hate me now (Q.B.)
But I won't stop now (Real niggas)
'Cause I can't stop now (Bravehearts)
You can hate me now (C'mon)
But I won't stop now (Uh)
'Cause I can't stop now
You can hate me now
You can hate me now

Well, you hate me, I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherfucker, die motherfucker, die!
You don't give a fuck, I don't give a fuck
Go down any way you want it to go down
You might also like
Do it now
Weak, jealous motherfuckers!
Do it now, do it now

Don't hate me, hate the money I see (Yeah), clothes that I buy (Uh-huh)
Ice that I wear, flows that I try (C'mon)
Close your eyes (That's right), picture me rollin', Sixes, money foldin'
Bitches, honeys that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer Prize winner
Best storyteller, thug narrator, my style's greater (You the best, that's right)
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters (Haha)
Commentators ringside try watchin' my paper (Watch this)
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin' more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens (Hah, picture that)
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
Like your favorite MC still makin' some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque back to the projects
But you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

Money is power, motherfucker!
I got millions of thugs on salary
Do it now!
You can hate me now (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (C'mon) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (C'mon)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now

Do it now! I told you, do it now!
Let's go

You wanna hate me, then hate me; what can I do
But keep gettin' money? Funny, I was just like you
I had to hustle hard, never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin': ""That's a clever nigga, nothin' to play with.""
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same OG
People warned me: ""When you on top there's envy""
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin' we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the street, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that – what you expect, hoe?
Nickname Esco, took this game to its threshold
Best flow, I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, 'cause niggas feel this, right?
You think I'ma come this far
And let you niggas stop me now?
I hate you too! (Do it now!)

You can hate me now (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (Now) (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Do it now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (C'mon) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (Uh) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Uh, uh)
You can hate me now (Do it now) (You can hate me now)
You can hate me now (Do it now)

I like this, I like the way this feels (Let's go)

It's a thin line between paper and hate
Friends and snakes, nine milli's and thirty-eights
Hell or the Pearly Gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows (Yeah)
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one (Right)
Took a little time to claim my spot
Jammin' up the border to this game stop, and I side with the Lord (Uh)
Ride for the cause while drivin' niggas shot at my doors (That's right)
Plottin' I'm sure, to catch me with they Glocks to my jaws
Tried stickin' me up, but I flipped on these ducks (You tried?)
Instead of me, ambulances were pickin' 'em up (That's what you hate)
Niggas fear what they don't understand
Hate what they can't conquer, guess it's just inferior man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin'
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin', c'mon!

(Yeah) (It won't stop)
You ain't never seen a nigga like me (It won't stop) ever in your life (You can hate me) (Never!)
And that's what you can't understand!

You can hate me now (C'mon) (I won't stop)
But I won't stop now (I can't stop)
'Cause I can't stop now (Do it now, do it now) (You can hate me)
You can hate me now (Do it now, do it now, niggas) (I hate you too)
But I won't stop now (C'mon) (You can hate me now)
'Cause I can't stop now (Hate me now)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now) (Hate me now)
You can hate me now (You can hate me now) (C'mon, niggas!)

You can hate me now (C'mon, niggas!) (You can hate me now)

Respectfully

Bucket on low like Erick and Parrish
Closed casket flow, all you niggas get deaded
They don't give you one single rose while you can smell it
So I pick from my own garden (Garden)
Wanna go out in my garden like Godfather
Grandkids and a Rottweiler got over the block trauma (Yeah, trauma)
So what you sayin', nigga? You gots to chill (Uh-huh)
Thinkin' you the truth, really you not for real (EPMD!)
Back to back with it, the hardest shit of the year (Nasir Jones, remix)

EPMD, we back in business
Ain't nobody fuckin' with us, come to your senses (Uh)
P is the second comin' of God, somеthin' to witness
Piece of shit, fly on your hеad like Mike Pence's, we in the trenches
I'm mad, better yet, I'm on a rampage
My people can't even get minimum wage
Fuck a stimulus (Uh), give me some interest (Uh)
Give me a loan (Oh), give me a home
Give me that land you owe me so I can roam
So when you trespass, blaow, one in your dome
Best wishes, ghost 'em like he Tommy
Ain't worried 'bout nothing 'cause Hit Squad behind me

EPMD, we back in business
I visualize what it is, not what it isn't
We at the mafia table next to the kitchen
Eatin' Michelin Stars, countin' a million

Dun! I let it go for the family, meetin's at Cote in Miami
Them wine bottles on maggie, extra large
Sign up for my masterclass, Escobar
Feet up at Mets Stadium at my restaurant
Tied in from AZ to Dave East
You know my thoughts get crazy
My teachers, they couldn't grade me
I know some Haitians in Dade County, got choppers in Haiti
She booked a flight to Colombia, made her body amazin'
Just to post it on Tumblr, this that ""fuck up the summer"" shit
I don't care what you comin' with, me and Hit-Boy runnin' shit (Runnin' shit)
Big gold, rope chains, but they flooded now (Yeah, flooded now)
Pull up with the Ghost like a haunted house (Haunted house)
She gettin' scary, blood on my hands like Carrie
Might walk through a cemetery to see where hip-hop is buried
I said it was dead, but it faked its death like Machiavelli
You see letters in red splatter, look like sauce and spaghetti
(Yeah, ready?)
EPMD, we're back in business (What?)
Livin' in cramped conditions, will give you ammunition
I stock those shelves, I got those shells like Taco Bell and I'm not gon' fail
I got no L's (Noels) like Christmas, you don't wanna make the claws (Claus) come out (Nah)
Y'all should call yourselves Santa (Why?) 'cause none of y'all are real (Nah)
Not a 'single one' (Like what?), like a dollar bill (Yeah)
Just like your bitch in appellate court, she's on a pill (Appeal)
We got her a 'bond' and she'll
Never 'bail' on me (Bail on me), not even outta jail (Haha, jail)
EPMD, but me, I gots no chill (Ch-chill)
Just a lotta skrill
Lady, my paper's so crazy, I just tossed a mil' out the window of my mobile
On the fuckin' freeway on the way here (Yeah)
Like Rudolph and his homies when they pullin' the sleigh, yeah
That's a lot of bucks flyin' when I'm makin' it rain, dear
Green on me but no weed, shorty, just these, darling
A pocket full of pills, some are Tylenol 3s, prolly two or three Molly
So some are E  (Summary), which reminds me of ""Rap Summary,"" mami
My theme song, me and ""P"" always used to play that shit on repeat all day
So please call me ""Big Daddy"" (Daddy)
Plus I got the Kane (Cane) and ""Lean On Me"" (Yeah)
MCs, I'm eatin' you B-I-T-C-H's like tortilla chips
Me, I'm free of debt, yeah, green is on Chia Pet (Woo)
This is the effects of my old neighborhood misery index
Poverty at its peak, OCD and PTSD, I guess
R.I.P. out to DMX, Stezo E and Nipsey
Ecstasy and Prince Markie Dee, MF DOOM, I hit 50 via text
Told him that I love him 'cause I don't even know when I'ma see him next (Nah)
Tomorrow could be your death (Bring that beat back)
Yeah, and this shit ain't for the faint
'Cause the brain's illa trained killer, danger, deranged
And I drank all the DayQuil (Yeah) I blank on the paper
Then wait 'til the page fill up (What?)
Hate spiller, shameful the strength of a pain pill or tranq'
I just pray for the day when I'm able to say that I'm placed with the greats
And my name's with the Kane's and the Wayne's, and the Jay's and the Dre's
And the Ye's, and the Drake's and the J Dilla's, Jada's, Cool J's
And the Ra's and amazin' as Nas is, and praise to the Gods of this
Shout to the golden age of Hip-Hop and the name of this song is

He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people
The people who cannot afford to go to big concert
Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality

Hope I don't catch a homo, grossing our net
Simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me, search but can't find me
Fuck sadness, had this been you having this lavish
Habitual happiness, at me you wouldn’t look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, that’s my word on my body
I’ll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty

My baby's drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She needs to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills—I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war
My lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story
We was divided
She had fish fries, cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through

You say it's puppy love; we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather

Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever, ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry

Done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more
'Cause my dick all in her mouth
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating
In the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on?
You keep on singin' the same song, let bygones be bygones
And you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

Well, she's got a hottie's body but her attitude is potty
When I met her at a party, she was hardly acting naughty
I said, ""Shorty, would you call me?""
She said, ""Pardon me, are you balling?""
I said ""Darling, you sound like a prostitute pausing""
Oh, so you're one them freaks
Get geeked at the sight of an ATM receipt
But game been peeped, droppin' names, she's weak
Trickin' off this bitch is lost, must take me for a geek
A quick way to eat, a neat place to sleep
A rent-a-car for a week, a trick for a treat
No go on the raw sex, my AIDS test is flawless
Regardless, we don't wanna get involved with all them lawyers
And judges just to hold grudges in a courtroom
I wanna see your support bra, not support you
(Not support you, not support you)
I know you'd like to think your shit don't stank, but
Lean a little bit closer, see

Yuh
Uh-huh
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
(Y'all know)
It's him and I: Aquemini

Yeah

Now is the time to get on—like Spike Lee said, ""Get on the Bus""
Go get your work and keep your beeper chirping—it's a must
Is you on that dust or corn starch? Familiar with that smack, man?
The music is like that green stuff provided to you by sack-man
Pacman, how in the fuck you think we gon' do that, man?
Riding round Old National on eighteens without no gat, man
I'm strapped, man, and ready to bust on any nigga like that, man
Me and my nigga, we roll together like Batman and Robin
We prayed together through hard times, swung hard when it was fitting
But now, we tapping the brakes from all them corners that we be bending
In Volkswagens and Bonnevilles, Chevrolets and Coupe de Villes
If you ain't got no rims, nigga, don't get no wood-grain steering wheel, for real (Real)
You can go on and chill out and still build
Let your paper stack 'stead of going into overkill
And pay your fuckin' beeper bill, bitch

Yeah
Yuh, yuh (Yeah)
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
Twice upon a time, there was a boy who died
Lived happily ever after, but that's another chapter
Live from ""home of the brave,"" with dirty dollars
Beauty parlors, baby ballers, bowling-ball Impalas
Street scholars, majoring in culinary arts—
You know, how to work bread, cheese, and dough from scratch
But, see, the catch is you can get caught
Know what you selling, what you bought, so cut that big talk
Let's walk to the bridge—meet me halfway
Now you may see some children dead off in the pathway
It's them poor babies walking slowly to the candy lady
It's looking bad—
Need some hope like the words ""maybe,"" ""if,"" or ""probably""
More than a hobby
When my turntables get wobbly, they don't fall
I'm sorry, y'all, I often drift—I'm talking gift
So when it comes, you never look the horse inside its grill
Of course, you know I feel like the bearer of bad news
Don't want to be it, but it's needed, so what have you?
Now, question: Is every nigga with dreads for the cause?
Is every nigga with golds for the fall?
Naww, so don't get caught up in appearance
It's OutKast, ""Aquemini"": another Black experience
Okay

Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
Nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
The name is Big Boi, Daddy Fat Sax, the nigga that like them Cadillacs
I stay down with these streets 'cause these streets is where my folks at
Better know that, some say we pro-Black, but we professional
We missed a lot of church, so the music is our confessional
Get off the testicles and the nutsacks, you bust 'round, we bust back
G—Get back for real niggas that's out here tryna spit facts
You 'ear that? You can't come near that, maybe you need to quit (Quit)
Because ""Aquemini"" is Aquarius and the Gemini running shit
Like this, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
My mind warps and bends, floats the wind, count to ten
Meet the twin, André Ben', welcome to the lion's den
Original skin, many men comprehend
I extend myself, so you go out and tell a friend
Sin all depends on what you believing in
Faith is what you make it—that's the hardest shit since MC Ren
Alien can blend right on in with your kin
Look again, 'cause I swear, I spot one every now and then
It's happening again, wish I could tell you when
""André, this is André, y'all are just gon' have to make amends""
Even the Sun goes down, heroes eventually die
Horoscopes often lie
And sometimes, ""Y""
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
And nothing lasts forever, but until they close the curtain
It's him and I: Aquemini
Master: Finally, Igor! We've done it, we've done it!

Well it's the M-I-crooked letter, ain't no one better
And when I'm on the microphone you best to wear your sweater
'Cause I'm cooler than a polar bear's toenails
""Oh hell, there he go again talking that shit""
Bend corners like I was a curve, I struck a nerve
And now you 'bout to see this Southern playa serve
I heard it's not where you're from but where you pay rent
Then I heard it's not what you make but how much you spent
You got me bent like elbows, amongst other things, but I'm not worried
'Cause when we step up in the party; like a mouse, you scurry
So go get your fucking shine box and your sack of nickels
It tickles to see you try to be like Mr. Pickles
Daddy Fat Sax, B-I-G B-O-I
It's that same motherfucka that took them knuckles to your eye
And I try, to warn you not to test but you don't listen
Giving the shout-out to my Uncle Darnell locked up in prison

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit

Or will it know to beat the odds regardless of the skin tone?
Or will it feel that if we tune it, it just might get picked on?
Or will it give a fuck about what others say and get gone?
They alienate-us cause we different keep your hands to the sky
Like Sounds of Blackness when I practice what I preach ain't no lie
I'll be the baker and the maker of the piece of my pie
Now breaker, breaker 10-4 can I get some reply?

Every day I sit while my nigga be in school
Thinking about the second album at the Dungeon shooting pool
Like E-S to the P-N, cause we adjust to the beat in the zone (zone)
Honey, I'm home but I'm not married
Carried a lot of problems around being frustrated
And now I'm sitting at the end of the month I just made it
Like you made the B team, and like your daddy's wife you making that coffee
You heard the ATLiens, so back the hell up off me
Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody gots to play their part
God works in mysterious ways, so when he starts
The job of speaking through us, we be so sincere with this here
No drugs or alcohol, so I can get the signal clear as day
Put my Glock away, I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition, so I'm ready for war, okay

Now throw your hands in the air
And wave 'em like you just don't care
And if you like fish and grits and all that pimp shit
Everybody let me hear you say, ""O-Yea-yer""

You can't stop the train
Who want some? Don't come unprepared
I'll be there, but when I leave there
Better be a household name
Weatherman tellin' us it ain't gon' rain
So now we sittin' in a drop-top, soakin' wet
In a silk suit, tryin' not to sweat
Hit somersaults without the net
But this'll be the year that we won't forget
The 1-9-9-9 Anno Domini, anything goes
Be what you wanna be as long as you know
Consequences are given for livin'
The fence is too high to jump in jail
Too low to dig, I might just touch hell—hot!
Get a life, now they on sale
Then I might cast you a spell
Look at what came in the mail
A scale and some Arm & Hammer
Soul-gold grill and a baby mama
Black Cadillac and a pack of Pampers
Stack of questions with no answers
Cure for cancer, cure for AIDS
Make a nigga wanna stay on tour for days
Get back home, things are wrong
Well not really, it was bad all along
Before you left adds up to a ball of power
Thoughts at a thousand miles per hour

Slant back Cadillac, 'bout five niggas deep
75 MC's freestylin' to the beat
'Cause we get crunk, stay drunk, at the club
Shoulda bought an ounce, but you copped a dub
Shoulda held back, but you throwed a punch
'Posed to meet your girl but you packed a lunch
No D to the U to the G for you
Got a son on the way by the name of Bamboo
Got a little baby girl, four-year—Jordan
Never turned my back on my kids, for them
Should've hit it, quit it, rag-top
Before you re-up, get a laptop
Make a business for yourself, boy, set some goals
Make a fat diamond out of dusty coal
Record number four, but we on a roll
Hold up, slow up, stop, ""Control""
Like Janet, Planet, Stankonia's on ya
Moving like Floyd, comin' straight to Florida
Lock all your windows, then block the corridors
Pullin' off my belt 'cause a whipping's in order

One for the money, yes, sir, two for the show
A couple of years ago on Headland and Delowe
Was the start of something good
Where me and my nigga rode the MARTA through the hood
Just tryna find that hookup
Now, every day, we looked up at the ceiling (Yuh)
Watching ceiling fans go 'round, tryna catch that feeling off instrumentals
Had my pencil, and plus, my paper
We caught the 86 Lithonia, headed to Decatur
Writing rhymes, tryna find our spot off in that light
Light off in that spot, knowing that we could rock
Doing the hole-in-the-wall clubs, this shit here must stop
Like, ""Freeze!"" We making the crowd move, but we not making no G's, and that's a no-no

Check it, a-one-two, a-one
""Two dope niggas in the Cadillac,"" they call us
Went from ""Player's Ball"" to ballers
Putting the South up on the map was like Little Rock to banging
Niggas say, ""Motherfuck that playin',"" they payin', we stayin', layin' vocals
Locales done made it with them big boys up in this industry
""OutKast, yeah, them niggas, they making big noise""
Over a million sold to this day; niggas, they take it lightly

Full as a tick, I was stoned like them white boys
Smoking them White Golds before them blunts got crunk
Chunky asses, passes getting throwed like Hail Marys
And they looking like Halle Berrys
So, so fine, intertwined, but we ain't sipping wine
We's just chilling, I'm the rabid villain, and I'm so high
Smoking freely, me, Lil B, Reek, Mone and Shug
And my little brother, James, things changed in the hood
Where I live at, them rats know, ""Momma, I want to sing
But, momma, I want to trick (Trick), and momma, I'm sucking dicks, now""
We moving on up in the world like elevators

Talking 'bout smoke something
""Hey, man, you remember me from school?"" ""No, not really""
But he kept smiling like a clown, facial expression looking silly
And he kept asking me, ""What kinda car you drive?
I know you paid, I know y'all got beaucoup hoes
From all them songs that y'all done made""
And I replied that I'd been going through the same things that he has
True, I've got more fans than the average man
But not enough loot to last me to the end of the week
I live by the beat like you live check-to-check
If it don't move your feet, then, I don't eat, so we like neck-to-neck

Leanin', checking out the scene
Gangsta boys, Bigga's lit
Ridin' out, talkin' shit
Nigga, where you wanna go?
You know the club don't close 'til four
Let's party 'til we can't no more
Watch out, here come the folk—""Damn""
Oh, Lord


As the plot thickens, it gives me the dickens, reminiscent of Charles
A lil' discotheque nestled in the ghettos of Niggaville, USA
Via Atlanta, Georgia
A lil' spot where young men and young women go to experience they first little taste of the night life
Me? Well, I've never been there
Well, perhaps, once, but I was so engulfed in the Ol' E', I never made it to the door
You speak of hardcore
While the DJ sweatin' out all the problems and troubles of the day
While this fine, bow-legged girl, fine as all outdoors, lulls lukewarm lullabies in your left ear
Competing with ""Set It Off"" in the right
But it all blends perfectly, if you let the liquor tell it
""Hey, hey—look, baby, they playin' our song!""
And the crowd goes wild, as if Holyfield has just won the fight
But in actuality, it's only about 3 a.m., and three niggas just done got hauled off in the ambulance, sliced up
Two niggas done started busting—""Wham! Wham!""
And one nigga done took his shirt off, talking 'bout, ""Now, who else wanna fuck with Hollywood Court?""

Smooth, like a hot comb on nappy-ass hair
I walked up on her and was almost paralyzed
Her neck was smelling sweeter than a plate of yams with extra syrup
Eyes beaming like four karats apiece, just blindin' a nigga
Felt like I chiefed a whole O of that Presidential
My heart was beating so damn fast
Never knowing this moment would bring another life into this world
Funny how shit come together sometimes, you dig?
One moment, you frequent the booty clubs, and the next four years, you and somebody's daughter raisin' y'all own young'n
Now, that's a beautiful thang
That's if you're on top of your game and man enough to handle real-life situations, that is
Can't gamble feeding a baby on that dope money
Might not always be sufficient
But the United Parcel Service and the people at the post office didn't call you back because you had cloudy piss
So now, you back in the trap
Just that: trapped!
Go'n' and marinate on that for a minute
Da, da, da, Ja, Ja, Ja

Many a day has passed, the night has gone by
But still I find the time to put that bump off in your eye
Total chaos, for these playas, thought we was absent
We takin' another route to represent the Dungeon Family
Like Great Day, me and my nigga decide to take the back way
We stabbin' every city then we headed to that Bat cave
ATL, Georgia, what do we do for ya?
Bulldoggin' hoes like them Georgetown Hoyas
Boy, you sounding silly, think my Brougham ain't sittin' pretty
Doing doughnuts 'round you suckas like them circles around titties
Damn, we, the committee, gon' burn it down

I met a gypsy and she hipped me to some life game
To stimulate, then activate the left and right brain
Said, ""Baby boy, you only funky as your last cut
You focus on the past, your ass'll be a has-what
That's one to live by or either that's one to die to
I try to just throw it at you, determine your own adventure, André""
Got to her station, ""Here's my destination""
She got off the bus, the conversation lingered in my head for hours
Took a shower, kinda sour 'cause my favorite group ain't comin' wit' it
But I'm witcha 'cause you probably goin' through it anyway
But anyhow, when in doubt
Went on out and bought it 'cause I thought it would be jammin'
But examine all the flawsky-wawsky, awfully
Sad and it's costly, but that's all she
Wrote, and I hope I never have to float in that boat
Up shit's creek, ""It's weak"" is the last quote
That I wanna hear when I'm goin' down
When all's said and done and we got a new joe in town
When the record player get to skippin' and slowin' down
All y'all can say is, ""Them niggas earned the crown,"" but until then

Somebody hit me the other day for a rendezvous
Was it the bitch that fucked the Goodie and the Dungeon Crew?
Let's say her name was Suzy Skrew 'cause she screwed a lot
Makin' a nigga hit that chonk at legitimate spots
Not no parks, backseats, or things of that nature
Had to hate ya, playa
I'm dickin' the ho down — never said I paid her
Straight laid her, slayed the bitch like Darth Vader, made her
From College Park and Fayette all the way down to Decatur
Like Jada, her wig was sharp and sporty — that was shawty
Safe as a snake on eggs in a Bimmer 840
It's foggy, I went to the crib to call her but she lost me
My baby mama beeped me, seven o'clock, it's gonna cost me
But I still wanna cut her, though — maybe she had to work?
I caught her in the mall, wearin' a real tight skirt
She was fine as fuck — I wanted to sex the ho up
She said, ""Let's hit the parking lot so I can sick your duck""
I said, ""Cool, I really wanted to cut you but this'll do
I gotta pick up my daughter, plus my baby mama beeped me, too""
She said she understood and everythin' was kosher
I gave her a Lil' Wil CD and a fuckin' poster
It's like that, now

It's like that, now
You better go on and get the hump up out your back now
It's about fo' or five cats off in my 'Lac now
We just shoot game in the form of story raps now (Yeah)

Now Suzy Skrew had a partner named Sasha... Thumper
I remember her number like the summer
When her and Suzy, yeah, they threw a slumber
Party, but you can not call it that 'cause it was slummer
Well, it was more like spend the night
Three in the mornin', yawnin', dancin' under street lights
We chillin' like a villain, and a nigga feelin' right
In the middle of the ghetto on the curb, but in spite of all the bullshit
We on our back, starin' at the stars above (Aww, man)
Talkin' bout what we gonna be when we grow up (Mm)
I said, ""What you wanna be?"" She said, ""Alive""
It made me think for a minute, then looked in her eyes
I coulda died, time went on, I got grown
Rhyme got strong, mind got blown
I came back home to find lil' Sasha was gone
Her mama said she with a nigga that be treatin' her wrong (Man)
I kept on singin' my song and hopin' at a show
That I would one day see her standin' in the front row
But two weeks later, she got found in the back of a school
With a needle in her arm, baby two months due
Sasha Thumper

You better go on and get the hump up out your back now

Every time I uh try to get a peace of mind
Niggas try to get a piece of mine
So I gotta grab my piece
It's the return of the gangster, thanks ta'
Them niggas that's on that blow that run up in your crib
Which contains your lady and an 8 month old
Child to raise plus you true blue 'bout this music but
They do not want to hear it
Because they'd rather be bouncing and shooting
And killing and bouncing and shit, get down
Return of the gangsta, thanks ta'
Them niggas that think you soft and say y'all be gospel rappin'
But they be steady clappin' when you talk about
Bitches, and switches, and hoes, and clothes, and weed
Let's talk about time travelin', rhyme javelin
Somethin' mind unravelin', get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas that got them kids
That got enough to buy an ounce
But not enough to bounce them kids to the zoo
Or to the park so they grow up in the dark never
Seein' light 'til they end up being like yo' sorry ass
Robbin' niggas in broad-ass daylight get down
Return of the gangsta thanks ta'
Them niggas who get the wrong impression of expression
Then the question is Big Boi what's up with Andre?
Is he in a cult? Is he on drugs? Is he gay?

Want a description? My royal highness
So many plusses when I bust that there can’t be no minus
Went from yelling crickets and crows
Bitches and hoes to queen thangs
Over the years I been up on my toes and yes I seen thangs
Like Kilroy, chill boy because them folks might think you soft
Talking like that, man, fuck them niggas, I’m going off
And coming right back like boomerangs when you throw 'em
With these old ghetto poems, thinking it's better for 'em
When they can let they thumb down from hitchhiking
Inviting niggas into the temple they call their body
Now everybody got it, had it, talked about it amongst they friends
Coming around my crew looking Jazzy, wanna pretend
Like you Ms. Goody Four-Shoes, even Bo knew that you got poked
Like acupuncture patients
While our nation is a boat, straight sinking
I hate thinking that these the future mommas of our chill'un
They fucking a different nigga every time they get the feeling to
I’m willing to go the extra kilometer
Just to see my señorita get her pillow
On the side of my bed where no girl ever stay

Kitty cats be scratching on my furry coat to curl
Up with me and my bowl of kibbles and bits
I want to hurl, 'cause most of the girls

I kept, to say the least no, no it can't cease
So I begin to piece my two and two together
Gots no snowy weather, have to find somethin' to do better, bet
I said subtract, so shut up that, nonsense about some silent night
I gots it crunk, if it ain't real, ain't right

Jump back (Jump back)
Come on (Come on, come on)
Yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

From front to back street, listen, we on a mission
To get right, work the street corner in the midnight
Picture the scene, these fiends with five
Ten dollar dreams, scheme, for a sack of that, believe that
I'm wit' whateva like Wheatstraw
Stuck servin' my cocaine raw
Drop sixty-two off the brick, jump back
Twenty over, now that's mo' money to get
Slick, we finna lick on this corner without gettin' caught
But time, keep a slippin' and money gettin' short
Plus that crooked cop Brock think we blow slangin' (fuck him)
That why he ride through the hole with the do' swangin'
But I make moves, shake them tricks up out they shoestrings
We more precise when we do things
'Cause life like shakin' the dice, but I buck back twice
Like five-deuce, four-trey, okay

Shit, cops and robbers, niggas be bound to get them dollars and cents
They get in a slump like baseball players when they short on they rent
Anything goin', you ain't knowin' how much money you spent
But in the real world you surrounded by these ladies and gents
Who hang around you 'cause you be buyin' all the weed and all the chicken
Feedin' everybody, smokin' 'em out
When you was broke, though, they was missin'
Now you ridin' 'bout four deep, startin' to tear up your suspension
And your baby mama on child support, my fault, forgot to mention
You don't even have a checking account wasn't thinking about no pension
I used to work at Steak 'N' Ale, Old Gold off in the kitchen
Had determination and graduated, now I got the whole rap world fascinated
I wanted a piece of the pie for me and my family so I made it
Continue to sell dope, it's payin' the bills so you gon' do it
But legislation got this new policy: three strikes and you're ruined
Now where your crew at? Yeah
I'm strictly stressin' dirty dirty, gon' represent it to the T-top

Ayy, me and my buddy on the cut and they know we servin' 'em slabs
We better watch what we doing, and look out for Joe Nab
And quit re-ing up and standing on this same old block
Before our gangsta-ass partner get both of us shot
Niggas talkin' 'cause they making some flow
But still ain't did nothin' that ain't been done befo'
You can't be trying to showcase, just put it down for your spot
And improvise and work with that little you got
So I think when I finish selling my last sack
I'ma take some of this money, go and give some back
'Cause people won't forget about the time you gave, know'm'sayin'?
And start thinkin' 'bout a path to pave

""Baby, did you hear that?"" ""Yeah, baby, I heard it too""
Look out the window, golly, the sky is electric blue
Mama Earth is dying and crying because of you
Raining cats and jackals, all shackles disintegrate to residue
Silly mortals haven't a clue as to what the fuck is going on
I'm on the telephone dialing the Dungeon (""Hello?"")
This Dre, bring the MP and the SP
Meet me at the center of the Earth and travel carefully
Baby, grab the baby, cause baby, it ain't much time
Mama Earth is tossing and turning and that's a sign
Omega nigga I.F.O.s are landing in Decatur
Hope I'm not over your head, but if so you will catch on later
Played the track, guess she could not take it anymo'
Raping her heavenly body like a ho, coochie so'
From niggas constantly fucking her, never loving her
Never showing appreciation, busting nuts in her face when they done
""Who said good folks is not supposed to die?""

The sky is falling, nobody balling, they done gave back they guns
For some tickets to the playoffs, but the Hornets, they won
Nigga, we slum, kept all the guns, I gotta protect my family
I drove the biggest thing in the house cause I knew they'd try to ram me
But I'm stabbing, making a path on expressway the best way I know how
Look up in the sky, east, west, no clouds
Him coming now, fuck that money now
I ask my honey how she feeling and is Jordan okay? ""Yeah, yeah, she chillin'""
We should be at The Dungeon shortly, ain't nobody on they porch, see?
Approaching the final exit, I'm thinking I see four horsies
But I don't though, nigga, you won't know until it's on ya
I put that on my dope boys from A-Town to California
All the weed smell like ammonia but at the Dungeon I know they're smoking
Writing the raps and doing the beats to make this last recording
Fuck abortion, I got in the booth to run the final portion
The beat was very dirty and the vocals had distortion

I met you in a club in Atlanta, Georgia
Said me and my homeboy were coming out with an album
You looked at me like, ""Yeah, nigga, right""
But you gave me your number anyway, you were on the talcum
Powder—how's about them oranges?
Moved away from home to school with big plans
By day, studied the history of music
By night, just to pay for that shit, you'd dance
To get your pants was a Mission Impo–ssible
We were both the same age, but I
Suppose, wasn't on the same page, but in
The same book of life, so I'd page you when
I felt you that were getting off of work
Or either when you're on your way to school
We started hanging like Ernie and Bert
And in my idle head, I'm thinking, ""Cool""
Just when I think I'm going down your shirt
You're hiking up your skirt now
The events that followed had me volley
If your hometown would be Heaven or Hell
The angelic nastiness you possessed made you by far the best
Therefore, hard to tell
You'd drop me off by the Dungeon
Never came in, but I knew that you were wondering
""Now, are these niggas in this house up to something?
Selling crack, sack by sack, so they could function?""
W-W-Well, yes and no
Yes, we were selling it, but no, it wasn't blow
Cook it in the basement, then move it at a show
Then grab the microphone, and everybody yelled, ""Ho!""
Meanwhile, the video starts playing
BET, college radio, and a van
Packed full of niggas with a blunt in their hand
And one in they ear—you know what I'm saying, but
I kept your number in my old phone
Got a new chip-flip with the roam-roam
So it took me a minute to retrieve seven digits
But I promised I would call you when I got home, but
When I got home, I never did
By the time I did, heard that you'd had a kid
By some nigga in Decatur who replied, ""See you later""
When he got the good news—that's life, shit
Now, I'm nineteen with a Cadillac
My nigga had a Lex with the gold pack
Got a plaque, but I'm living with my Pop-Pop
So I got a Glock and a LoJack
Yeah, kinda fast for that fella in class who used to draw
And never said much, 'cause half of what he saw
Was so far from that place you wanna be
That words only fucked it up more; follow me
Are you starting to gather what I'm getting at?
Now if I'm losing you, tell me, then I'll double back
But keep in mind: At the time, ""Keep it real"" was the phrase
Silly when said now, but those were the days
When Spring Break and Daytona
And Freakniks made you wanna
Drop out of college and never go back
Move to the South, but that ain't a Kodak
Moment; on went myself and Big Bo—
Well, you knew hm as ""'Twan""
That's right—you were around before this shit begun
Well 'Twan had a daughter and
Sorta was made to mature before the first tour
We hit the road like Jack
Laughed and cried and drive it back with some 'gnac
Girls used to say, ""Y'all talk funny. Y'all from the islands?""
And I'd laugh, and they'd just keep smiling
""No, I'm from Atlanta, baby; he from Savannah—maybe
We should hook up and get tore up and then lay down; hey, we
Gotta go because the bus is pulling out in thirty minutes""
She's playing tennis, disturbing the tenants
Fifteen-love, fit like glove
Description is like fifteen doves
In a jacuzzi catching the Holy Ghost
Making one woozy in the head and comatose—agree?
Enough about me—how's about you? How's the lil' kid?
She was about two the last time we spoke
I hadn't smoked or took a shot of drink
'Cause I'd start the second album off on another note; now—
That note threw some niggas in the hood off
But see, I'd balled out, and 'fore I'd fall out
I'd slow my Lac down to a nice speed
The brain was that fried egg, I might need
New direction was apparent
I was a child looking at the floor, staring
So changing my style was like relief for the primitive beast
Yes, I was on the rise, yeast was the street
To make bread, never primary concern
Just to hop on these beats and wait my turn
I'd meet Muslims, gangstas, bitches, rastas
And macaroni niggas: ""impastas""
So, on a trip to New York on some beeswax
I get invited to a club where emcees at
And on stage is a singer with some thing on her head
Similar to the turban that I covered up my dreads with
Which I was rocking at the time
When I was going through them phases trying to find
Anything that seemed real in the world
Still searching, but I started liking this girl
Now, you know her as Erykah ""On & On"" Badu
Call Tyrone on the phone, ""Why you—
Do that girl like that, boy? You ought to be ashamed""
The song wasn't about me, and that ain't my name
Were young, in love; in short, we had fun
No regrets, no abortion, had a son
By the name of ""Seven""
And he's five; by the time I do this mix, he'll probably be six
You do the 'rithmetic, me do the language arts
Y'all stand against the wall blindfolded; we throw the darts
To poke you in the heart and take you from the start
To when ""luxury transportation"" meant a MARTA card
Or either when your girlfriend that went to Mays' mama
Or her daddy let her borrow the Benz, because she smart
Or maybe if your neighbor does you a huge favor
And he sells you that Rabbit that's been sitting in his yard
You fix it up, you trick it out
You give it rims, you give it bump
You give it all your time because that's all you can think about
And that's as far as I got
(*music fades*)

So that Rabbit that you thought about that whole summer—the next summer, you didn't want that Rabbit no more. You wanted something bigger and better.""

Came way too late but, baby, I'm on it
There's a fine line between love and hate, you see

That's liberation and, baby, I want it
Can't worry 'bout what another nigga think
Now that's liberation and, baby, I want it

Lemme hear it, lemme hear it, lemme though, lemme hear it
How many times I sit back and contemplate?
I'm fresh off the dank but I'm tellin' my story
My relationship with my folks is give-and-take
And I done took so much, now give me my glory
To have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left up-a to me and my momma n'em told me (Yes, she did)
I say, to have a choice to be who you wants to be
It's left up-a to me and my momma n'em told me

No, no, no (Ah)
I'm so tired, it's been so long struggling hopelessly
Seven and forty days (Hey)
Oh, I sacrifice every breath I breathe
To make you believe I'd give my life away
Oh, Lord, I'm so tired, I'm so tired (Tired)
My feet feel like I walked most of the road on my own (Own)
All on my own (Yeah)
We alive but we ain't livin', that's why I'm givin' until it's gone
'Cause I don't wanna be alone (I don't wanna be alone)
I don't wanna be alone (Yeah) (No, no, no)
If there's anything I can say to help you find your way
Touch your soul, make it whole, the same for you and I
There's not a minute that goes by that I don't believe we could fly
But I can feel it in the wind, beginning or the end

You make a million dollars, make a million mo'

Spending your life trying to numb the pain
You shake that load off and sing your song
Liberate the minds, then you go on home
I must admit, they planted a lot of things
In the brains and the veins of my strain
Makes it hard to refrain, from the host of cocaine
From them whores, from the flame
From a post in the game
Makes it hard to maintain focus
They're from the Glock rounds, and lockdowns, and burials
The seeds that sow, get devoured by the same locusts
Cause it's a hard row to ho
If your ass don't move, and the rain don't fall
And the ground just dry
But the roots are strong, so some survive
So you're surprised, now I'm bustin cries
You got more juice than Zeus
Slangin lightnin tryin to frighten
Plains dwellers, of the Serengeti
But get beheaded when you falsely dreaded
Melanin silicon and collagen injected
Dissectin my pride, fool I don't wanna get it started
We be the lionhearted, without infanticide
It's like that red sprite, you can't imagine it
Unless you lookin at the canvas of life
And not through the peephole of mortality
Single minded mentality
Gettin over on loopholes
Gettin paid two-fold on technicalities
Clickin your heels, scared to voice how you feel
Packing steel
Pickin cotton from the killing fields with no toe, though
I don't think we in Kansas no mo' though

Clean dressed or dirty mouth
Whether robbin preachers or killin Poor Righteous Teachers
You a scared demon
Shouldn't be allowed to spread semen
And you cowardly lions never defyin the jackals of Babel
Runnin with they pack, tail between your legs
Though the mane on your head say the story
As you downplay your glory
Cacklin, helpin the shacklin of your brethren happening
Just by rappin'

To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby
It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambú, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri

Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream (Heh)
Still tote gats, strapped with infrared beams (That's right) (What?)
Choppin' Os (Uh-huh), smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows (All a nigga knows)
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure (For what?), so grams I had to measure
However, livin' better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BMs, I'm the man, girlfriend

Yeah, honey, check it
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend (That's right), alright?
Is that aight wit' you?
Yeah, keep bangin'

I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
To the honeys gettin' money, playin' niggas like dummies (Uh)
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
You got a gun up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (Why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby, baby (Uh)

Hello?
Aw shit, nigga! The fuck time is it, man?
Oh, God damn
Nigga, do you know what time it is?
Aw shit, what the fuck's goin' on?
You aight?
Ah, nigga, what the fuck is wrong with you?

When I die, fuck it, I wanna go to hell
'Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell (What you talkin' 'bout, man?)
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie-goodies
Dressed in white, I like black Timbs and black hoodies (Aw, man)
God'll probably have me on some real strict shit
No sleepin' all day, no gettin' my dick licked
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies, loungin' in paradise
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice (You talkin' some crazy shit now, nigga)
All my life I been considered as the worst
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse (Ah)
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion
I know my mother wish she got a fuckin' abortion
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger (Yo, get a hold of yourself, nigga)
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger
I wonder; if I died, would tears come to her eyes?
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies (You're buggin', B)
My baby mother's eight months, her little sister's two
Who's to blame for both of them? (Nah, nigga, not you)
I swear to God I want to just slit my wrists and end this bullshit
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit (Nigga, what the fuck?)
And squeeze until the bed's completely red (It's too late for this shit, man)
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddha head
The stress is buildin' up, I can't— I can't believe (Ayo, I'm on my way over there, man)
Suicide's on my fuckin' mind, I wanna leave
I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me
But nah, you wouldn't understand
Nigga, talk to me please, man!
You see, it's kinda like the crack did to Pookie in New Jack
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back (Ayo, ayo, man, I'm out)
Should I die on the train track like Ramo in Beat Street? (I'ma call you when I get in the car)
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me (Ayo, where your girl at, man?)
My baby mama kiss me, but she glad I'm gone (Yo, put your girl on the phone, nigga!)
She know me and her sister had somethin' goin' on
I reach my peak, I can't speak (Ayo, you listenin' to me, motherfucker?)
Call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak (Ayo, c'mon, nigga)
I'm sick of niggas lyin' (Cut that), I'm sick of bitches hawkin' (Ayo)
Matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin' (Nigga, yo, yo, Big! Ayo, chill!)
*Gunshot*
Ayo, Big! Ayo, Big!

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9

It's the ten crack commandments, what?
Nigga can't tell me nothing about this coke
Can't tell me nothing about this crack, this weed, for my hustlin' niggas
Niggas on the corner I ain't forget you niggas, my triple beam niggas

I've been in this game for years, it made me a animal
There's rules to this shit, I wrote me a manual
A step-by-step booklet for you to get
Your game on track, not your wig pushed back
Rule Nombre Uno: never let no one know
How much dough you hold 'cause you know
The cheddar breed jealousy 'specially
If that man fucked up, get yo' ass stuck up
Number Two: never let 'em know your next move
Don't you know bad boys move in silence and violence?
Take it from your highness (Uh-huh)
I done squeezed mad clips at these cats for they bricks and chips
Number Three: never trust nobody
Your moms'll set that ass up, properly gassed up
Hoodied and masked up, shit, for that fast buck
She be laying in the bushes to light that ass up
Number Four: I know you heard this before
""Never get high on your own supply""
Number Five: never sell no crack where you rest at
I don't care if they want an ounce, tell 'em, ""Bounce!""
Number Six: that goddamn credit? Dead it
You think a crackhead paying you back? Shit, forget it
Seven: this rule is so underrated
Keep your family and business completely separated
Money and blood don't mix like two dicks and no bitch
Find yourself in serious shit
Number Eight: never keep no weight on you
Them cats that squeeze your guns can hold jums too
Number Nine shoulda been Number One to me:
If you ain't gettin' bagged, stay the fuck from police
If niggas think you snitchin', they ain't tryna listen
They be sittin' in your kitchen, waiting to start hittin'
Number Ten: a strong word called 'consignment'
Strictly for live men, not for freshmen
If you ain't got the clientele, say, ""Hell no!""
'Cause they gon' want they money rain, sleet, hail, snow
Follow these rules you'll have mad bread to break up
If not, twenty-four years on the wake up
Slug hit your temple, watch your frame shake up
Caretaker did your makeup, when you passed
Your girl fucked my man Jake up
Heard in three weeks, she sniffed a whole half a cake up
Heard she suck a good dick, and can hook a steak up
Gotta go, gotta go, more pies to bake up, word up (Uh)

Then the shit stop when I foil the plot
Neighbors call the cops, said they heard mad shots
Saw me in the drop, three and a quarter
Slaughter, electrical tape around your daughter
Old school, new school need to learn though
I burn, baby, burn, like ""Disco Inferno""
Burn slow like blunts with yayo
Peel more skins than Idaho Potato
Niggas know; the lyrical molesting is taking place
Fucking with B.I.G., it ain't safe
I make your skin chafe, rashes on them asses
Bumps and bruises, blunts and Land Cruisers
Big Poppa smash fools, bash fools
Niggas mad because I know that cash rules

Recognize my face so there won't be no mistake

Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, tryin' not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too, if you knew
What this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like niggas move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit yo game, talk yo shit
Grab yo gat, call yo clique
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
""Cash Rule Everything Around Me""
Shit, lyrically niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you?
We forgive you, for you know not what you do

7 A.M. woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No-Doz so pop a couple of those
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, make it gleam
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam
In between the scenes, destroy your dreams
You willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue of a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better get ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen in my hand
One of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open the last seal for real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label—kick it, nigga!
Nigga roll with Bone up into the dank spot
To the dome with a shot of burb
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag 'cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, y'all loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
For the pump now Leatherface, sin runnin' thuggin' and cuttin'
Little Mo Hart want to pull it ain't nothin'
Bitch if you steppin' we buckin' them guns that’s fucked up
Now let me get down for the grind
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get down for the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin' like, ""Give me back me money!""
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now who ready to get bent?

Now, who's hot, who not?
Tell me who rock, who sell out in the stores?
You tell me who flopped, who copped the blue drop?
Whose jewels got rocks?
Who's mostly Dolce down to the tube sock?
The same old pimp, Mase
You know ain't nothing change but my limp
Can't stop till I see my name on a blimp
Guarantee a million sales, call it love or luck
You don't believe in Harlem World, nigga, double up
We don't play around, it's a bet, lay it down
Niggas didn't know me '91, bet they know me now
I'm the young Harlem nigga with the Goldie sound
Can't no Ph.D. niggas hold me down
Cudda schooled me to the game, now I know my duty
Stay humble, stay low, blow like Hootie
True pimp niggas spend no dough on the booty
And then you yell, ""There go Mase!"", there go your cutie

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see

I'm the D to the A to the D-D-Y
Know you'd rather see me die than to see me fly
I call all the shots, rip all the spots
Rock all the rocks, cop all the drops
I know you thinking now, ""When all the ballin' stops?""
Nigga never home, gotta call me on the yacht
Ten years from now we'll still be on top
Yo, I thought I told you that we won't stop
Now what you gon' do with a crew
That got money much longer than yours
And a team much stronger than yours?
Violate me, this'll be your day, we don't play
Mess around, be D.O.A., be on your way
‘Cause it ain't enough time here
Ain't enough lime here for you to shine here
Deal with many women but treat dimes fair
And I'm bigger than the city lights down in Times Square
Yea, yea, yea

I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
I don't know what they want from me
It's like the more money we come across
The more problems we see
B-I-G P-O-P-P-A
No info for the DEA
Federal agents mad ‘cause I'm flagrant
Tap my cell and the phone in the basement
My team supreme, stay clean
Triple beam lyrical dream, I be that
Cat you see at all events bent
Gats in holsters, girls on shoulders
Playboy, I told ya, mere mics to me
Bruise too much, I lose too much
Step on stage, the girls boo too much
I guess it's ‘cause you run with lame dudes too much
Me lose my touch? Never that!
If I did, ain't no problem to get the gat
Where the true players at? Throw your Rolies in the sky
Wave 'em side to side and keep your hands high
While I give your girl the eye, player, please
Lyrically, niggas see B.I.G be flossin’
Jig on the cover of Fortune, 5-double-O
Here's my phone number, your man ain't got to know
I got the dough, got the flow down pizat
Platinum plus like thizat
Dangerous on trizacks, leave your ass flizat

Relax and take notes, while I take tokes of the marijuana smoke
Throw you in a choke — gunsmoke! Gunsmoke!
Biggie Smalls for mayor, the rap slayer, the hooker layer
Motherfucker, say your prayers!
""Hail Mary, full of grace..."" — smack the bitch in the face
Take her Gucci bag, and the North Face off her back, jab her if she act
Funny with the money? Oh, you got me mistaken, honey
I don't wanna rape ya, I just want the paper
The Visa, capisce-ah? I'm out like The Vapors
Who's the one you call Mr. Macho?
The head honcho, swift fists like Cu-macho
I got so much style, I should be down with the Stylistics
""Make up to break up"", niggas need to wake up
Smell the Indonesia, beat you to a seizure
Then fuck your moms, hit the skins to amnesia
She don't remember shit! Just the two hits
Her hittin' the floor, and me hittin' the clits!
Suckin' on the tits, had the hooker beggin' for the dick
And your moms ain't ugly, love, my dick got rock quick
I guess I was a combination of House of Pain and Bobby Brown
I was Humpin' Around and Jumpin' Around
Jacked her, then I asked her, ""Who's the man?""
She said, ""B-I-G"", then I bust in her E-Y-E

Move over, Lucifer, I'm more ruthless, uh!
Leave you toothless, you'll kibitz, I'll flip it
Tears don't affect me, I hit 'em with the TEC, G's
Disrespect me, my potency is deadly
I'm shootin' babies — no ifs, ands or maybes
Hit mummy in the tummy if the hooker plays a dummy
Slit the wrist of little sis
After she sucked the dick, I stabbed her brother with the ice pick
Because he wanted me to fuck him from the back
But Smalls don't get down like that
Found your father hidin' in a room, fucked him with the broom
Slit him down the back and threw salt in the wound
Who you think you're dealin' with?
Anybody step into my path is fuckin' feeling it!
Hardcore, I got it sucked like a pussy
Stab you 'til you're gushy, so please don't push me
I'm using rubbers so they won't trace the semen

There's several different levels to Devil worshipin'
Horses' heads, human sacrifices, cannibalism, candles and exorcism

I just beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh
And I never eat you unless the fuckin' meat looks fresh
I got a lion in my pocket — I'm lyin', I got a .9 in my pocket
And, baby, I'm just dyin' to cock him
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw
My Uzi's heavy as yours
Yeah, you met me before
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before
Marshall will step in the door, I'll lay your head on the floor

Yeah, motherfuckers better know
Huh, huh (I'm a bad, bad, bad)
Lock your windows, close your doors

Huh, yeah

My man Inf left a TEC and a nine at my crib
Turned him self in, he had to do a bid
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me?
Motherfuckin' right, my pockets lookin' kinda tight
And I'm stressed
Yo, Biggie let me get the vest
No need for that, just grab the fuckin' gat
The first pocket that's fat, the TEC is to his back
Word is bond, I'ma smoke him, yo, don't fake no moves (What?)
Treat it like boxin', stick and move, stick and move
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit
I've been robbin' motherfuckers since the slave ships
With the same clip and the same four-five
Two point blank, a motherfucker sure to die
That's my word, nigga even try to bogard
Have his mother singin', ""It's so hard""
Yes, love, love your fuckin' attitude
Because the nigga play pussy
That's the nigga that's gettin' screwed
And bruised up from the pistol whippin'
Welts on the neck from the necklace strippin'
Then I'm dippin' up the block and I'm robbin' bitches, too
Up the herringbones and bamboos
I wouldn't give a fuck if you're tnangerp
Give me the baby rings and the #1 Mom pendant
I'm slammin' niggas like Shaquille, shit is real
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal
'Cause mom duke ain't givin' me shit
So for the bread and butter, I leave niggas in the gutter
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous
Crazier than a bag of fuckin' angel dust
When I bust my gat, motherfuckers take dirt naps
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at?

Step into your wake with your blood on my shirt
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over bein' resistant
'Cause when I lick shots them shits is persistent
Goodness gracious, the papers
Where the cash at? Where the stash at?
Nigga, pass that
Before you get your grave dug from the main thug
Three fifty-seven slug
And my nigga Biggie got a itchy one grip
One in the chamber, thirty-two in the clip
Motherfuckers better strip, (Yeah, nigga, peel!)
Before you find out how blue steel feel
From the Beretta, puttin' all the holes in ya sweater
The money-getter, motherfuckers know the pedi'
Rolex watches and colorful Swatches
I'm diggin' in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it
Man, niggas come through, I'm takin' high school rings too
Bitches get delgnarts for their earrings and bangles
And when I rock her and drop her, I'm taking her door knockers
And if she's resistant: blakka, blakka, blakka
So go get your man, bitch, he can get robbed, too
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do?
Man I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it
And if I set it, the cocksucker won't forget it

But you trying to tell me it wasn't good?

That shit is real fucked up what you did
I hooked you up with my girl and shit

You don't even say shit to her, you know what I'm saying?
And all that bitch do is call me all day talking about you
""Why the fuck B.I.G. don't want me?""

Yo, B.I.G., this is Quita

You fucked with me last night
That's my best friend and we don't get down like that

I was waiting outside for your ass for like a fucking hour

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the Thrilla in Manila
Honeys call me ""Bigga the Condom Filler""
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the epilogue by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with a dick, make your kidney shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I wear thirteens, know what I mean?
I'll fuck around and hit you with the Hennessy dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit (See shit)
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder
It doesn't matter, skinny or fat or light-skinned or black
Baby, I drop these Boricua mamis screaming ¡Ay papi!
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they rolled proper
Look, I gotcha caught up with the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote a four-four
For niggas getting mad 'cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with G, you see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Getting physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So give me a ho, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her 'til her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-Town in ya, you want that old thing back
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance
I got that good dick, girl, you didn't know?
Oh, Biggie, give me one more chance

Is my mind playing tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, having nightmares of girls killing me?
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past, let's dwell on the 500SL, the E&J and ginger ale
The way my pockets swell to the rims with Benjamins
Another honey's in the crib? Please, send her in
I fuck non-stop, lick my lips a lot
Used to lick the clits a lot, but licking clits had to stop
'Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down below
Peep the funk flow
Really, though, I got the cleanest, meanest penis
You never seen this stroke of genius
So take off your Timb boots and your body suit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex get rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase 'em, I replace 'em
And if I'm caressing 'em I'm undressing 'em
Fuck what you heard, who's the best in New York?

Who the fuck is this, pagin' me at 5:46 in the morning?
Crack of dawn and now I'm yawnin'
Wipe the cold out my eye
See who's this pagin' me and why
It's my nigga, Pop from the barbershop
Told me he was in the gambling spot and heard the intricate plot
Of niggas wanna stick me like flypaper, neighbor
Slow down, love, please chill, drop the caper
Remember them niggas from the hill up in Brownsville
That you rolled dice with, smoked blunts and got nice with?
Yeah, my nigga Fame up in Prospect
Nah, them my niggas, nah, love, wouldn't disrespect
I didn't say them
They schooled me to some niggas that you knew from back when
When you was clockin' minor figures
Now they heard you're blowin' up like nitro
And they wanna stick the knife through your windpipe slow
So, thank Fame for warnin' me, 'cause now I'm warnin' you
I got the MAC, nigga, tell me what you gonna do

Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my paper

And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down

Call the coroner!
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin' and flower-bringin'
If my burglar alarm starts ringin'
What ya think all the guns is for?
All-purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door
And I feed 'em gunpowder so they can devour
The criminals tryin' to drop my decimals
Damn, niggas wanna stick me for my cream
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem
It's the ones that smoke blunts with ya, see your picture
Now they wanna grab they guns and come and get ya
Bet ya Biggie won't slip
I got the Calico with the black talons loaded in the clip
So I can rip through the ligaments
Put the fuckers in a bad predicament
Where all the foul niggas went
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta
Buck what I'ma hit you with, you motherfuckers better duck
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains
Of his jacket, he had a gun, he shoulda packed it
Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket
So I can reload and explode on your asshole
I fuck around and get hardcore
C-4 to your door, no beef no more, nigga
Feel the rough, scandalous
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew
What you gonna do when Big Poppa come for you?
I'm not runnin', nigga, I bust my gun and
Hold on, I hear somebody comin'

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I know how it feel to wake up fucked up
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell
People look at you like you's the user
Sellin' drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser
But they don't know about your stress-filled day
Baby on the way, mad bills to pay
That's why you drink Tanqueray, so you can reminisce
And wish you wasn't livin' so devilish, shit
I remember I was just like you
Smokin' blunts with my crew, flippin' over 62's
'Cause G-E-D wasn't B-I-G
I got P-A-I-D, that's why my moms hate me
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt
Then I figured out nicks went for 20s down South
Packed up my tools for my raw power move
Glock 19 for casket and flower moves
For chumps tryin' to stop my flow
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy
Went to see Papi to cop me a brick
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin' to hear it
Smokin' mad Newports 'cause I'm due in court
For an assault that I caught in Bridgeport, New York
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man
You better have your gat in hand, 'cause man

I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I had the master plan, I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland
With my man Two-TECs to take over this projects
They call him Two-TECs, he tote two TECs
And when he start to bust, he like to ask, ""Who's next?""
I got my honey on the Amtrak with the crack
In the crack of her ass, two pounds of hash in the stash
I wait for hon to make some quick cash
I told her she could be lieutenant, bitch got gassed
At last, I'm literally loungin', black
Sittin' back, countin' double digit thousand stacks
Had to re-up, see what's up with my peeps
Toyota deal-athon had it cheap on the Jeeps
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread
Last I heard I was dead, with six to the head
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter
Heard TEC got murdered in a town I never heard of
By some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three
Until then I looks out for the whole family
A true G, that's me, blowin' like a bubble
In the everyday struggle
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)
I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

I'm seein' body after body and our mayor Giuliani
Ain't tryin' to see no black man turn to John Gotti
My daughter use a potty so she's older now
Educated street knowledge, I'ma mold her now
Trick a little dough buyin' young girls fringes
Dealin' with the dope fiend binges, seein' syringes
In the veins, hard to explain how I maintain
The crack smoke make my brain feel so strange
Breakin' days on the set, no sweat
Drunk off Moët, can't bag yet because it's still wet
But when that dry, baggin' five at a time
I can clock about nine on the check cashin' line
I had the first and the third, rehearse, that's my word
Thick in the game, D's knew my first name
Should I quit? Shit no, even though they had me scared
Yo, they got a eight, I got a TEC with air holes
And that's just how the shit go in the struggle, motherfucker
Hah, come on, what you say?

I don't wanna live no more
Sometimes I hear death knockin' at my front door
I'm livin' every day like a hustle, another drug to juggle
Another day, another struggle (Right)

Baby, look at me
Mama love you
And I know you ain't no little boy no more
But you'll always be my baby
It seems like only yesterday I was holding you in my arms
Now look at you now, Biggie
But I worry about you
I worry about you all the time
Hangin' out on the corner
All times at night with the cruel people
Baby, that ain't nothin' but trouble
I always taught you that you could have whatever you dream
Well, I want you to hold onto that dream, baby
Hold on to it real tight, ‘cause the sky's the limit

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
How's everybody doin' tonight? (Alright)
I'd like to welcome to the stage (Alright, alright)
The lyrically acclaimed, ha (Woo)
I like this young man, because when he came out (Hahahaha)
He came out with the phrase:
He went from ashy to classy — haha, I like that (Alright, alright)

The pinstripes and the gray
The one I wore on Mondays and Wednesdays
While niggas flirt, I'm sewin' tigers on my shirts, and alligators
You wanna see the inside? Huh, I see ya later
Here comes the drama
""Oh, that's that nigga with the fake""
Blaow! ""Why you punch me in my face?"" Stay in your place
Play your position (Uh), here come my intuition (Uh-huh)
Go in this nigga pocket, rob him while his friends watchin'
And hoes clockin', here comes respect
His crew's your crew, or they might be next
Look at they man eye, big man, they never try
So we rolled with 'em, stole with 'em
I mean loyalty, niggas bought me milks at lunch
The milks was chocolate, the cookies — butter crunch
'88 Oshkosh and blue and white dunks, pass the blunt

I was ashamed, my crew was lame
I had enough heart for most of 'em
Long as I got stuff from most of 'em
It's on, even when I was wrong, I got my point across
They depicted me the boss, of course
My orange box-cutter make the world go round
Plus I'm fuckin', bitches ain't my homegirls now
Start stackin', dabbled in crack, gun packin'
Nickname Medina, make the seniors tote my ninas
From gym class to Inglés, pass off a global
The only nigga with a mobile, can't you see like Total
Gettin' larger in waists and tastes
Ain't no tellin' where this felon is headin', just in case
Keep a shell at the tip of your melon, clear the space
Your brain was a terrible thing to waste
'88 on gates, snatch initial name plates
Smokin' spliffs with niggas, real-life beginner killers
Prayin' God forgive us for being sinners, help us out

After realizin', to master enterprisin'
I ain't have to be in school by ten, I then
Begin to encounter with my counterparts
On how to burn the block apart
Break it down into sections, drugs by the selections
Some use pipes, others use injections
Syringe sold separately, Frank the Deputy
Quick to grab my Smith & Wesson like my dick was missin'
To protect my position, my corner, my lair
While we out here, say the Hustler's Prayer:
""If the game shakes me or breaks me
I hope it makes me a better man, take a better stand""
Put money in my mom's hand
Get my daughter this college plan so she don't need no man
Stay far from timid, only make moves when your heart's in it
And live the phrase ""Sky's the limit""

Hmm, yeah
Uh, the act of making love— (Haa)
What took you so long to answer motherfucker?
I don't know
The fuck wrong with you, bitch?

When I met you, I admit, my first thoughts was to trick
You look so good, huh, I'll suck on your daddy's dick
I never felt that way in my life
It didn't take long before I made you my wife
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze
Comin' to the crib, even had a set of keys
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin' rich
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right

With a bop just as strong as me
Totin' guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet
Throwin' my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows
I see my Polos and Timbos
Hide my car keys so I can't leave
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly
She'll invite me, politely, to fight, G

Didn't hesitate to squeeze to get my life out of danger
One day, she put 911 on the pager
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major
No response, the phone just rung
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem
When I pulled up, police was on the scene
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes
It didn't take long before the tears start
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart
And I know it was meant for me
I guess the niggas felt they had to kill the closest one to me
And when I find 'em your life is to an end

I was a terror since the public school era
Bathroom passes, cutting classes, squeezing asses
Smoking blunts was a daily routine
Since 13, a chubby nigga on the scene
I used to have the tré-deuce
And the deuce-deuce in my bubblegoose
Now I got the Mac in my knapsack
Lounging black, smoking sacks up in Ac's and Sidekicks
With my sidekicks, rocking fly kicks
Honeys want to chat
But all we wanna know is where the party at
And can I bring my gat?
If not, I hope I don't get shot
Better throw my vest on my chest, 'cause niggas is a mess
It don't take nothing but fronting for me to start something
Bugging and bucking at niggas like I was duck hunting
Dumbing out, just me and my crew
'Cause all we wanna do is

And party and bullshit

Said he had beef, asked me if I had my piece
Sure do, two .22s in my shoes
Holler if you need me, love, I'm in the house
Roam and stroll, see what the honeys is about
Moët popping, ho hopping
Ain't no stopping Big Poppa
I'm a Bad Boy
Niggas wanna front, who got your back? (Biggie!)
Niggas wanna flex, who got the gat? (Biggie!)
It ain't hard to tell, I'm the East Coast overdose
Nigga, you scared, you're supposed to
Nigga, I toast ya, put fear in your heart
Fuck up the party before it even start
Pissy drunk, off the Henny and skunk
On some Brand Nubian shit beating down punks

Bitches in the back looking righteous
In a tight dress, I think I might just
Hit her with a little Biggie 101, how to tote a gun
And have fun with Jamaican rum
Conversation, blunts in rotation
My man Big Jock got the Glock in his waist and
We're smoking, drinking, got the hooker thinking
If money smell bad, then this nigga Biggie stinking
Is it my charm? I got the hookers eating out my palm
She grabbed my arm and said ""Let's leave calm""
I'm hitting skins again
Rolled up another blunt, bought a Heineken
Niggas start to loc out, a kid got choked out
Blows was thrown and a fucking fight broke out

(Music stops
Indecipherable sounds of people yelling and arguing
Biggie breaks it up yelling ""Yo, chill, man, chill!"")

Can't we just all get along?
So I can put hickies on her chest like Little Shawn
Get her pissy drunk off of Dom Pérignon
And it's on, and I'm gone
That's that...

Who y'all talkin' to, man?
Ugh! Check it out, check it out
This here goes out to all the niggas that be fuckin' mad bitches
In other niggas' cribs
Thinkin' shit is sweet
Nigga creep up on yo' ass, hahaha!
Live niggas respect it
Check it

I kick flows for ya, kick down doors for ya
Even left all my motherfuckin' hoes for ya
Niggas think Frankie pussy-whipped
Nigga, picture that, with a Kodak, Insta-mat-tac
We don't get down like that, lay my game down quite flat
""Sweetness, where you parked at?""
Petiteness, but that ass fat
She got a body make a nigga wanna eat that — I'm fuckin' wit' you
The bitch official, though
Dick harder than a missile, yo
Try to hit it, if she trippin', disappearin' like Arsenio
Yo, the bitch push a double-O with the 5 in front
Probably a connivin' stunt
Y'all drive in front, I'ma peel with her, find a deal with her
She fuck around and steal, huh?!
Then we all get laced
Televisions, Versace heaven, when I'm up in 'em
The shit she kicked, all that shit's legit
She get dick from a player off the New York Knicks
Nigga trick ridiculous, the shit was plush
She's stressin' me to fuck, like she was in a rush
We fucked in his bed, quite dangerous
I'm in his ass while he playin' 'gainst the Utah Jazz
My 112 CD blast, I was past
She came twice, I came last, roll the grass
She giggle, sayin', ""I'm smokin' on homegrown""
Then I heard a moan, ""Honey, I'm home!""
Yup! Tote chrome for situations like this
I'm up in his broad, I know he won't like this
Now I'm like, ""Bitch, you better talk to him
Before this fifth put a spark to him""
Fuck around, shit get dark to him, put a part through him
Lose a major part to him — arm, leg
She beggin' me to stop, but this cat gettin' closer
Gettin' hot like a toaster, I cock the toast, ugh!
Before my eyes could blink
She screams out, ""Honey, bring me up somethin' to drink!""
He go back downstairs, more time to think
Her brain racin', she's tellin' me to stay patient
She don't know I'm cool as a fan
Gat in hand, I don't wanna blast her man
But I can and I will, though
I'm tryna chill, though
Even though situation lookin' kinda ill, yo
It came to me like a song I wrote
Told the bitch, ""Gimme your scarf, pillowcase and rope""
Got dressed quick, tied the scarf around my face
Roped the bitch up, gagged her mouth with the pillowcase
Played the cut, nigga comin' off some Love Potion shit
Flash the heat on 'em, he stood emotionless
Dropped the glass, screamin', ""Don't blast, here's the stash!
A hundred cash! Just don't shoot my ass, please!""
Nigga pullin' mad G's out the floor
Put stacks in a Prada knapsack, hit the door
Grab the keys to the 5, call my niggas on the cell
""Bring some weed, I got a story to tell""

Now in my younger days, I used to sport a shag
When I went to school, I carried lunch in a bag
With a apple for my teacher 'cause I knew I'd get a kiss
Always got mad when the class was dismissed
But when it was in session, I always had a question
I would raise my hand to make her stagger to my desk and
Help me with my problem, it was never much
Just a trick to smell her scent and try to sneak a touch
Oh, how I wish I could hold her hand and give her a hug
She was married to the man, he was a thug
His name was Lee, he drove a Z
He'd pick her up from school promptly at three o'clock
I was on her jock, yes indeedy, I wrote graffiti on the bus
First I'd write her name, then carve a plus
With my name last, on the looking glass
I seen her yesterday, but still, I had to let her pass
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass—

When I dream of fairytales, I think of me and Shelly
See, she's my type of hype and I can't stand when brothers tell me
That I should quit chasin' and look for something better
But the smile that she shows makes me a go-getter
I haven't gone as far as asking if I could get with her
I just play it by ear and hope she gets the picture
I'm shooting for her heart, got my finger on the trigger
She could be my broad and I could be her nigga, but
All I could do was stare
Back as kids we used to kiss when we played truth or dare
Now she's more sophisticated, highly edu-ma-cated
Not at all overrated, I think I need a prayer
To get in her book and it looks rather dry
I guess a twinkle in her eye is just a twinkle in her eye
Although she's crazy stepping, I'll try and stop her stride
'Cause I won't have no more of this passin' me by

Time for me to voice my opinion, can't be pretending she didn't have me
Sprung like a chicken, chasing my tail like a doggie
She was kind of like a star, thinking I was like a fan
Damn, she looked good, downside, she had a man
He was a rooty-toot, a nincompoop
She told me, ""Soon your little birdie's gonna fly the coop""
She was a flake like corn and I was born not to understand
By letting her pass, I proved to be a better man
She keeps on passin' me by (Passing me by)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me—

Now there she goes again, the dopest Ethiopian
And now the world around me begins moving in slow motion when-
Ever she happens to walk by, why does the apple of my eye
Overlook and disregard my feelings no matter how much I try?
Wait, no, I did not really pursue my little princess with persistence
And I was so low-key that she was unaware of my existence
From a distance I desired her, secretly admired her
Wired her a letter to get her, and it went
""My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me, but I know you
Very well, now let me tell you 'bout the feelings I have for you
When I try or make some sort of attempt, I simp
Damn, I wish I wasn't such a wimp
'Cause then I would let you know that I love you so and if I was your man, then I would be true
The only lying I would do is in the bed with you""
Then I signed ""Sincerely, the one who loves you dearly, P.S. Love Me Tender""
The letter came back three days later ""Return to Sender"", damn
She keeps on passin' me by
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on passin' me by (Nevertheless, I'll say it again)
She keeps on pass—
Nevertheless, I'll say it again (Passing me by)
Nevertheless, I'll say it again
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless—
Nevertheless, I'll say it again

She keeps passin' me by
She keeps passin' me by (I'll say it again)

I must admit on some occasions
I went out like a punk and a chump
Or a sucka or something to that effect
Respect I used to never get
Cause all I got was upset
When niggas used to be like
(""What's up, fool?! Nigga, what's up?!"")
And tried to sweat a nigga like the Lip
For no reason at all, I can recall niggas throwing Cs in my face
Down the hall, I'm kickin' it in the back of the school eating chicken at three
Wondering, ""Why is everybody always pickin' on me?""
I tried to talk and tell them, chill, I did nothin' to deserve this
But when it didn't work, I wasn't scared, just real nervous and unprepared
To deal with scrappin' no doubt
My pappy never told me how to knock a nigga out
But now in '95, I must survive as a man on my own
Fuck around with Fatlip, yes, ya get blown

Can't depend on friends to help you in a squeeze
Please, they got problems of their own
Down for the count on seven chickenshits don't get to heaven
Til they faced these fears in these fear zones
Used to get jacked back up in high school, I played it cool
Just so some real shit won't get full blown bein' where I'm from
They let the smoke come quicker than an evil redneck
Could lynch a helpless colored figure and
As a victim I invented low-key
Till the keyhole itself got lower than me
So I stood up and let my free form form free
Said I'm gonna get some before they knockin' out me
I don't sweat it, I let the bullshit blow in the breeze
In other words, just debris

Heavy as boulders, but I told y'all

And that's all I showed ya
And that's all I sold ya
And all this calamity is rippin' my sanity

Hung out to dry

Ravine of all things it's a vain of a shrine
All missions impossible are possible, 'cause I'm
Headed for a new sector 365
Days from now, I'll wipe the sweat from my eye
And each and every true will stick or fall from the skies

From homies all the way to chicks, no matter how fine
Controlling is a swollen way to wreck a proud mind
You hold it in your hands and watch a man start crying
Tear after tear in the puppet man's hands
Every time you take a stance you do the puppet man's dance
And the world's at a standstill, deep in broken-man's-ville
Trapped in the moat with an anvil, still
Killing yourself, and dogging ya health
You ain't amphibious, so grab a hold of yourself

Toxic slick to shock sick like electrocute

On those that pollute, extra dosages is what I gotta give 'em
Got 'em mad and tremblin'

Missiles to bomb the enemy
Because they envy me and the making of my mad currency
Currently I think we're in a state of an emergency
'Cause niggas done sold their souls, and now their souls is hollow
And I think they can't follow
They can't swallow the truth because it hurts

I seen her in the back of Taco Bell with handcuffs
The sad fact (What?), your mama smokes crack (What?)
She got a burning yearning and there's no turning back
Her knuckles drag down to the ground when she walk
Spit comes out that bitch mouth when she talk

Naked on a mountaintop, tooting on a flizute
Riding on a horse, drinking whiskey out a bizoot
She got the wings and teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that

She may have the muscles, but no, she's not cute

'Cause you was beatboxin' for Lou Rawls
In some bright red boxer drawers

They thought I was lost, but I was caught by the G-strap
Heaven forbid a giant fart would give way
'Cause that would blow me 'round the world in a day
We drove into the drive-in and she didn't have to pay
Because we dressed her up to look just like a Chevrolet

Naked on a mountaintop, tooting on a flizute
Riding on a horse, drinking whiskey out a bizoot
With the wings and the teeth of an African bat
Her middle name is Mudbone, and on top of all that
Your mama's got an afro with a chinstrap
(Your mama's got an afro with a chinstrap)
I said your mama's got an afro with a chinstrap
(Your mama, your mama, your mama)
Your mama got snakeskin teeth
Your mama wears coat hangers for earrings, dude, she looks like
Your mama was making sex threats to Ricky Bell and shit
Nah, your mama jacked the Kool-Aid man for a sip, nigga
Your mama was walking down on Sunset with a ninety-nine-cent sign on her back, dude
You're a sellout
Your mama's a sellout, nigga, your mama
Nigga, your mama did a pop tune, nigga
Your mama's glasses are so thick she could look into a map and see people wavin' at her
Your mother got an Ouija board on her back
Sidney with EQ and everything she keep sayin'
His mother be hooked, fishin' with a hook and reel at the frozen food section
Tre's mama got Play-Doh teeth
Your mother be eatin' Daytons like Now and Laters and shit
Your mama's an extra on The Simpsons and shit
Your mama's so fat you can't even see her legs
It just look like she's just gliding across the floor8Embed",https://images.genius.com/57f34813a4499d4bd8616a4698bfe331.480x480x1.jpg

Uh, little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer
Oh, how I tossed that ass up
Like a mission in the woods, Woody Woodpecker would
If he could, but I didn't wanna pass it up
To the next man, had my Walkman bumpin'
On the fifty yard line and my adrenaline pumpin'
Like a killer thriller, driller tiller, out with the Miller brew
Fill her up, took it 'til the damn Dutch puked
Luke Skywalker ain't a sweet talker, so I got ill
With my lightsaber that came in one fancy flavor
My strange behavior led to an outburst
The night felt good but the day got worse
I thought I was alone, Slim Tre the stowaway
With a brown-eyed bombshell that was dope enough to pay
I looked over my shoulder and my cover was peeled
By my whole school saying, ""Ooh,"" and I'm busted for real

What to say the least
I'm so slick that they need to call me, ""Grease""
'Cause I slips and I slides
When I rides on the beast
Imani and your mom, sittin' in a tree
K-I-S-S (I-N-G)
Yo, first comes the tongue, and then comes the she
My homey's M-O-M, what? (M-I-E)
Yo, and to think to day one
In my eyes, I show fear
'Cause I stepped into his house
His mom's grinnin' ear-to-ear
Gigglin' and winks for weeks
I would encounter from this female
She's sizin' me up for the kill
""Oh, what the hell,"" is what I said to myself
So that I wouldn't worry
I'm sittin' on the couch
And wish Greg would please hurry, what? (Up)
She offered me a cup of Ripple
Broke out the titty, squeezed her nipples
Said, ""Suck it if you like, but please don't bite it""
I had an urge to say, ""Fuck it,"" but I knew I had to fight it
Before I could say, ""Alakazam, carpet now""
I took this old bitch in the doggie style
Greg walked in the room, that nigga cold had a fit, yo
But all this numbskull could say was, ""Oh, shit""

One fine summertime, Sunday evening
Crenshaw Boulevard was in full swing
Perfect example of how looks can be deceiving
Rolled up to what I thought was a pretty young thing
Rollin' in a purple Samurai Suzuki
Dookie braids was the aid to her sex appeal
Dude, she was dope
Man, real dope, on the real
Well anyway, I went, ""Toot-toot""
She said, ""Hey, beep, beep""
The next day, rolled down to the beach
Tuesday, me and my new Crenshaw cutie
Coolin' on the beach and now she's rubbin' on my booty
Suck-suck-suckin' on my neck like Dracula
But it wasn't all that spectacular (Why?)
'Cause every time I tried to touch upon her tay-titty
She would be like, ""Quit, hehe""
Bitch was frontin', but I didn't say nothin'
Then all of a sudden, after someone pushed the button
I got a funny feeling like something was real wrong
Looked at her shoes and her feets was real long
Then it hit me, ""Oh, please, God, no""
Don't let this ho turn out to be a John Doe
He pulled a fast one on me, yo
I guess that's one of those things that make you go

Yeah, bam, bam, bam, hey, hey, what's up? Yeah
We was like that, you know?
Yeah, now you got laid back
Yeah, I'ma uh, I'ma just sit in here for a couple of hours
Man, don't sweat it, yo, we gonna catch some stuff, dude
Oh no, I'm kinda tired
Nah, we got a basket, we gon' fill this basket before we go, yo
Aight, bro
'Cause the other fish is better

It took a second to register up in my branium
My dome, my head, my skull, my cranium
My eyes have had enough, it was time to do some talking
I had to creep through the hound dogs that were stalking
This slimmy caught me peeping
This means she wasn't sleeping on who I was
So she crept in like a hawk
In a minute's time, we adjourned to the floor
Ooh, I hit a high note 'cause of the way that she was walking
We got into the groove, I didn't bust no, uh, hip-hop moves
I just kept it nice and smooth
Next thing you know, we got together, word, I thought we'd be forever
Didn't have an umbrella, now I'm soaked in stormy weather
Whether two birds of a feather fly or fall it'll be together
Never simp, pimp, and leave your love life limp
There'll be no suicide attempts for this slim-trim kid
'Cause you know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You might also like
In the sea, in the sea, that is

You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish in the sea

I reminisce, try to clear up all the myths
For an imaginary kiss with you again
Not even friends, though I wish that I could mend
Like a tailor and be Olive Oyl's number one sailor
I ams what I am, still I falls like an anvil
She's heavy on the mind, sometimes it's more than I can handle
But men aren't supposed to tumble into the den
Be macho, but a honcho like Pancho will give in
Family oriented, but not Oriental
A dame is supposed to claim you even if you drive a Pinto
A hero is a sandwich and a Manwich is a meal
A marriage is a paper; are they fakin' or for real?
What's the deal, dabbers? Will you go tumbling after
Your man and take a stand or will you help him roll faster?
The reason why I ask you is because I'm sick of this
Bitch licking drip drip from a nigga's benefits
He doesn't even suit you and he's surely not your size
I'm surprised that you slept on a heart that's worldwide
And when you open up your eyes, babe mermaid, I really wish
That you don't bruise a limb as I swim with other fish in the sea
In the sea, that is
In the sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
In the sea, in the sea that is
You know there's other fish, in the sea, that is
You know there's other fish in the sea

Now, if there ain't no mountain high enough
Why ain't you climbing up?
My hand has been extended ever since the day I lent it to ya
I thought I knew ya, but I didn't even know ya
Bro, you're stupid 'cause you thought you captured Cupid
And you found that love ain't two bits of shit
So I resign and quit
It ain't even about the hips or the lips or the tits or
Even the pussy whip, Elizabeth, this is it
Because I slipped and I tripped into a shoe that didn't fit
And now the next man is stealing my heart away
I'd charge him like a bull, but his pull never fades me
The kid is going crazy, they stepping with my lady
They're working on a baby, I'm pushing up the daisies
But hey diddle diddle, I won't play second fiddle
To no man and stand firm on this
And seal up on the bliss with a big juicy kiss
Just call me Big Gibraltar, miss
No, I won't diss, I'm just like off to other fish in the sea

Uh, do you take, Rhymealinda
(Do you love me, Tre?)
To be your lawfully wedded wife? (Do you really love me?)
Uh, uh
I do, I do, no, I don't, I do

Ah, roomie-zoom-zoom, I'm off to be wed
To Rhymealinda, I remember, um, when we first met
In '82, back in school, used to play up all the fools
Sometimes, you'd be my number five, sometimes you'd be my twenty-two
But, um, screw the dumb shit, 'cause little Rhymea's true
I can't wait to say ""I do,"" and oh yeah, honey, there's no due
I got my chariot rollin', now I'm mic controlling
Got some spunk in my funk, I can't wait to put some soul in
We're rollin' all strikes, we're havin' little tykes
One is little Mike, the other's Ike, I'm sure that you would like
To hold 'em, or maybe stroll 'em on their little bikes
When they're born, I've sworn, to bring 'em up right, you know
Dope is how I breed em, beats is what I'll feed em
They'll be healthy like a health nut, I'm sure you'll shake your butt
Kick the verse, preacher, and I won't disperse
Here's my life, Rhymealinda, for better or for worse

And you don't stop, you don't stop (What?)
And you don't stop, you don't stop (What?)
And you don't stop, you don't stop (What?)
You don't, stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop (What?)
And you don't stop, and you don't stop (What?)
And you don't stop, you don't stop (What?)
And you don't stop

Well, it's done, she tagged me, duck, duck, goose
I'm batter up, I can't sleep, the fly brother must produce
The power pack and I'm stacked like a forty-five mag
Straight up tennis shoes, in my pants, there's a sag
Droppin' so much grammar, gotta slam it down my mouth
Shit, I met a slut, she put me in a rut, G
With the dip that was down with me from the homefront
Now front me never, too cool, however
I gotta get the bread (Bread), gotta get the butter (Butter)
Fix it up, eat it down, throw it in the gutter
(Gutter dreamed it), sour (Creamed it), gotta
Skinny-dipped into her ass as if it was a pool of water
Now the water's gettin hotter, so I bought her a new ring
Maybe a love ballad is the song I sing
I gotta kiss her ass, my tongue I hold before I curse
If you really want me, bitch, take me for better or for worse

And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
And you don't stop, and you don't stop
Well, this is the final chapters (Hello?)
Of me, so we're going to rack up (Who is this?)
In tune, in tune, in tune, a button (Why are you calling my house, who is this?)
A button, a button, Oh c'mon, honey (What?)
Would you come along with me down the lane? (Mike, is that you?)
And I will pick your brain (Oh my God, who is this?)
I won't pick it like you think I will (I'll fucking call the cops, don't call my house)
I'll take a hammer and start to drill (Oh my God, what is this?)
Your skull, and then I'll really start pickin'
Your brains out (What?), I will be lickin' (I'm gonna call the cops, okay? Quit fucking around)
You taste so intelligent (Hello, who is this?)
Ah, yes, yes, yes
You trusted me, now I busted the (Help, who is this?)
Top of your skull (What are you doing? Why are you calling me?)
You thought today was going to be dull?
But it was very exciting
I took your fingers then I started biting (Who are you? Why are you calling my house?)
And then I scraped the meat off the bone (Stop calling here)
Of your leg (Don't call here anymore)
You tried to make me beg
But I had to insist, I had to insist, I (Oh my God)
Went up your pussy with my fist (Ahh)
Okay, I think we've gone a little bit overboard (I'm gonna call the cops)
Don't stop it yet (Fuck you, don't call my house)
Like this (Like what? Like what? Like what?)
Like this (Like what? Like what? Like what?)
Like this (Like what? Like what? Like what?)

Yo, I'm Audi Geee
No copies manufactured
No, uh, copies, we can't, uh, do the copies
No copies, okay

That's what it is, huh?
Is that what you want? What you talkin' 'bout?
What you talkin' 'bout, nigga?
What you know about the problems in LA?
I'ma tell you what's wrong with the problems of the people in LA
See, the brothers need some type of education
And you know, some type of foundation, in the, uh, community
'Cause the mute-cuh—, duh, the community grows like seeds
And the seeds will not fall from the tree if you don't water the grass
So, nigga, get off your rusty Black ass

I guess everybody needs somebody to love
You can't leave love lonely
Cause being naive to it you can just lose it like that
See kisses for bruises don't make it heal back
It be's the sex appeal that's from the next and not necessarily the sex and
One might appeal to the intellect having a greater affect on how they feelin'
Stimulation breaking down their shields for the real and
As it stands mysteriously curiosity it kills the cat and
Offsets them mentally so they're trapped in behind
These fantasies with no action searching for a remedy
Now she loves her man but there is just a different type of chemistry
That flairs when her desires on fire
Quick is the fuse, another loves for hire

And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish

I was high like the vocal tone of my nigga Bootie Brown
Decided to take a ride to see what's really going down
Up on the North side of town
Of course I bought a quarter pound
Of bomb hemp, feeling alright like Johnny Kemp
On a Friday night
Looking right cause my shit is tight
Blazing blunts to city lights on Sunset and Crescent Heights
Bounce to the House of Blues then I slid in free
With tennis shoes, sweatshirt, jeans, and no ID
Soon as I step inside the plizace I recognize the fizace
Of an ep with an iz-ass more amazing than grace
So I waste no time to kick my line
I say, ""How ya doing?"" She say, ""I'm doin' fine""
So I commence to macking to baby to see what's cracking
So maybe I get her back at the cabin and start attacking
Threw back a shot of yack and started jabbering
Jibbing, fibbin, and ad libbing just to get her to my crib then
We was chilling on the bed, bumping some Isley
Thought I was about to spread the thighs but she surprised me
When she said, ""Oh like that? You know I don't get down.""
I know my homies gonna clown cause I let her stick around when—

And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
And she said...
It'll be good if you stayed with me tonight
So I granted her wish
Now Daddy's home
But she's been waitin all night so we could be all alone
This is an everyday thing so we hang out by the phone
Trying to build something real, working fingertips to the bone
So much love's gone astray that it won't be coming home
No time soon
So I dance with the silhouette beneath the moon
And she said, if satisfaction's guaranteed
Nothing else could come between the flight of a new love baby
Maybe we could be cool
Instead of sharing this here ship with the fools
You know that, right now, right now, right now, baby
Right now, right now, right now, baby
And she said
I'll give you the world if you want it
I'll give you the world if you need it baby
And she said
You know that she said
And she said

Well, I am the nigga in charge over here
Sack the quarterback to make a cheerleader cheer
I fix my funk like Thelonious Monk
Stayin' true to the game 'cause I ain't no punk
Never been a bitch, so I don't act bitchy
Smooth on the vinyl like Lionel Richie
And for creeps who sleep, you better ring the alarm clock
Don't dig what I'm kicking? You can suck on a warm cock
Originate trends, my rhymes, they get paid
So I'm making ends and beginnings, see, I'm never afraid
Of a pancake MC 'cause I flips when I sways it
Housin' motherfuckers like a real estate agent
Douse you with my lyrical liquid for this hip-hop era
So I suggest you fetch an umbrella for my reign of terror
'Cause you can get your posse and your army brigade
Because I am not afraid
Oh, 'cause I'm the type of nigga that you never forget (What?)

That's why your mental state was fucked before you hit your mama's guts
'Cause I'm the nigga and the boss, I flip it and I toss
That time there was a quarter, only a dollar was what they cost
'Cause niggas on my Snoopy like the bird Woodstock
Get your hands off my dick because I hold this cock
It's like I'm waitin' in the distance, resisted from persistence
I'm Dirty Harry and I take your mama just for instance
'Cause I'm the type of nigga to make the fat lady sing
Hour after my flow, she wasn't shocked with my swing
But a little too much weight to be a new jack man
Got more rhythm in my toe than a whole blues band
'Cause when I rock, the people roll, when I recite from my scroll
Play the beat, nigga, forever mind, body, and soul

Um, um, well, excuse me
Um, um, well, excuse me
Um, um, well, excuse me (Who is the nigga in charge over here?)

I dedicate this to buddah
This is our song dedicated to smokin' weed
'Cause we smoke lots of mad weed all the time (Mad, mad, mad)
So Tre, Tre (We got what you want, Copenhagen)
Since we smoke a lot of mad weed (Give the people buddah)
Indo, gentlemen (Yeah, um, hahaha)
You must love the buddah (Listen, man, your mama's weed theme is hip-hop)
You gotta smoke some bomb, man

Trapped in the cockpit at forty thousand feet
The sky is the limit, but we supersede
The greed for the speed is, like, way beyond limits
I grab my parachute with, like, forks and spoons in it
And I'm falling, I'm falling, my heart rapid rushes
Death before my eyes, oh, why did I trust this?
My reactions are repeated over and over and over
Oh, it seems like I will never be sober

Pack it up, pack it in (I get high, I love gettin' high)
Pack it up, pack it in (I'ma get high 'til I die)
Pack it up, pack it in (Can I have a light? Where is my bud?)

The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe

I look in every hip-hop magazine, it seems
That the blunts are being passed around the scenes in teams
And the ganja man with contraband in lesser amounts
I guess 'cause understands he has his chance, he passes like Fouts
But his pass is incomplete, 'cause I can tell in the smell
To let the dutchy pass me by, let the left catch hell
If I wanted to smoke tobacco, I'd get a skinny white bitch
I know that Fatlip carries a pack to cure the nicotine itch
Because the only itch I have is for the indo or sess
So don't pass me that mess or try to even protest
That it's adding to the flavor 'cause the old one was fine
Won't you pack the pipe and keep it moving down the line?

The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe

I got a big ol' blunt, I'm lampin' on my front porch
About to put a torch to it, then Coco said, ""Don't do it
Please don't hit that shit in front of my little four year old son""
She sent him inside the house, meanwhile, my Sheri steadily rolled one
After the other, then another 'cause I'm rollin' in the dough
So we rolling the indo as if the kid didn't know
He's lookin' through the window, yo, why we tryna hide it?
To make a boy grow to be ignorant and misguided
About the bud? Now I have to play the part of the adviser
Because the bud is just a tasty tantalizer
The bud, not the beer, 'cause the bud makes me wiser (Figaro)
So I said, ""Come here, little man"" (What you want, little man?)
And with his little hand, he grabbed the pipe
A lesson in buddah blessin', not too young, just right
So he started blazin', it was amazin'
My lungs are black and shriveled up like a raisin
But who am I to deny the kid a try
At nature's little way of sayin' hi? (Thank you, old man)
So pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe
The pipe, the pipe (Pack it up, pack it in)
Let's pack the pipe

Twisting, turning, burning, rings of fire when I come into your lair
Say you'll pay a fare for the fee
I see the pipe, the pipe is what I like
I'm Imani and I'm hype, give me the pipe tonight
I really wanna smoke it, I really want to smoke it
I choke it
The endo no jokin', I'm doin' it like this
I hope I do not get this by anybody (Yo, where's Quinton?)

By anybody (Quinton, Quinton, where are you?)
By anybody (Yo)
By anybody (Quinton, Quinton, come here)
What? Uh-huh, uh-huh (Who got a lighter? Imani's got a lighter)
Ah, kick somethin' on the mic
Why does your mother smoke pipe with crack on the inside?
She likes to take a bus ride with a sherm stick in her mouth, preachin' about
What in the world's goin' on, I don't know what's up
The bitch smokes a lot of heron
Every day, a hard basehead, I don't know what to say
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

So here it is, fuck it, friends or no friends
I had enough bullshit to last me clear to the ends
Of my term, I hate worms, so I'ma bring in the fish
And induce my backhand to refrain from my fist
Yeah, I wish that I changed, then I could shed all the mane
You trippin' on my ego, but all my shit is sustained
Order, order, I cross the border for a spot in the sun
I'm so down with myself, bitch, I could chill as a bum, ho hum
Drum, I'm so burnt that I'm beat
I got my peers on my nuts and the crowd on my feet
The only one who has my back is me, in reality, see
I'm constantly fighting envy when we journey through the sea
Oui, oui, monsieur, I'm true to the game, I believe, my friend, you slip me
Yeah, I might have the ego, but you'll tell me who is tripping
I know and it shows, I can look at your nose
And just tell that you're affected by the E-G-O

On the downlow
On the downlow
On the downlow

I woke up in the morning to a girl who's butt's soft
Gotta brush my teeth, clean my nuts off
Put on the gear that I'ma wear throughout my day
But before I take a shower, I ain't ashamed to say
When I think of the night before and the heat of passion
Your big brown booty, my mind starts flashin'
I'm lookin' in the mirror with my cock on rock
Should I pursue to do you or just stroke my knot?
While my girl is asleep, I'm caught in a jam
Went to the bathroom with cocoa butter in my hand
Closed the door behind me, locked it very tight
Thinkin' of all the nasty things we did last night
Slipped out my underoos, sat on the toilet bowl
And let the hand I hold the mic with take control
Closed my eyes tight so it would seem more real
I'm thinkin' about the crazy ways you made me feel
As my thoughts get deeper and a little more intense

What dug? Look under the rug and I got it
Hit him in the heart with my night stalker slug
But know, this nigga had to go
Peep this, I was asleep, he climbed in my window
Grabbed me around the neck, said, ""Scream and you're dead""
I thought it was the devil 'cause his face was glowin' red
He was a brother, but this brother had the devil in his eye
He was out to get I-M-A-N-I
First, I took my trigger finger with a wiggle
The devil jumps into my eyes and then I giggle
In the back of my head, you know Imani feels no shame
I grab my nine and said, ""Watch my millimeter go bang""
I got him, he's crippled, so he crawls across the floor
He's bleeding everywhere and now he's reachin' for the door
Bang, bang, bang, yep, I got him again
His story's soundin' sad like the movie Ben
But, um, anyway, I'm just protectin' my shit

Yo, Fatlip, man
Yo, man, they tryna run a power move on us, man
Yo, man
You got to tell the suckers what's up, boy
Yeah, haha

I got a letter from the DMV the other day
I opened and read it, it said they were suckers
They tried to tell me that my license was suspended
I got offended for a minute, then pretended
That I never even got the damn letter
It's nine o'clock on the dot, so I think I'd better
Scoot off to school, 'cause in class, there's a test
I gotta dress fast, grab my glasses and my vest
Oh damn, as hardheaded as I am
Hopped in my hooptie ride, pumped up the jam
Put it in reverse, into first, then dispersed and
From that very moment on, my day got worse

As I was standing in the street, I suddenly seen the smoke
I know that Derrick's on his way, I ran to get my coat
And a bag from the room, it took a minute, boom
Hopped into the car, we drove away in a zoom
I assume doom as we were drivin' on the gravel
At any given minute, we could have a shortened travel
So I ramble about my life, 'cause that's in shambles
Shoulda took the bus
I busted out some sandals or some old Nikes
I wish we had some good bikes
We need to exercise, maybe we could take a hike
And you could give Sheri back those car keys

Be like that, it just be like that
Baby tell me why it's gotta be like that
(x4)

I wasn't sleepin I was creepin’, slidin', hidin'
I would like the girl behind me roll up a bad time thinkin'
Mentally sinkin’, presently brinkin’
Two decades and a half makin’ a path for mine to follow
The world is hollow, yet it's full of crap prepare to gamble
I give you a handful of chips and tips
For what's to come, I cried a ton of tears
Drunk a ton of beers, that's fun at first
But learned to persevere throughout the years
Kept my ears open, eyes scoping mouth locked
Don't rock the boat if you can't swim
Nobody may be there with the limb to lend
This is the end, still I can't explain the fact
Why the fuck shit gotta be like that?


Know what, I said it
Hear me clearin' over so severe and dreaded
That they need to be beheaded
Why? I'm readily, steadily stimulating and mutilating
All sloppily copied imitations, cause they irritatin'
So I'm intimitading them over the snare
With simply a stare
Bringin them turbulent terror
And they know this ‘cause they can feel it
He knew that it was mine still the sucker tried to steal it
So I had to reveal it, through provin’
That I am astonishing and fly
And by just blinking my eye
In a flash I flush out the face, layin' low-key
Trained eyes locate to focus on the phony
Mister sometime-homey, why he act like that
I thought he had my back
I thought he had our backs
But it was him who I should've never trusted
And not at least till he got his attitude adjusted
Or mouth busted for acting all dusted, but bust this
Now when I'm out I seek and thought out the whole scene
For all sinister types, sneaks that scheme
They come into my face, I send them tightmen home
When they be suffering from the double-agent syndrome
Why it gotta be like that?

People think I'm high but I'm mentally travelling
Aging is your times cause life's unraveling
While I'm straddlin' walls up this fuckin' mic
I hate to be a pilot crashin' in a flight
People need to know about this thing called life
Cause if you see the light then life's alright
So can you dig it?


I jumps inside the jeep as I embark on my dark mission
Popped in my freestyle tapes, started reminiscing
About my little homie, who was raised in Wyoming, wanted to be famous
So he came to Californey on the microphony
He was super bad and what not
But he was the kinda fella to follow fads that was hot
He became too fascinated with that gang related flavor
That he modificated, rearranged his behavior
He hooked up quick with the influential slang
Gangsta-stroll, cornrolls; the whole shabbang
Braggin' and boastin, boastin' and braggin
How he mostly be hangin' with baby gees I was baggin'
Like why you tryin' to ride up on the bandwagon
Hopin' they'd hit him in the head, but he steady saggin'
Like he a hog
Creepin' through the smog
Smokin' on some indo sippin' on a cup of O-Dog
Like most who come to this West Coast society
Try to be because they think it's fly to be a menace
So what a relic way to end this
Got rolled up when he was strolling
On a Sunday at the Venice
Some niggas never listen they gotta learn their lesson
The hard way I'm guessin' yessin'
Deedy as I hit the Beady and make a right on Weston

You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

Let me entertain you
And interphase you, with the new sound
Sound is the side and the Phar is the cyde
And no matter who you are, you know you can't hide
Not from the eyes of the sun or the moon or the stars
No matter who you are (Da-na-na-na)
Come in, and commence to the sound of my drumming

You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

Time to go all the way with it
Don't just sit there and stare or play with it
Cause we're committed to the seeds of the new breeds
The mothership of dreams where fiends breast feed
Step through reality into reality
So surreal you'll feel you never knew reality
Until it stood still now your far from a lie
When the truth tantalizes your eyes, see we already in the skies
Or outer space, standing here on the face of this earth
To the state to the grid of my turf
Where my mom gave birth
To all that she loves
Be it small to others, but yo, it's bigger than love
They did a cross examination of it
But you can't duplicate the state of our relations through translations
That's not the ticket
Breaking codes in Heiroglyphics
Trying to get down to the specifics

Yo, when money talks fools are always checkin'
Depositing their two cents
Foolishly convinced, blinded by their ignorance
That becomes a hinderance for them to rise
When they going to recognize, time waits for no man
When you going to stand and
Get up off of that bullshit, and stop fighting that feeling?

Now let me change the topic just a bit
Talk about the ips with the fat ass and tits
Comin' to the club, looking for a star
Ain't got ten dollars for a drink at the bar
Scoping around, looking for the best dressed
Smelling for the indo passing up the stress
Sniff sniff, yo, what does the ip smell?
A brother like Suave with a pocket that swell
Action was thrown, the ip was blown
Next thing you know, I had her at my home!
All alone, object to get paid
Only thing that happened was a ass got laid!
Now no ends and her ass was sprung
Used a little tongue, but believe I'm well hung
So lesson well learned for all you club hopping hoes
It ain't about the stardom and it ain't about the dough, so
You gotta get on up off of that bullshit, stop fighting that feeling

I was standing, one of the cast of many
I would give anything to swing hand in hand
With her but it was just a blur
I couldn't blame her, why give up fortune and the fame
For a nigga who can barely afford his name
So the dame kept aim at the stars
I'm often thinking about her
When I'm waitin on calls across the border
Made sure my rhymes in order cause
That moment could be near and it was
Now my attorney is tellin' me to sign here
So I appear and perform international
The time came she stepped to me I thought rational
But she knew I wanted it
She walked around and flaunted it like a peacock
I knocked the Reebok Now she jock
Blowin up the Pactel and the doorbell
Had to check myself as well love boat won't sail
Cause I'm no captain let them know from the start
I let you break me off but I won't let you
Break my heart

So I'm surrounded by bitches
Now this is the most incredible shit in Slim Kid history
So watch if you will the moment some good
Shit pops and they be foggin up ya grill
Overly thrilled to get you in ya ass like massingil
Still burnin shit now and I'm still learnin how not to fuck
With ya baby or make ya my old lady
You just overcasting ya ass is shady tryin to block
The sunlight with all of that hype and now I'm discontinue'n
All of this pipe that I've been layin as long as you keep
Swayin to anotha crew's tempo I gotta let you go and that's
Simple so get it through ya two temples because I'm
Tryin' to live fatter than a blimp ho

She was my high school sweetheart down from start

If I could still feel the same when I came off tour
I said ""for sure"" cuz what God gave us, girl, I'm grateful
No need to be insecure baby your nigga's faithful
So now I'm off doin' dates in a gang of states
And as my status elevates I see the baddest eights
At the backstage gate lookin' great straight
Waitin for a nigga so now I figure
""Hey I only live once I'm goin' all out today""
Made a call out to L.A. to say what had to say...

The tables turned like a technique twelve hundred
Last thing in the world that I wanted was my girl goin' out every
Night gettin blunted
And zooted with a clique of well known
Reputed groupie hoes from all the hip hop shows
Backstage with her little backpack tryin to get chose
By anotha nigga with talent wealth and fame
Oh I suppose I guess I got myself to blame
For turning her out into a hip hop freak
Now I seek counseling
From a therapist twice a week
So let me speak about the freak So let me speak about the
Freak
Instantly she made another selection
Because he was in the lime plus had
The money connection ""correction""
""way more paid"" is why she laid and played
A charade in the game of deception
This Miss-mysterious mistress is just an actress
Of the mattress cuz she's a wanna be mack-tress
Well built-but equipped with the tackiest of tactics

One of the greatest in my eyes till this very day
Too young to understand but understood the ways of good and evil
Life and death was in the breath of times fate
And God only knows what kept Peggy straight
Cuz in the very next year my Aunt Dorothy was the late
More beautiful than the word it was like killing a mocking bird
She was so young like the new year was all you heard
Almost saw it so clear the good times that we had
When my Momma showed me pictures life wasn't so bad
I got baby sat By Pat when Bedie was a small guy
And in our cousins eyes we were both small fries

The way that momma raised us was pure faith
So diablo wouldn't faze us or daze us
Or lay us down to sleep
Know the wolf from the sheep
Or the sheep who cried wolf
And threw the deadly hoof
While the wolf was asleep
I keep my mind a ghost
Follow my heart the most
Don't play fools too close
Sleep with my eyes at post
So Diablo won't be hostin the game of life
The knife sits by throats of the young
And blows death straight through the lungs
As the mind gets washed by visions of sugar plums
But we shall overcome cause we ain't dumb
But we ain't smart, they got the girls by the hearts
And the niggas by the nuts
Ear, tongue and butts
Yeah, they're trying to fuck us up
But, shit, you know what's up
We gotta get with the movement
And move men soon
They consume every womb who bares
Beneath the stairs of their doom
Before they let a new soul bloom
Best believe they're gonna shove em in a tomb

Slowly broke into the kitchen
To fill a bowl with some Raisin Bran
As I ran up and down the TV stations
I witnessed Indian Joe
Getting tricked out of this nation
By a silly hillbilly
Who laughed as the shit happened
Everything's the same
The game continued into rappin
Deception is at an all-time high
You give a piece of your soul
To receive some crumbs from the pie
But you know I keep on rappin til the break of dawn
Even though it is my soul that I do not even own
Chorus: repeat 4X

I was po', black and broke
Beyond a shadow of a doubt
Ass-out, wide open waitin for my shit to come on out
Speakin about the time before I got signed

Bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka-bucka, haha!
You know the deal; it's just me, yo
Beats by Su-Primo for all of my people, Negroes and Latinos
And even the gringos

Yo, check it
1 for Charlie Hustle, 2 for Steady Rock
3 for the forth-comin' live future shock
It's 5 dimensions, 6 senses
7 firmaments of heaven and hell
8 million stories to tell
9 planets faithfully keepin' orbit, with the probable 10th
The universe expands length
The body of my text possess extra strength
Power-lift the powerless up out of this towering inferno
My ink so hot, it burn through the journal
I'm blacker than midnight on Broadway & Myrtle
Hip-Hop passed all your tall social hurdles
Like the nationwide projects-prison-industry complex
Working-class poor — better keep your alarm set
Streets too loud to ever hear freedom ring
Say evacuate your sleep, it's dangerous to dream
For ch-ching, cats get the ""Cha-pow!"" — you dead now
Killing fields need blood to graze the cash cow
It's a numbers game, but shit don't add up somehow
Like I got 16 to 32 bars to rock it
But only 15% of profits ever see my pockets
Like $69 billion in the last 20 years
Spent on national defense, but folks still live in fear
Like nearly half of America's largest cities is one-quarter black
That's why they gave Ricky Ross all the crack
16 ounces to a pound, 20 more to a ki
A 5 minute sentence hearing and you no longer free
40% of Americans own a cell phone
So they can hear everythin' that you say when you ain't home
I guess Michael Jackson was right — you are not alone
Rock your hardhat, black, 'cause you in the Terrordome
Full of hard niggas, large niggas, dice-tumblers
Young teens and prison greens facin' life numbers
Crack mothers, crack babies and AIDS patients
Young bloods can't spell, but they could rock you at PlayStation

Light in the ass with heavy steel, sights on the pretty shit in life
Young soldiers tryin' to earn they next stripe
When the average minimum wage is $5.15
You best believe you gotta find a new grind to get C.R.E.A.M
The white unemployment rate is nearly more than triple for black
Some front-liners got they gun in your back
Bubblin' crack, jewel theft and robbery to combat poverty
And end up in the global jail economy
Stiffer stipulations attached to each sentence
Budget cutbacks, but increased police presence
And even if you get out of prison still livin'
Join the other 5 million under state supervision
This is bidness; no faces, just lines and statistics
From your phone, your Zip Code, to SSI digits
The system break man, child and women into figures
2 columns for ""Who is"" and ""Who ain't"" niggas
Numbers is hard and real and they never have feelings
But you push too hard, even numbers got limits
Why did one straw break the camel's back?
Here's the secret — the million other straws underneath it

I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget

Man, duke, I was in love with this girl, duke
I was tore up, dog, I'm tellin' you, man
Shit is wild, man, for real
It's, she's from, let me tell you about her

Yo, in she came with the same type game
The type of girl givin' out the fake cellphone and name
Big fame, she like cats with big things
Jewels chipped, money clip, phone flip, the six range
I seen her on the Ave., spotted her more than once
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
She spot me like paparazzi, shot me a glance
In that Catwoman stance with the fat booty pants, hot damn!
What's your name, love? Where you came from?
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up
Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""A-yo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (Say word!)
You was the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb (Yeah, that's her)
Shocked as hell she couldn't get it together
I just played along and pretended I never met her
How you feelin'? ""Oh, I'm fine"", my name is Mos ""I'm Sharice""
I heard so much good about you, it's nice to finally meet
We moved to the booth reserved for crew especially
And honey love ended up sittin' directly next to me
I'm type polite, but now I'm lookin' at her skeptically
'Cause baby girl got all the right weaponry
Designer fabric, shoes and accessories
Chinky eyes, sweet voice is fuckin' with me mentally
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I'm 'bout to murk, I say peace to the family
She hop up like, ""How you gon' leave before you dance with me?""

I was like, yeah, aight, come on then, let's go
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell (ya)
Yo, honey was so blazin', she was just..
Yo, she looked like Jayne Kennedy, word bond, to my mother, man
She was that ill, man
She take me to the dance floor and she start whisperin' to me..

""Yo, let me apologize for the other night, I know it wasn't right
But baby, you know what it's like, some brothers don't be comin' right""
I understand, I'm feelin' you
Besides, ""Can I have a dance?"" ain't really that original
We laughed about it, traced her arms across my shoulder blades
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
Heatin' my blood up like the Arizona summer
Song finished then she whispered, ""Honey, let's exchange numbers""
Scene 3 — weeks of datin', late night conversation
In the crib, heart racin', tryin' to be cool and patient
She touched on my eyelids, the room fell silent
She walked away smilin', singin' Gregory Isaacs
Like, ""If I don't, if I don't have you""
Showin' me her tan line and her tattoo
Playin' Sade, Sweetest Taboo
Burnin' candles, all my other plans got cancelled
Man, I smashed it like a Idaho potato
She call me at my J.O., ""Come now"", I can't say no
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
Three months — she call, I feel I'm runnin' a fever
Six months — I'm tellin' her I desperately need her
Nine months — flu-like symptoms when shorty not around
I need more than to knock it down, I'm really tryin' to lock it down
Midnight, we hook up and go at it
Burn a stoge and let her know, sweetheart, I got to have it
She tellin' me commitment is somethin' she can't manage
Wake up the next mornin', she gone like it was magic
Aww, damn it! My shit is on Harrison Ford Frantic
My 911's unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, I saw Sharice at the Kittie club
With some bangin' ass Asian playin' lay it down and lick me up

Yo!

The way I feel — sometimes, it's too hard to sit still
Things are so passionate, times are so real
Sometimes I try and chill, mellow down, blowin' smoke
Smile on my face, but it's really no joke
You feel it in the street, the people breathe without hope
They goin' through the motion, they dimmin' down the focus
The focus get cleared, then the light turn sharp
And the eyes go teary, the mind grow weary
I speak it so clearly, sometimes, y'all don't hear me
I push it past the bass, know nations gotta feel me
I feel it in my bones, black
I'm so wide awake that I'm hardly ever 'sleep
My flow forever deep
And it's volumes of scriptures when I breathe on a beat
My presence speak volumes before I say a word
I'm everywhere — penthouse, pavement and curb
Cradle to the grave, tall cathedral or a cell
Universal ghetto life — holla, black, you know it well
Quiet storm, vital form, pen pushed it right across
Mind is a vital force; high, low or right across
Soul is the lion's roar, voice is the siren
I swing 'round, ring out, and bring down the tyrant
Shocked a small action knock a giant lopsided
The world is so dangerous, there's no need for fightin'
Suckers tryin' to hide like the struggle won't find 'em
Then, the sun bust through the clouds to clearly remind 'em
It's everywhere! — Penthouse, pavement and curb

You say, ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on, y'all, let's rock this!
You say, ""one for the treble, two for the time""
Come on! Speech is my hammer, bang the world into shape
Now let it fall, huh!

My restlessness is my nemesis
It's hard to really chill and sit still, committed to page
I write a rhyme, sometimes won't finish for days
Scrutinize my literature from the large to the miniature
I mathematically add-minister, subtract the wack
Selector, wheel it back, I'm feeling that
Ahaha, from the core to the perimeter black
You know the motto, stay fluid even in staccato (Mos Def)
Full-blooded, full throttle
Breathe deep inside the drum hollow... There's the hum
Young man, where you from? Brooklyn number one!
Native son, speaking in the native tongue
I got my eyes on tomorrow (There it is)
While you still tryin to find where it is
I'm on the Ave where it lives and dies, violently but silently
Shine so vibrantly that eyes squint to catch a glimpse
Embrace the bass with my dark ink fingertips
Used to speak the King's En-ga-lish
But caught a rash on my lips, so now my chat just like dis
Long range from the base-line (swish)
Move like an apparition, low to the ground with ammunition
(Chi-chi-pow) Move from the gate, voice cued
On your tape, putting food on your plate
Many crews can relate, who choosing your fate (yo)
We went from picking cotton
To chain gang line chopping, to Be-Bopping, to Hip-Hopping
Blues people got the blue chip stock option
Invisible man, got the whole world watching
(Where ya at?) I'm high, low, east, west, all over your map
I'm getting big props, with this thing called hip hop
Where you can either get paid or get shot
When your product in stock, the fair-weather friends flock
When your chart position drop, then the phone calls....
Chill for a minute, let's see who else hot, snatch your shelf spot
Don't gas yourself, akh'
The industry just a better built cell block
A long way from the shell tops
And the bells that L rocked (rock, rock, rock, rock...)
You might also like
The more emotion I put into it, the harder I rock

Hip Hop is prosecution evidence
An out of court settlement, ad space for liquor
Sick without benefits (hungh!) Luxury tenements
Choking the skyline, it's low life getting tree-top high
It is a back water remedy
Bitter and tender memory, a class E felony
Facing the death penalty (hungh!)
Stimulant and sedative, original repetitive
Violently competitive, a school unaccredited
The break beats you get broken with on time and inappropriate
Hip Hop went from selling crack to smoking it
Medicine for loneliness remind me of Thelonius and Dizzy
Propers to B-Boys getting busy
The war-time snap shot, the working man's jack-pot
A two dollar snack box sold beneath the crack spot
Olympic sponsor of the black Glock
Gold medalist in the back shot
From the sovereign state of the have-nots
Where farmers have trouble with cash crops (woooo)
It's all-city like Phase 2
Hip Hop will simply amaze you, praise you, pay you
Do whatever you say do, but, black, it can't save you16Embed",https://images.genius.com/7bc42f805aa192cfd886ce8e3f8d6846.667x667x1.jpg

Yeah
Yo, yo, what time the plane leavin'?
Alright, see you at the airport

I'm leaving, on a jet plane
I don't know if I'll be back again
Kiss me and smile for me
Tell me that you'll wait for me
Hold me, like you know I'll never go
Even though you know I will
I'm a travellin' man
Movin' through places, space and time

""Well, go 'head and leave""
The call heard around the world from the wives of MC's
These cats is payin' more than half a pound
My garment bag'll snatch it down
Ain't got the skate, but we can probably run it back in town
Scenarios like this is tear jerkers
For the modern MC, i.e. the blue collar worker
'Cause this thing called rhymin' no different from coal minin'
We both on assignments to unearth the diamond
When you start climbin', then them eyes start shinin'
You be strugglin' and strivin', and they think you prime-timin'
Maintain and keep silent, make note and observation
This confrontation, this is the daily operation
My concentration, stay focused on my recitation
'Bout to reach my destination with no pause or hesitation
Baby, make the preparation 'cause this ain't no recreation
This is pro-ball, and we lettin' you know, y'all
At the show, y'all, doin' this for dough, y'all

But God willin', I'll be back home
To drop these heavy-ass bags up off my backbone
Around the world with a catalogue of rap songs
My baby girl is walkin', been away for that long
But no, you haven't
Well, at least that's how it seem to me
My hometown is like a whole different scenery
The old timers on the stoop leanin' leisurely
The new jacks up in the parks smokin' greenery
Easily taken for granted when you up in it
But it's sweet scented, when you been down for a minute
Move around city limits, break it down with the vintage
The inovinin', classical b-boy image
Collect the winnings, 'cause it the reason that we came here
This thing is not a game here
The fortune, not the fame here
From New York to the Cackalacks
Cali and the Cadillacs
Chicago know we innovate
Infiltrate Virginia state
DC make me stimulate
Philly know we penetrate
Georgia make us generate
Let's set a date to get the papes
They celebrate to my jams in foreign lands
Even your mans in Japan know who I am
Mina-san, make everybody out in Nippon say ""ichiban""
""Me God, man, Mo', where you get it from? Phenomenon""

Bismillah ir Rahman ir Raheem
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
And I'm very happy that you came here
Ooh-oooh, whee!
That was for Brooklyn
Ha ha, we get it every time
You got me on? Oh
Shout out to all of my crew, East-West, North-South
All the continent, Europe, all abroad international
Bring it in, bring it in, bring it in, bring it in
It's a lot of things goin' on y'all
21st century is comin'
20th century almost done
A lot of things have changed
A lot of things have not, mainly us
We gon' get it together right? I believe that
Listen—people be askin' me all the time
""Yo Mos, what's gettin' ready to happen with hip-hop?""
(Where do you think hip-hop is goin'?)
I tell em, ""You know what's gonna happen with hip-hop?
Whatever's happening with us""
If we smoked out, hip-hop is gonna be smoked out
If we doin' alright, hip-hop is gonna be doin' alright
People talk about hip-hop like it's some giant livin' in the hillside
Comin' down to visit the townspeople
We are hip-hop
Me, you, everybody, we are hip-hop
So hip-hop is going where we going
So the next time you ask yourself where hip-hop is going
Ask yourself: where am I going? How am I doing?
Till you get a clear idea
So if hip-hop is about the people
And the hip-hop won't get better until the people get better
Then how do people get better? (Hmm)
Well, from my understanding people get better
When they start to understand that they are valuable
And they not valuable because they got a whole lot of money
Or 'cause somebody, think they sexy
But they valuable 'cause they been created by God
And God makes you valuable
And whether or not you recognize that value is one thing
You got a lot of societies and governments
Tryin' to be God, wishing that they were God
They wanna create satellites and cameras everywhere
And make you think they got the all-seeing eye
Eh, I guess The Last Poets wasn't too far off
When they said that certain people got a god complex
I believe it's true
I don't get phased out by none of that, none of that
Helicopters, the TV screens, the newscasters, the satellite dishes
They just wishing
They can't really never do that
When they tell me to fear they law
When they tell me to try to have some fret in my heart behind the things that they do
This is what I think in my mind
And this is what I say to them
And this is what I'm saying to you check it

Ask them originals 'cause they know
Mos Def, Nate Dogg and Pharoahe
Step away from the mic, they too cold
The funk might fracture your nose
Say my name, say my name...
Observe how I stake my claim
I independently laid down and paved my game
My own two raise my flame, 'cause dickridin' ain't my thang!
I earned what they said I wouldn't
I got it the way they said I couldn't
But now, I'm gettin' it and they whole grill is crooked
Mad 'cause I'm gettin' caked out from my bookings
When y'all was askin' permission, I just stepped up and took it
What!? The kids better buy my rookie card now
'Cause after this year, the price ain't comin' down
And if you got a joint bubblin', then get money now
'Cause in a minute, there's gonna be some real trouble comin' out
Just a warnin' — as usual, some cats won't heed it
The hard-headed always gotta feel it to believe it
It's a shame they jealous gaze is too short to see it
But when they face hit the cement, they nod in agreement
We could play nice and decent, or dirty like the 7-1 Precinct
Call it a day, or make it a long evenin'
You keep on schemin', man, gimme some more reason
To have the women in your mama's church screamin' ""Lord Jesus!""
Harder than y'all 'cause I'm smarter than y'all
I know that deep down, it's gotta be botherin' y'all
Pay attention, watch Flaco get larger than y'all
Pour your pride on the rocks, and make you swallow it all
The mathematic problem for y'all, it just get harder to solve
Every day that the saga evolve
The do-or-die stay rumblin' and bubblin' hard
And when we move, we ain't got no discussion at all
East Coast's on your neck, and you ain't shruggin' it off

Maintain the same frame of mind — screw ya!
Get the picture, sit ya, seat ya, greet ya with scriptures

The dosage is leavin' you mentally unfocused here

He under thirty years old but already he's a pro
Designer trousers slung low cause his pockets stay swoll'
Could afford to get up and be anywhere he go
V.I.P. at the club, backstage at the show

Hottest whips on the road neck and wrists on froze (say word)
Checks with Os, o-o-o-o-ohs
Straight all across the globe, watch got three time-zones
Keep the digital phone up to his dome
Two assistants, two bank accounts, two homes
One problem; even with the Os on his check
The po-po stop him and show no respect
""Is there a problem officer?"" Damn straight, it's called race

And even if it's never said and lips stay sealed
They actions reveal how their hearts really feel
Like, late night I'm on a first class flight
The only brother in sight, the flight attendant catch fright
I sit down in my seat, 2C
She approach officially, talking about, ""Excuse me""
Her lips curl up into a tight space
Cause she don't believe that I'm in the right place
Showed her my boarding pass, and then she sort of gasped
All embarrassed, put an extra lime in my water glass (So sorry)
An hour later here she come by, walkin' past
""I hate to be a pest but my son would love your autograph""
Wow.. (I saw you roll your eyes, Mr. Nigga I love your albums!..)
They stay on nigga patrol on American roads
And when you travel abroad they got world nigga law
Some folks get on a plane, go where they please
But I go overseas and I get over-seized
London, Heathrow, me and my people
They think that illegal's a synonym for negro
Far away places, customs agents flagrant
They think that dark faces smuggle weight in they cases
Bags inspected, now we arrested
Attention directed to contents of our intestines
Urinalysis followed by X-rays
Interrogated and detained 'til damn near the next day
No evidence, no apology, and no regard
Even for the big American rap star
For us especially, us most especially
A Mr. Nigga VIP jail cell, just for me
(If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake)
Just got some shoe-polish, painted my face
They say they want you successful, but then they make it stressful
You start keeping pace, they start changing up the tempo
Now, who is cat riding out on the town (Ha ha)
State trooper wanna stop him in his ride, pat him down
Mr. Nigga, Nigga Nigga
He got the speakers in the trunk with the bass on crunk
Now, who is the cat with the hundred dollar bill (What, what say word)
They gotta send it to the lab to make sure the shit is real

And they been fucking with that nigga for the last five years
Is it fair, is it equal, is it just, is it right?
Do you do the same shit when the defendant face is white?

'Cause it's the B-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Best in the world and all USA
It's the B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
L-Y-N is the place where I stay
The B-to-the-R-the-O-the-O-K
Place where I rest is on my born day

Bust it!
Sometimes, I sit back and just reflect
Watch the world go by, and my thought connect
I think about the time past and the time to come
Reminisce on Bed-Stuy when I was spry and young
I used to try and come to the neighborhood function
Throw on my Izod, say a little somethin'
When I was just a youngin', before the days of thuggin'
How me and Charlie Chims, and yo, what?! I'm only buggin'
Fast forward — 9, now I gotta team my seed
I must proceed at God's speed to perform my deed
Livin' the now space and time, 'round the nine-to-five
For as long as I'm alive, pah, I gotta strive
I ain't sittin roadside, that ain't part of the plan
I'm out here for my fam', doin' all that I can
I love my city! Sweet and gritty, inland to outskirts
Nickname Bucktown 'cause we prone to outburst
Philosophy redefine us, touch mine? I touch back
Walk the streets like ya sweet, and get beat like drum tracks
Catch no shakes, over Jakes (Woop-Woop!), we bust back
Bring the marty to your face with no place to run back
I'm from the slums that created the bass that thump back
This ain't a game, clown, play ya James Brown and jump back
What you want, Jack? Young cats stash they jums at
Draw they guns back, momma screams where she sons at
Tryin' to hunt that, recurrin' dream of high stakes
The fourth largest, first hardest, Brooklyn is the place
Settled by the Dutch many years ago
Three million strong, and here we go!

Good morning, Vietnam!
(We live in Brooklyn, baby) (Wake up, wake up)
(We live in Brooklyn, baby) (Wake up, wake up)

Yo, sometimes, I sit back, reflect on the place that I live at
Unlike any place I ever been at
The home of big gats, deep-dish hammer rim caps
Have a mishap, push your wig back
Where you go to get the fresh trim at
Fulton and Jay got the Timb rack
Blue collars metro cardin' it
Thugs mobbin' it, form partnership, increase armament
Street pharmacists — deep consequence
When you seek sleek ornaments, you get caught
Rode the white horse and can't get off
Big dogs that trick off just get sent off
They shoebox stash is all they seeds gotta live off
It's real, yo, but still, yo, it's love here
And it's felt by anybody that come here
Outta-towner's take the train, plane and bus here
Must be somethin' that they really want here
One year as a resident, deeper sentiment
They shout out, ""Go Brooklyn!"" — they representin' it
Sittin' on they front stoop, sippin' Guinness's
Usin' native dialect in they sentences
From the tree-line blocks to the tenements
To the Mom and Pop local shop businesses
We travel all around the world in great distances
And ain't a place that I know that bear resemblance
That's why we call it 'The Planet'
Not a borough or a province, our style is uncommon
From Sumner to Tompkins to Lafayette Gardens
Wyckoff, Gowanus, in they army jacket linings
Yo, this goes out to my cats in Coney Isle
Friday night out in front The Himalaya, goin' wild
This goes out to Crown Heights and Smurv Village
The '90s, and all my yarda Trini Brownsvillers
Parkside tennis courts; 30's, 40's and the 50's
The cats out in Starrett City gettin' busy
To the Hook, to the East, to the Stuy
Bushwick and Canarsie
Farragut, Fort Greene and Marcy
My Flatbush posse, generals and armies
When it's time to form, just call me
And let this song be playin' loud and long, B
If you love Bucktown strongly
Raze it up!
Brooklyn — my habitat, the place where it happen at
Lives sway in the sharp balance of the battle axe
Irons is brandished at, thugs draw they hammer back
It's where you find the News Two crew cameras at
It's where my fam is at, the summertime jam is at
They play B.I.G. and get you open like a sandal back
Hotter than candle wax, hustlin', you can't relax
The crack babies tryin' to find where they mamas at
It's off the handle, black, with big police scandals that
Turn into action screenplays sold to Miramax
The type of place where they check your appearance at
And cats who know where all the hot 'Lo gear is at
The stompin' grounds where you find the pound smokers that
Be Blazin' John, that have your wave cap floatin' back
The doorstep where the dispossessed posted at
Dope fiends out on Franklin Ave. sellin' Zovirax
You big ballin'? Better keep your money folded back
'Cause once the young guns notice that, it's over, black!
""Brooklyn keep on takin' it!"" — worldwide we known for that!
Flossy cats get it snatched like the local tax
The place I sharpen up my baritone vocals at
Where one of the greatest MC's was a local cat!13Embed",https://images.genius.com/7bc42f805aa192cfd886ce8e3f8d6846.667x667x1.jpg

They say that goodness in life belongs to those who believe:
So, I believe. Yes

I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish the rhyme
I start to think and then I sink
Into the paper, like I was ink
When I'm writing, I'm trapped in between the lines
I escape, when I finish

My pop said he was in love when he made me
Thought about it for a second wasn't hard to see
I could hear he was sincere, wasn't game or promotion
The entire affair's probably charged with emotion
When love call your heart I guess you got to pursue
12-11-73, my life is testament
Praise the beneficent, element that breath
Devoid in the form that make love manifest
I spent my early years in Roosevelt Projects
It was a bright valley with some dark prospects
In '83, Vendy C was the host with the most
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
I listened to the Rap Attack and held the radio close
This is far before the days of high glamour and pose
Aiyo, power from the streetlight made the place dark
I know a few understand what I'm talking about
It was love for the thing that made me wanna stay out
It was love for the thing that made me stay in the house
Spending time, writing rhymes
Trying to find words that describe the vibe
That's inside the space
When you close your eyes and screw your face
Is this the pain of too much tenderness?
To make me nod my head in reverence?
Should I visit this place in remembrance?
Or build landmarks here as evidence?
Nighttime, spirit shook my temperament
To write rhymes that portray this sentiment
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
We live the now for the promise of the infinite
And we believe in the promise
(Love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love)
Yes, yes, y'all, and we don't stop because

Ears and eyes keep in good time with the rhythm

You're big number fatin', we ancient like the abacus

Sprouting leaves, givin' breeze to the we who believe
I M.C., which means I Must Cultivate the Earth
Straight back, straight facts, heartbeats and hard work
I be the ""Funky Drummer"" to soften the hard Earth
(Amin) Pray Allah keep my soul and heart clean
(Amin) Pray the same thing again for all my team
From Restoration to Fort Greene, and on out to Queens
Uptown To Boogie-down, yo, just look around
Shook up the world like Ali in 6-3 (right)
I'm reaching a height that you said cannot be
I'm bringing a light which you said we can't see
Saw the new day comin', it look just like me
Sun bursts through the clouds, my photo ID
I bring light to your day and raise your degree
The universal magnetic, you must respect it
From end to beginning; bright, true and living
Ever-changing but sustaining magnificent
Building the now for the promise of the infinite
Building the now for the promise of the infinite

(Watch it) Relax, pump the brakes
You're speeding, money
You'll smash your whole shit up (slow down)
Lights be changing fast on these streets, money, slow down
(Slow down) Sleeping on the wrong cats

Clear like a megaphone
Pretty nigga heart skipped the metronome
Rocked the Trump Tower to the terrordome
Poor house to pleasure domes
Soprano, alto, tenor to baritone
Mos Def; one of the illest that you ever known
Rock steady baby, you a stepping stone
Smash your foundation into pebbles
My words leave your nerves unsettled
You take it to the next level down
Looking like a circus clown
Cats like you can't even get a pound
Worldwide from the river to lakeside
My stage show stay live, make the sound man stage dive
I cut fat cats to eight lives with my eight ball lines
I'm home 'fore I'm done with all nine
Got you shook like a fault line
Come all shine and get tarnished
Brooklyn got your pay roll garnished
They form a huddle
Whisper like they want trouble
I melt the ice grills into rainwater puddles
Make the proud-hearted leave on the humble
Black steel in the hour
Assemble my skill form my power
My poems crush bones into powder
You mumble like a coward
I'm Mos Def, you need to speak louder
Superheroes
Get your power, your masks and capes snatched
Brooklyn take what you can't take back
I know a lot of cats hate that
All I can say black
There's a city full of walls you can post complaints at
All the doubters and believers adjust your receivers
""I feel it,"" you can taste it through the speakers
The three six oh-riginal sketch lyrics so visual
They rent my rhyme books at your nearest home video

Tell them cats they need to sit back and observe where they at

Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Stay on time like Omegas
Brooklyn patrol like interstaters
Take their license and their registration papers

My joint's so passionate
Make you peel out and mash your shit
Get wild cold crash your whip
Front chassis wrecked, but akh' you can't be too upset
Tow truck got my tape in the deck
I'm permanent like tattoos and birth marks
Third degree burn marks
Driving on tracks like Dale Earnhardt
Stay on the low like the herb spot
Put a big loss on your earn chart
Nice since the nurse signed my birth chart
Seldom seen but often heard, while your jams is barely heard
Just my name is a daily word
From avenues to streets, terraces and park places
Stair wells, jail cells, penthouse to basements
Arrangement basic, but still fans chase it
Y2K can't delete the true ancient
Apache war drum on the ranges
Skill level dangerous
Arrow head that killed all the cavemen
They cry John-Blazing, but step on the pavement
And get violated like a plaintiff
I ain't shit to play with
I give a Goddamn what your name is
Delete it and make it so it never get repeated
Believe it
Tell the feds, tell your girl, tell your mother
Conference call you wack crew and tell each other
That they just ain't holding me
I'm Mos Def, you hopefully
Mush on before you get bust on like a ovary
Tell them cats they need to ease back and observe where they at
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on
Put your joint on cruise
Try to rush you scuff your brake shoes, just cool and relax
Take a breath, take ten paces back
Brook-nahm Vietnam
The heat is on, no off-ramp or detour

Make these gassed up jokers observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
Make these gassed up clowns observe the speed law
'Cause they speedin', speedin', speedin', speedin', speedin'
Speedin', speedin', speedin', speedin', speedin'
Speedin', speedin', speedin', speedin', speedin'

Slow down, you better chill, money
Lights be changing fast on these streets dude
Gonna smash your whole shit up
You better cool out, money
It ain't like that out here
Look at these cats man, it's funny man
You prob'ly just got that car

Turn me up in the top a little bit, dawg
I want you to know, I want you to hear this one (The sun's shinin')
Loud and clear, bright and early
Listen!

I don't hate players, I don't love the game
I'm the shot clock way above the game
To be point blank witchu — motherfuck the game!
I got all this work on me, I ain't come for play
You can show the little shorties how you pump and fake
But dawg, not to Def, I'm not impressed
I'm not amused, I'm not confused, I'm not the dude
I'm grown man business, I am not in school
Put your hand down, youngin', this is not for you
On my J-O with beats by Kanye, yo
My name on the marquee, your name off the payroll
Style fresh like I'm still a day old
And it's been like that since the day 0

Cherokee Red that shoot the long arrow
Got mo' skill, mo' aim, and mo' ammo
You can get it all from a big or small barrel
Like, ""Hail Mary, full of grace...""
Niggas come in and shoot up the place, and make you pull up your face
The deck, I'ma pull out the ace
From the jungles of the Empire State, where it ain't no escape
247, 718, and that's like every night, every day
From the place that I settle and stay
To the States, I'm collectin' my pay
Blast off, then I'm back to the K
Hold it down so my family straight
Represent in a family way
Pro-ball, not for amateur play
Been raw since the amateur stage
Before the press had the cameras raised
(Let the sun shine)
Like a long time man of the way
You understandin' me straight? (Let the sunshine in)
Yes, yes, no doubt! Excellence
It's what it is, it's what it is, and that's what it is, you see?
(The sun's shinin')
Ha! Fire!!

'Cause it is deeper, sweeter, richer, crisper
Stronger reception and sharper picture
Revolve around God, and involve with niggas
These elements help evolve my scripture
And make Mos Def a classic modern figure
Brooklyn — it don't matter if ya holler or whisper
You comin' through clear, 'cause I'm right here witcha
Ain't gotta edit your slang — I got it, I get ya

The lovers, the leavers, the doubters, believers
The stayers, the quitters, the bitches, the niggas
Rebel guerrillas to ghetto civilians
Y'all gon' feel it from the first to the millionth
It's extra, ordinary and plain
I walked a thousand paces of life ahead of the game
By the time that you get where I'm standin', I'll be gone
Y'all make moves, but y'all just move wrong
(Let the sun shine)
I move in, and y'all must move on, 'cause I'm molto strong
And I know what my feet move for (Let the sunshine in)
Make it go without a brand new car
I was fresh without a brand new song
Don't give a fuck about what brand you are (The sun's shinin')
I'm concerned what type of man you are
What your principles and standards are
You understand me, y'all?
Be good to your family, y'all
No matter where your families are
'Cause everybody need family, y'all
Raise a hand if you understand me, y'all
Everybody need family, y'all
Be good to your families, dawg
Understand, no matter where your families are
Everybody need family, dawg
Raise your hand, you understand me, pah

New World Water make the tide rise high
Come inland and make your house go ""Bye"" (My house!)
Fools done upset the Old Man River
Made him carry slave ships and fed him dead niggas
Now his belly full and he about to flood somethin'
So I'm throwin' rope that ain't tied to nothin'
Tell your crew use the H2 in wise amounts since
The New World Water; and every drop counts
You can laugh and take it as a joke if you wanna
But it don't rain a full week some summers
And it's about to get real wild in the half
You be buying Evian just to take a fuckin bath
Heads is acting wild, sippin' poor, puffin' dank
Competin' with the next man for higher playin' rank
See I ain't got time tryin' to be Big Hank
Fuck a bank; I need a twenty-year water tank
Cause while these knuckleheads is out here sweatin' they goods
The sun is sitting in the treetops, burnin' the woods
And as the flames from the blaze get higher and higher

I am, yes I am, the descendant (yes yes)
Of those folks whose backs got broke
Who fell down inside the gun smoke
(Black people!) Chains on their ankles and feet
I am descendants of the builders of your street
(Black people!) Tenders to your cotton money
I am hip-hop
""It's heavy metal for the black people""
I am rock and roll (rock and roll, rock'n'roll)
Been here forever
They just ain't let you know (HA!)
I said, Elvis Presley ain't got no soul (huh)
Chuck Berry is rock and roll (damn right)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't come up with that style on they own (uh-uh)
Elvis Presley ain't got no soul (hell naw)
Little Richard is rock and roll (damn right)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't come up with that shit on they own (nah-ah)
You might also likeGuess that's just the way shit goes
You steal my clothes and try to say they yours (yes they do)
Cause it's a show filled with pimps and hoes
Trying to take everything that you made or control (there they go)
Elvis Presley ain't got no soul
Bo Diddley is rock and roll (damn right)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they ain't the first place the credit belongs
Say whoa-oh (don't take it)
Oh-we-oh (black music)
Whoa-oh (don't take it)
Oh-we-oh (black music)
Whoa-oh (Jimi Hendrix say)
Oh-we-oh (black music)
Whoa-oh (Albert King and)
Oh-we-oh (and Motown)
I ain't trying to diss
But I don't be trying to fuck with Limp Bizkit (""The fuck is on your mind?"")
When I get down in my zone
I be rockin Bad Brains and Fishbone
I ain't tryin to slow your groove
But that ain't the way I'm trying to move
I don't turn on Korn to get it on;
I be playing Jimi Hendrix 'til the dawn
That's my word is bond
Sitting up on my front lawn
Got the volume turned to ten
Playing Albert King the best again (black)
When the morning in the cooker
Got to turn on some John Lee Hooker
When I want some rock and roll
Go to Otis Redding to get some soul
Say, James Brown got plenty of soul
James Brown like to rock and roll
He can do all the shit fo' sho'
That Elvis Presley could never know (black people)
Said, Kenny G ain't got no soul
John Coltrane is rock and roll (uh-huh)
You may dig on the Rolling Stones
But they could never ever rock like Nina Simone

And give the flavor to niggas but keep it low on sodium

Spent time hating it but that ain't changing it
God give it to me, nobody is takin' it
Therefore, moving on the base for stimulus
I'm standing in the twilight and watching them get it in
The walls are tremblin', the air is simmering
She movin' like more than her ears are listenin', whoa now
Testin' your equilibrium
Sonic wave booming all over your intimate
Skin on skin and skin on skin again
Put it all, get it all, get on, get it in

Fuck the empire
High flying like the Millenium Falcon piloted by Han Solo
I never roll for dolo, fronting on me's a no-no
Understand, doing this for my family
Ha ha, check it out y'all

Yo, I'm trying to make a dollar out of what makes sense
Add it up, told my daddy I'd be a rich man
You never know when your fate gon' switch hand
Get today's solid ground out of yesterday's quicksand
I was a young boy who dreamt about being a big man
On small looseleaf sheets, I sketched a big plan
Gotta handle business properly, boost up my economy
Store it up and get my mom some waterfront property
Yesterday was not for me but nowaday it's time for me
The streets is watching me, I watch back, that's the policy
Moving along my odyssey like blood through the artery
Navigate the treacherous and make it seem effortless
Let those who make the exodus seekin' the North beacon
From beating and hog-eating, from punishment all season
From hands cracked and bleeding, cotton thorns in your palms
It's for y'all that I sketch these songs, and it goes
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow
I fear no man, because faith is the arrow
My vocal chord travel worldwide to block narrow
We can blow with the ammo or go mano-a-mano
Kweli is you with me (What up, what up)
Let's make it happen
I burn through your argument with action
My eyes stay fastened to tomorrow, looking for a brighter day
When y'all wanna leave y'all
Right away

I give it up to God, all that love and attachment get
Scary well-prepared with the shears when it get hairy
Like how these niggas is looking like some fairies
And singing like canaries to the beast
And anybody who will listen to 'em clearly
Y'all don't hear me though, even when I'm coming through in stereo
You make a mockery of what I represent properly
Yo, why you starting me
I take that shit straight to the artery
Intellectual property I got the title and the deed
I pay for rent with the tears and sweat and what I bleed
MCs imitate the way we walk, the way we talk
You cats spit lyrical pork with no spiritual thought
Plus your flow a little bit off
You come across soft
Back in the days niggas like that on stage got tossed off
Need to get crossed off the guestlist
It's like you gotta be disrespected and thrown out the exit
To get the message
Sometimes your sunshine get snatched like a necklace
When you get too drunk on power and your drive get reckless
Check it, MCs in my face after I slug you then I hug you
If I gotta dead you know it's only 'cause I love you

To the elders (in the coffins)
Living native (dying for it) understand

Yea, yea, we got love in the place
Shout out from up top (to the middle)
To black bottom (sky high!)

Kweli say, ""Everybody act according to the season that they born in""
Some in the night, some in the morning, some at noon
Some in winter, some in June
It's all cool, it's the natural
Science is a jewel
For me and mines, yours and you
Let's move, tell you a little bit about mine, yo

I was born in a season where the world was quiet and cold
Celebrations were going on
Some were happy, some were sad
Some felt bad from being good
Some felt good from being bad, feelings pass and change
But they never leave, they here to stay
Holiday, holiday, happy birthday
Teenage love, the first cut run deep
Soul on flesh, this is the Brooklyn streets
Year of the Ox, seven and three
M.D., the history (come on)
Every soul got one of these (yes)
It's where you been and where you be
And without understanding you cannot proceed
Complete, the start and the end
Then it just go round again

Again and again, brand new
Again and again, so fresh
Again and again, newness

I was born in the decade of decadence where they worshipped what they have
Ford was president, do the math
The war was ended when the North Vietnamese stormed the city of Saigon
We was like, bye, we was gone, let bygones be bygones
I'm gone, spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
Where they hug you with the firearm, try it on
Like new school clothes, Black Star official
Smash when we do a show, it's facts, no mystery
I'm down with the crew like Mussolini in Italy
I rock with the Roots like the Giving Tree
Powerful, bigotry at work, me and my people got history
These rappers dumb it down considerably
We get it poppin' like a hit chorus
The flow is historic, they can't get rid of us
Ubiquitous, and we lay the law like Leviticus
Ten years ago we made history so they missing us

And don't call it a comeback in particular
Even if it blend into ephemera or
Fade into peripheral, transmission of the ministers' origin
Over broadcast clear without diminishing
Black Star stovetop burning soul temperatures, administers
Alkalines, aminos and minerals: essentials
Served over Dilla time signatures
It's miracle material, remember it's right now foreverness3Embed",https://images.genius.com/7bc42f805aa192cfd886ce8e3f8d6846.667x667x1.jpg

I just wanna chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 7-45
You drive me crazy, shorty, I
Need to see you and feel you next to me
I provide everything you need, and I
Like your smile, I don't want to see you cry
Got some questions that I got to ask
And I hope you can come up with the answers, babe

Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
Girl, it's easy to love me now
Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?

If I fell off tomorrow, would you still love me?
If I didn't smell so good, would you still hug me?
If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?
If I went back to a hooptie from a Benz
Would you poof and disappear like some of my friends?
If I was hit and I was hurt, would you be by my side?
If it was time to put in work, would you be down to ride?
I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive
I'm askin' questions to find out how you feel inside
If I ain't rap 'cause I flip burgers at Burger King
Would you be ashamed to tell your friends you're feelin' me?
In the bed, if I used my tongue, would you like that?
If I wrote you a love letter, would you write back?
Now, we could have a little drink, you know, a nightcap
And we could go do what you like, I know you like that (Like that)

Are you my soulmate? ‘Cause if so, girl, you a blessing
Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?
I'm starin' at you, tryna figure how you got in them jeans
If I was down, would you say things to make me smile?
I'll treat you how you want to be treated, just teach me how
If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me, or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

And niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)
I put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me
My back on the wall, now you gon' see
Better watch how you talk when you talk about me
'Cause I'll come and take your life away

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me

Now man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head
Go on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead
I'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found
I'm the underground king and I ain't been crowned
When I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time
I'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime
I walk the block with the bundles, I've been knocked on the humble
Swing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do
Got a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head
Turn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs
I walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder
'Til I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Sunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain
Joy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain
Death gotta be easy, 'cause life is hard
It'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred
This is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars
For the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars
I don't say ""only God can judge me,"" 'cause I see things clear
Crooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years
I'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don
Like Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm
Slim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me
I thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie? (Homie)

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Every night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back
I know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat
In my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me
Psychic says some bitch done put a hex on me
The feds didn't know much when Pac got shot
I got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked
I ain't gon' spell it out for you motherfuckers all the time
Are you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?
In the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around
Hommo shot me, three weeks later he got shot down
Now it's clear that I'm here for a real reason
'Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'

Many men
Many, many, many, many men
Wish death 'pon me
Lord, I don't cry no more
Don't look to the sky no more
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on my soul
Somewhere my heart turned cold
Have mercy on many men

I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see
That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, shawty)

Now, shawty, she in the club, she dancin' for dollars
She got a thing for that Gucci, that Fendi, that Prada
That BCBG, Burberry, Dolce & Gabbana
She feed them foolish fantasies, they pay her 'cause they want her
I spit a little G, man, and my game got her
An hour later, have that ass up in the Ramada
Them trick niggas in her ear sayin' they think about her
I got the bitch by the bar, tryna get a drink up out her
She like my style, she like my smile, she like the way I talk
She from the country, think she like me 'cause I'm from New York
I ain't that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some head
I'm that nigga tryna holler 'cause I want some bread
I could care less how she perform when she in the bed
Bitch, hit that track, catch a date, and come and pay the kid
Look, baby, this is simple, you can't see
You fuckin' with me, you fuckin' with a P-I-M-P

That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P

I'm 'bout my money, you see, girl, you can holler at me
If you fuckin' with me, I'm a P-I-M-P
Not what you see on TV, no Cadillac, no greasy
Head full of hair, bitch, I'm a P-I-M-P
Come get money with me if you curious to see
How it feels to be with a P-I-M-P
Roll in the Benz with me, you could watch some TV
From the backseat of my V, I'm a P-I-M-P

Girl, we could pop some champagne and we could have a ball
We could toast to the good life, girl, we could have it all
We could really splurge, girl, and tear up the mall
If ever you needed someone, I'm the one you should call
I'll be there to pick you up if ever you should fall
If you got problems, I can solve 'em, they big or they small
That other nigga you be with ain't 'bout shit
I'm your friend, your father, and confidant, bitch
I don't know what you heard about me
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see

That I'm a motherfuckin' P-I-M-P (Now, shawty)

I told you fools before, I stay with the tools
I keep a Benz, some rims, and some jewels
I holler at a ho 'til I got a bitch confused
She got on Payless, me? I got on gator shoes
I'm shoppin' for chinchillas, in the summer they cheaper
Man, this ho, you can have her when I'm done, I ain't gon' keep her
Man, bitches come and go, every nigga pimpin' know
This ain't no secret, you ain't gotta keep it on the low
Bitch, choose on me, I'll have you strippin' in the street
Put my other hoes down, you get your ass beat
Now Niki my bottom bitch, she always come up with my bread
The last nigga she was with put stitches in her head
Get your ho out of pocket, I'll put a charge on a bitch
'Cause I need four TVs and AMGs for the six
Ho, make a pimp rich, I ain't payin', bitch
Catch a date, suck a dick, shit (Trick)
I don't know what you heard about me (Yeah)
But a bitch can't get a dollar out of me (Woo)
No Cadillac, no perms, you can't see (Uh-huh)

In Hollywood they say, ""There's no business like show business""

Hey Em, you know you my favorite white boy, right? (Hahaha)
I owe you for this one

I been patiently waitin' for a track to explode on (Yeah)
You can stunt if you want and your ass'll get rolled on (It's 50)
And it feels like my flow's been hot for so long (Yeah)
If you thinkin' I'ma fuckin' fall off, you're so wrong (It's 50)

I'm innocent in my head, like a baby born dead
Destination heaven, sit and politic with passengers from 9/11 (Yeah)
The Lord's blessings leave me lyrically inclined (Uh-huh)
Shit, I ain't even got to try to shine (Woo)
God's the seamstress that tailor-fitted my pain
I got scriptures in my brain, I could spit at your dame
Straight out the good book, look, niggas is shook
50 fear no man, warrior, swing swords like Conan
Picture me, pen in hand, writin' lines knowin' The Source'll quote it
When I die, they'll read this and say a genius wrote it
I grew up without my pops, should that make me bitter?
I caught cases, I copped out, does that make me a quitter?
In this white man's world, I'm similar to a squirrel
Lookin' for a slut with a nice butt to get a nut
If I get shot today, my phone'll stop ringin' again

Debatin' whether or not you can even weather the storm
And as you lay on the table, they operatin' to save you
It's like an angel came to you, sent from the heavens above
They think they're crazy, but they ain't crazy, let's face it, shit, basically
They're just playin' sick, they ain't shit, they ain't sayin' shit, spray 'em, 50
A to the K, get in the way, I'll bring Dre and them with me
And turn this day into fuckin' mayhem, you stayin' with me?
Don't let me lose you, I'm not tryna confuse you
When I let loose with this Uzi and just shoot through your Isuzu
You get the message? Am I gettin' through to you?
You know what's comin'? You motherfuckers don't even know, do you?
Take some Big and some Pac and you mix 'em up in a pot
Sprinkle a little Big L on top, what the fuck do you got?
You got the realest and illest killers tied up in a knot
The juggernauts of this rap shit, like it or not
It's like a fight to the top just to see who'd die for the spot
You put your life in this, nothin' like survivin' a shot
Y'all know what time it is, soon as 50 signs on this dot
Shit, what you know about death threats? 'Cause I get a lot
Shady Records was eighty seconds away from the towers
Some cowards fucked with the wrong building, they meant to hit ours
Better evacuate all children (Woo), it's nuclear showers
There's nothin' spookier, you're now about to witness the power of fuckin' 50

If the gun squad hearin' all the shots go off
It's 50, they say it's 50
See a nigga laid out with his fuckin' top blown off
It's 50, man, that wasn't 50, don't holla my name

You know you shouldn't throw stones if you live in a glass house (Yeah)
And if you got a glass jaw, you should watch your mouth
'Cause I'll break your face (Uh-huh)
Have your ass runnin', mumblin' to the jake
You goin' against me, dawg, you're makin' a mistake
I'll split ya, leave you lookin' like the Michael Jackson jackets with all them zippers
I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me skipper (Uh-huh)
The way I turn the money over, you should call me flipper (Flipper)
Your bitch a regular bitch, you callin' her wifey
I fucked and feed her fast food, you keepin' her icy
I'm down to sell records, but not my soul
Snoop said this in '94, ""We don't love them hoes""
I got pennies for my thoughts, now I'm rich
See the twenties spinnin' lookin' mean on the 6
Niggas wearin' flags 'cause the colors match they clothes
They get caught in the wrong hood and filled up with holes, motherfucker

My, yeah, yeah, mmm
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go
No place to go
All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go
Nowhere to run and hide
No matter how hard I try, yeah

Yeah, '03, I went from quite filthy to filthy rich
Man, their emotions change, so I can never trust a bitch
I tried to help niggas get on, they turned around and spit
Right in my face, so Game and Buck both can suck a dick
Now when you hear 'em it may sound like it's some other shit
‘Cause I'm not writin' anymore, they not makin' hits
I'm far from perfect, there's so many lessons I done learned
If money's evil, look at all the evil I done earned
I'm doin' what I'm supposed to
I'm a writer, I'm a fighter, entrepreneur
Fresh out the sewer, watch me maneuver—what's it to ya?
The track I lace it, it's better than basic
This is my recovery, my comeback, kid

While you were sippin' your own Kool-Aid gettin' your buzz heavy
I was in the fuckin' shed, sharpenin' my machete
Sippin' on some of that revenge juice, gettin' my taste buds ready
To wolf down this spaghetti or should I say this spa-get-even?
I think you fuckin' meatballs keep on just forgettin'
Thought he was finished, motherfucker, it's only the beginnin'
He's buggin' again, he's straight thuggin', fuck who he's offendin'! (Yeah!)
He'll rip your vocal chords out and have them bitches plugged in the
Motherfuckin' wall with 3000 volts of electricity
Now take the other end of 'em, then plug them motherfuckers-in-each
One of your eye sockets 'cause I thought you might finally fuckin' see
That'll teach you to go voicin' your cocksuckin' opinion to me
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, fuck lettin'
Up! You’re gonna end up regrettin' you ever betted against me
Feels like I'ma snap any minute
Yeah, it's happenin' again
And I'm thinkin' about just sayin', ""Motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch but 50!""
‘Cause this is all I know
This is why so hard I go
I swear to God I put my heart and soul
In this more than anybody knows
I'm trapped, so all I do is rap
But every time I rap I'm more trapped
And I rap myself right to this bubble
Oh I guess it's bubble wrap (Haha)
It's like a vicious cycle, my life's in a crisis
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn up like it did?
Feels like I'm goin' psycho again (Ch, ch, ch, ch)
And I might just blow my lid
Shit, I almost wish that I would have never made Recovery, kid
‘Cause I'm runnin' in circles with—
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away
There's no place to go

All the confusion
It's an illusion, like a movie
Got nowhere to go

I haven't been this fuckin' confused since I was a kid
Sold like 40 million records, people forgot what I did
Maybe this is for me, maybe
Maybe I'm supposed to go crazy
Maybe I'll do it 3 a.m. in the morning like Shady
Psycho killer, Michael Myers
I'm on fire like a lighter
Try to say this ain't classic, get yo' ass kicked mad quick
Wrap your head up in plastic
Pussy, now pick the casket
Dirt nap with the maggots, it's tragic
It's sad, it's never gonna end
Now we number one again
With that frown on your face and your heart full of hate
Accept it, respect it, this a gift God-given
Like the air in the lungs of every fuckin' thing livin'
My life, my life
Makes me wanna run away

I kiss like the french do, I put my tongue in your ear
Do it like the dogs do it girl and pull on your hair
For me a different scenery just mean a different position
In the tub or on the sink I improvise now listen
In the chopper or on the jet, join the mile high club
I'm no fool I know money can't buy me love
But I'm a different type of nigga that make sure that you know
Instead of a rose, there's a hundred dozen of those
See I see somethin special when I look in your eyes
With your legs way back I see this pussy is mine
If you ain't sure when I'm talkin I don't tell you no lies
But there's things that you say that have me wonderin why
When I don't say what I'm thinkin it don't mean that I'm shy
Got on that shit you picked out for me that's why I'm so fly

If I was your best friend, I want you 'round all the time

Please say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend
While you in your bubble bath I'll come wash on your back
When you puttin on your lotion I can help you with that
I sit and think of things to say that may make you smile
Or give you gifts from my heart to reflect my style
Or slang I use when we build may change how you talk
And if I'm focused while I'm strokin I could change how you walk
That's the swagger you come with when you come from New York
I'm a hustler I just hustle in the things that I bought
Separate me from the rest, I feel like I'm the best
If there's a price to pay for feelin you I pay that twice
I'm as ghetto as it gets girl you know that's right
I ain't got nothin to hide baby I tell you my secrets
'Fore you end up bein 'round long enough to peep shit
I get closer to you, I mean closer than close
I get into you, after I take off my clothes
Girl I been into you, mentally long before

Everything new
Spikes on the Louboutins (boutins, boutins)

I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
I'm used to the bullshit, it don't matter boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So what you want, the cheese or the cheeks?
You want the cheeks but she want the cheese, a bitch gotta eat
I'm havin' the epiphany, you niggas ain't shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I'm from
I'm a Southside nigga, yeah, I'm 'bout mine
You be that next nigga coroners come outline
You ain't made of what I'm made of

Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh, Southside
Now what y'all niggas know about the dirty South?
One time

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again (And again and again)
Yo, when you hear talk of the Southside, you hear talk of the Team
See niggas feared Prince and respected 'Preme
For all you slow motherfuckers, I'ma break it down iller
See Preme was the business man and Prince was the killer
Remember, he used to push the bulletproof BM, uh-huh
His hair'll get you seasick, I sat back and peeped shit
They rolled with E-Z Wider then, they ain't get blunted
Had the whole projects working for 50 on 500
As a youth, all I ever did was sell crack, I used to idolize Cat
Hurt me to my heart to hear that nigga snitched on Pap
How he go out like that?
Rumors in the hood was Gus was snitching
I ain't believe that, pa, he helped me cop my first GSXR
Had the 4-runner, the Z, the 5 and the 3
Used to drive his truck through the hood dragging jet skis
From Gerald Wallace to Baby Wise, don't be surprised
Of how freely I throw out names of guys who dealt with pies
Like L.A. and Wise, L got shot in the neck, then told his connect
Them niggas who shot them got 'em for ten bricks
Fucking Dominicans, turned around and gave 'em more bricks
You might also like
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again (And again and again)

That first verse is just a dose of the shit that I'm on
Consider this the first chapter in the ghetto's Qu'ran
I know a lot of niggas that get dough like Bimmy and Joe
And Prince and Righteous from Hillside with the mole on his nose
Throughout my struggles in the hood, I started learning
Life's a bitch with a pretty face, but she burning
Man, I'ma get cheese like Chaz then run through whips like Cigar
Gamble all the time like country-curly head Prince and Tah-Tah
Po-po under pressure too, they know what they facing
Go against crews like Bebo and killers like Pappy Mason
A lot of niggas I know been corrupted since birth
Types to rob nuns for fun, for everything they worth
I know some cats that held down whole complexes like Corley Wall
Together niggas stand and divided they fall
Round here, shook niggas they keep it in motion
Come around here with your Rollie, you can get robbed like Ocean
Lord knows, Tommy had Laurelton sold
Helicopters, Rolls Royces with Louis Vuitton interior
Might sound like I'm fantasizing, but, son, I'm dead serious
Montana was no dummy, brought business to wash the money
Had money out the ass, he politic like the Asians
Feds couldn't catch him dirty so settled for tax evasion
Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again (And again and again)

Yo, rest in peace to Rich and Ron, money what they was about, yo
The twins was from Queens but got crazy cream with Alpo
Throughout my time, I heard tales of Himey, Frenchy
Jamaican Pauly, Duckie Corley, Ronnie Bumps and Chick, shit
A lot of niggas flow the way I flow
But ain't been in the game all their life so don't know who I know
Writing rhymes is the best way I express how I feel
If I ain't rich by twenty-six, I'll be dead or in jail
Coming up, I heard sipping too much booze'll leave you confused
And if you watch the news, you see players in this game, they lose
I'm forgetting Lefty and Jazz, Pretty Tony and Lance
Head Luc, Mel son, Troy and E Money Bags
In a conversation over shrimp and lobster at Benihana's
Heard Chico stopped boxing, and started robbing diners
Shout out to Clarence and Clutch, Bob Dre, Black Will
If the flow don't kill you, the MAC will

Lord forgive me, for I've sinned
Over and over again just to stay on top
I recall memories, filled with sin
Over and over again, and again (And again and again)19Embed",https://images.genius.com/10f98dca7bcd1a31222e36374544cad5.1000x1000x1.png

They say this is a big, rich town
I just come from the poorest part
Bright lights, city life, I gotta make it
This is where it goes down
I just happen to come up hard
Legal or illegal, baby, I gotta make it

I never took a straight path nowhere, life's full of twist and turns
Bumps and bruises, I live, I learn
I'm from that city full of yellow cabs and skyscrapers
It's hard to get a start in these parts without paper
Homie, I grew up in hell, a block away from heaven
That corner every 15 minutes they moving seven
Pure snow, bag it then watch it go
Occupational options, get some blow or some hoes
Shoot the ball or the strap, learn to rap or to jack
Fuck it, man, in the mean time go ahead and pump a pack
This my regal royal flow, my James Bond bounce
That 007, that 62 on my count
I'm a undercover liar, I lie under the covers
Look a bitch in the eyes and tell her ''baby, I love it''
You're my inspiration, you're my motivation
You're the reason that I'm moving it with no hesitation

Manuever around the rats and wolves, I'm from the school

Graveyard, pick a block cause niggas want your spots
I'm trying to stack shit then I go legit
Hollow tip, stuff 'em in a clip case niggas trip
My cocaine endeavours give me corporate ties
I'm supposed to lose, watch me win against the odds
All I got is my word, balls and my instinct
I'm trying to make it, we already made it my friends think
We already on top, I got a bigger plan
No more controlled substances or hand to hand
White collar visions, game changing mission
Big risks, big wins, equal bigger living
Perfect position, watch me transition
From caterpillar to butterfly in the sky

I won't burn unless you're there, you're there
Oooh I need you

America got a thing for this gangster shit, they love me
Black Chukkas, black skully, leather Pelle Pelle
I tag SPIT over Ramo's shit, I'm a vandal
Got that silver duct tape on my trey-eight handle
The women in my life bring confusion and shit
So like Nino in ""New Jack,"" I holla ""Cancel that bitch!""
Look at me, this is the life I chose
Niggas around me so cold, man my heart done froze
I built an empire on the low, the NARC's don't know
I'm the weatherman, I take that cocoa leaf and make that snow
Sit back, watch it turn to dope, watch it go out the do'
O after O, you know?
Homie, I'm just triple beam, dreaming, niggas be scheming
I fiend to live the good life, the fiends are just fiendin'
Conceal my weapon nice and neat so you can't see

Yeah, I don't know shit about gymnastics, I somersault bricks
And black talons start flying when a nigga flip
I cook crack in the microwave, niggas can't fuck with me
Man my co-d's call me Chef Boyar-50
Check my logic, smokers don't like seeds in they weed, shit
Send me them seeds, I'll grow them what they need
Them ain't Chia pet plants in the crib, that's chronic
And I'm selling them for 500 a pop, goddamn it
I sell anything I'm a hustler, I know how to grind
Step on grapes, put it in water and tell you it's wine
If you analyze me, what you will find
Is the DNA of a crook and what goes on in my mind
Is contagious, hypnotic, it sounds melodic
If rap was the block or a spot, I'd be that potent product
Now get a load of me, flashy, far from low key
And you can locate me wherever that dope be
Getting money man
I want the finer things in my life
So I hustle (Hustle)

So I hustle (Hustle)

It's the Hustler's Ambition, close your eyes, listen see my vision
Mossberg pumpin', shotgun dumpin'
The drama means nothing, it's part of the game
Catch me in the coupé switching lanes or in the jeweler switching chains
I upgrade from dirty ""BS"" to clean VS
Rocks that I copped from proceeds from the spot
I got the energy to win, I'm full of adrenaline
Play the curb and get nauseous, watching the spinners spin
I made plans to make it, a prisoner of the state
Now I can invite your ass out to my estate
Them hollow tips bent me up, but I'm back in shape
Pour Cristal in the blender, make a protein shake
I'm like the East coast number one playboy B
Hugh Hefner'll tell you he ain't got shit on me
The feds watch me, icey, they can't stop me

Your success is not enough, you wanna be hard (Yeah)
Knowing that if you get knocked, you get fucked in the yard (Ah)
You's a Pop Tart, sweetheart, you soft in the middle (Haha)
I eat you for breakfast, the watch was an exchange for your necklace
And your boss is a bitch, if he could he would
Sell his soul for cheap, trade his life to be Suge
You can buy cars, but can't buy respect in the hood
Maybe I'm so disrespectful 'cause to me you're a mystery
I know niggas from your hood, you have no history (Uh-huh)
Never poked nothing, never popped nothing, nigga stop fronting
Jay put you on, X made you hot
Now you run around like you some big shot, haha (Haha), pussy

It's easy to see when you look at me
If you look closely, 50 don't back down
Everywhere I go, both coasts with toast
East side, west side, I hold that MAC down
Every little nigga you see around me
Hold a gun big enough to fucking hold Shaq down
Next time you in the hood and see a OG
You ask about me, the young boy don't back down

""The rap game is all fucked up now, what are we gonna do now?
How we gonna eat man? 50 back around""
That's Ja little punk ass thinking out loud
South side 'til I die, that's just how I get down
I'm back in the game, shawty, to rule and conquer
You sing for hoes and sound like the Cookie Monster
I'm the hardest from New York, my flow is bonkers
All the other hard niggas, they come from Yonkers
It's been years and you had the same niggas in the background
You're never gonna sell Mitsubishi Tah or Crack Child
Them niggas there just suck, they no good
I ain't never heard a nigga say they like them in the hood
I'm back, better than ever, on top of my game
Even them country boys saying, ""50 we feeling you, mane""
Now y'all stay the fuck outta my zone, outta my throne
I'm New York City's own bad guy (Bad guy)
It's easy to see when you look at me

I've been patiently waiting to blow
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to ""The 50 Cent Show""
This is my life, my pain, my knife, my gun
Now that I'm back, you can't sleep, I'm a nightmare, huh?
You hired cops to hold you down 'cause you fear for your life
But you done heard about them guns I done bought, right?
I ain't going nowhere, I done told you, nigga
I'm a G-Unit motherfuckin' soldier, nigga (They not gon' like you)
I know, I know, haha (G-Unit)

Oh no, he didn't say anything about Ja, okay?
Ja is my boo, okay? Jeffrey Atkins ain't never hurt nobody
And y'all know big thangs come in small packages, holla
Now everythang was cool until 50 Cent came back into the picture
They better not put they hands on Jeffrey, okay?
'Cause first of all, they do not know that I am a twelve degree pink belt, okay?
I will dice his ass up like a little piece of celery, okay?
'Cause, see, they don't know me, Delicious
Do they know me? Okay, I thought so
'Cause you know I know karate, and I will see him

Ayy, you want some of this shit?
Nah, I don't want that shit
I don't give a fuck
I don't play that shit, and I'm finna buss a cap in a nigga
Man, shut the fuck up!
Slow down, slow down, slow down
You see that brick house right there? That's the nigga crib
When he come out you gotta tighten his ass up
I'ma get in the other car
Aight

If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin'
To me, I'll ride by and blow your brains out (Brains out)
There's no time to cock it, no way you can stop it
When niggas run up on you with them thangs out (Thangs out)
I do what I gotta do, I don't care I if get caught
The DA can play this motherfuckin' tape in court
I'll kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm sayin', homie, I ain't playin'
Catch you slippin', I'ma kill you, I ain't playin'
Hear what I'm saying, homie, I ain't playin'

Keep thinking I'm candy 'til your fucking skull get popped
And your brain hop out the top like Jack-in-the-box (Yeah)
In the hood, summertime is the killing season
It's hot out this bitch, that's a good enough reason (Woo)
I've seen gangstas get religious when they start bleeding
Saying ""Lord, Jesus help me"" 'cause they ass leaking
When that window roll down and that AK come out
You can squeeze your little handgun 'til you run out
And you can run for your backup
But them machine gun shells gon' tear your back up
God's on your side? Shit, I'm aight with that
'Cause we gon' reload them clips and come right back
It's a fact, homie, you go against me, you're fucked
I get the drop, if you can duck, you're luckier than Lady Luck
Look, nigga, don't think you safe 'cause you moved out the hood
'Cause your mama still around, dawg, and that ain't good
If you was smart, you'd be shook of me
'Cause I'll get tired of looking for you, spray your mama crib and let your ass look for me

My heart bleeds for you, nigga, I can't wait to get to you
Behind that twinkle in your eyes, I can see the bitch in you
Nigga, you know the streets talk
So there'll be no white flags and no peace talks
I got my back against the wind, I'm down to ride 'til the sun burn out
If I die today I'm happy how my life turned out
See the shootouts, I done been in 'em by myself
Locked up, I was in a box by myself
I done made myself a millionaire by myself
Now shit changed, motherfucker, I can hire some help
I done heard about the fifty grand you put in the hood
But your shooter finna get shot, it won't do him no good
With a pistol, I define the definition of pain
If you survive, your bones'll still fucking hurt when it rains
Oh, you a pro at playing Battleship? Well, this ain't the same
Little homie, this is a whole different type of war game
See, the losers end up in shackles and motherfucking chains
Or laid out in the street, leaking out they brains
If there's beef, cock it and dump it, the drama really means nothin'
To me, I'll ride by and blow your brains out (Brains out)

After the fist fights it's gunfire, boy, you get the best of me (Best of me)
If you don't wanna get shot, I suggest you don't go testing me (Testing me)
All the wrong I've done, the Lord still keep on blessing me (Blessing me)

When you make it go 'round and 'round

I step up in the club, I'm like, ""Who you with?""

Yeah, I'm young, but a nigga from the old school
On the dancefloor a nigga doin' old moves
I don't give a fuck, I do what I wan' do
I hit your ass up, boy, I done warned you
Better listen when I talk, nigga, don't trip

Keep the dancefloor packed, that's without a doubt
But shawty shake that thang like a pro, man
She backed it up on me I'm like ""Oh, man""

Nah, that's a semi-auto and a vest on my chest
I try not to say nothin' the DA might wanna play in court
But I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport
Front on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you
You gettin' money, I can't get none with ya, then fuck ya
I'm not the type to get knocked for DWI
I'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise
Gangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me
I grew up around some niggas that's not my homies
Hundred Gs, I stash it (What?), the MAC, I blast it (Yeah)
Ds come, we dump the diesel in battery acid

Every chick I fuck with is a dime

Where I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone
Cross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya

I'm— trust me, I'm— trust me, I'm trying to help
I'm— trust me, I'm— trust me, I'm trying to help

Flash that buttery gold
Jittery zeitgeist, wither by the watering hole, what a patrol
What are we to Heart Huckabee, art fuckery suddenly
Not enough young in his lung for the water wings
Colorfully vulgar poacher, out of mulch
Like, ""I'ma pull the pulse out a soldier and bolt""
Fine, sign of the time we elapse
When a primate climb up a spine and attach
Eye for an eye, by the bog life swamps and vines
They get a rise out of frogs and flies
So when a dogfight's hog-tied prize sort of costs a life
The mouths water on a fork and knife
And the allure isn't right
No score on a war-torn beach
Where the cash cow's actually beef
Blood turns wine when it leak for police
Like, ""That's not a riot; it's a feast, let's eat!""

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass

Now, if you never had a day a snow cone couldn't fix
You wouldn't relate to the rogue vocoder blitz
How he spoke through a NoDoz motor on the fritz
‘Cause he wouldn't play rollover fetch like a bitch
And express no regrets, though he isn't worth a homeowner's piss
To the jokers who pose by the glitz
Fine, sign of the swine in the swarm
When a king is a whore who comply and conform
Miles outside of the eye of the storm
With a siphon to lure out a prize and award
While avoiding the vile and bizarre that is violence and war
True blue triumph is more
Like, ""Wait, let it snake up out of the centerfold
Let it break the walls of Jericho, ready go""
Sat where the old, cardboard city folk
Swap tales with heads, like every other penny throw

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast
And I will rejoice in your fall from grace
With a cane to the sky, like, ""None shall pass""
None shall pass, none shall pass
You tried, you tried, you tried to trick me
You've got a, you've, you've got a, a lot of nerve
I'm, I'm not, I'm not, trying to trick you
I'm try, I'm try, I'm trying to help
Okay, woke to a grocery list, goes like this:
Duty and Death
Anyone object, come stand in the way
You could be my little Snake River Canyon today
And I ran with a chain of commands
And a jetpack strapped where the backstab lands if it can
Fine, sign of the vibe in the crowd
When I cut a belly open to find what climb out
That's quite a bit of gusto he muster up
To make a dark horse rush, like, ""Enough's enough!""
It must've struck a nerve so they huff and puff
'Til all the king's men fluster and clusterfuck
And it's a beautiful thing
To my people who keep an impressive wingspan
Even when the cubicle shrink
You got to pull up the intruder by the root of the weed
N.Y. Chew through the machine

And I will remember your name and face
On the day you are judged by The Funhouse cast

Duke of early retirement picket dream
American Nightmare hogging the screen

If you'd stop following me around the jungle gym
Now it's honor, and I spell it with the 'H' I stole from heritage
Merit crutched on the wretched refuse of my teeming resonance
I promise, tempest-tossed breed with a bleeding conscience
See, the creed accents responsive but my sports divorced the wattage
And I'm sleeping now — wow! —yeah, the settlers laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when the buzzards drag your brother's flags to rags
You won't be laughing when your front lawn is spangled with epitaphs (You won't be laughing!)

Divvy crumbs for the better souls
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a lowlife countin' on one hand what he's accomplished
Okay, link me to activism chain activate street sweep
Plug deteriorating cenobite pendragon
I hock spores coursed by the morbid
Spreading of mad men, Alley gospel
Sinking your Lincoln-Log cabin and Charlie Chaplin waddle
I could zig-zag and zig 'em again
For the badge dreams sparkle in my brick wall windows
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Without the wretched; Houston, we have a problem
Attached to the festive batch of city goblins
Who split holiday freaks on a box cut cinema high road bellow
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow
Sort of similar to most backbones at camp Icarus
Where all fiddler crabs congregate and get pampered for bickering
Life's not a bitch, life is a beautiful woman

Kiss the speaker wire Peter/pacifism pegging threshold

I got a friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast

We don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie talkies
We don't need your coughing when offing the morning coffee
No, we don't need no walkie-talkies, nope no walkie-talkies
We just want our hermitry to stay and our coffee to go

And the last shall be
First to immerse in the pass out heat
Face in the mud where the moxie melt
'Till he woke up drowning in tchotchke hell
More in a cave with a torch on the wall
Than a window arrangement of porcelain dolls
On a brand new day, saw what he saw
Property owners who crawl to the mall
With a bad toupee and a face like he author the law
Pace like he mourning a loss
Right hand on a can of worms
Left full of gold he will trade for turf, I mean
That's ok, you got to answer to you at the end of the volatile day
But a model of mercy and might, no way
Marionette who will clap and obey
Dude, look, all that noise
Call that flight of the water boys
Meet and greet and they all slap five
Cheek to cheek when they colonize
And a grown-ass man shall abide as he wish
Walk that path with a dime and a stick
Walk that path with a diamond and wine
Walk that path to the firing line
Just walk, pay no mind
To the new recruit with the play-doh spine
Let's be friends from opposite ends
Wave to the kid don't hop on the fence
Play to the radius far and away
Orbit wide don't park in his space
One little martyr who talk in his face
Make one little Weathermen sharpen the blades

Face in the bars of a regular cell
When he woke up high in collectible hell
Boom town kid who was taught by the binge
That a man who expire with the most shit win
That's warpy American nonsense penned by the rich
Not a routine friend in a pinch
Still not used to the stench
How it throws off otherwise lucid events
In the case the afraid observe
I got a Pro-Keds box full of layman's terms, it goes
Hey, peace, pray for the plagued
Major relief and capacious rains
But just cuz I don't want to war with you
It don't mean go warm up the barbecue
I'm like pardon you, sawed off limit
My high noon is a quick little minute
I don't wanna spend it sitting with a critic
Who simply isn't going to ever really get it
This HQ is alive and alone
No driveway no sign of a home
No dial tone, no line for the phone
No world's tiniest violin song
And I might just lie to them all, lie in the morgue
With a deep breath hiding and bored
Fighting a smile, highly annoyed

Used to draw
Hard to admit that I used to draw
Portraiture and the human form
Doodle of a two-headed unicorn—it was soothing
Movin' his arm in a fusion of man-made tools and a muse from beyond
Even if it went beautifully wrong
It was tangible truth for a youth who refused to belong
No name nuisance, stews in a bedroom
Oozing a brand-new cuneiform
Barely commune with the horde
Got a whole grayscale ungluing his world
Might zone out to the yap of the magpie
Unseen hand dragging his graphite
Cross contour, little bit of backlight
Black ink after a Bristol to baptize
You can't imagine the rush that ensue
When you get three dimensions stuffed into two
Then it's off to a school where it's all that you do
Being trained and observed by a capable few
Back in New York, five peeps and a dog
In a two-bedroom, doing menial jobs
Plus, rhymin' and stealin' and being a clod
Distractions free to maraud
I left some years a deer in the light
I left some will to spirit away
I let my fears materialize
I let my skills deteriorate
Haunted by the thought of what I should have been continuing
A mission that was rooted in a twenty-year affinity
In rickety condition with an ID crisis
Nap on the front lawn, look up in the sky, it's…

Shapes falling out of the fringe

They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings
Used to paint
Hard to admit that I used to paint
Natural light on a human face
Stenciled fire on his roommate's bass
It was blooming addiction
Amiss in the pushing of pigment
Book like a tattooed pigskin, look
Pinhead kids of the minute
Drank Kool-Aid from a tube of acrylic
And it grew up into linseed oil over linen
Joy to the poison, voice of the resin
Capture a map of the gesture
Back up, add a little accurate fat to the figure
Redo that, move that inward
Zinc white lightning shoots from his fingers
Studio strewn with illusion and tinctures
Stay tuned for the spooky adventures
You can't imagine the stars that align
When a forearm starts foreshortening right
Or a torso hung on a warping spine
In proportion reads as warm and alive
Routine day with a dirt cheap brush
Then a week goes by and it goes untouched
Then two, then three, then a month
And the rest of your life, you beat yourself up
I left some seasons eager to fall
I left some work to bury alive
I let my means of being dissolve
I let my person curl up and die
Eating up his innards, an unfeasible anxiety
Has brutally committed to relinquishing his privacy
Aligning with the trials of the anti-Midas
Nap on the back lawn, look up in the sky, it's…
Shapes falling out of the fringe
All heart, though we would've made cowardly kings
They will chop you down just to count your rings
Just to count your rings, just to count your rings

Look…
Unsigned hype, front line aeronauts flurry
Zero dark thirty
Zero Friends minotaur-fugly stepchild
Evoke lunch jumped over plunging necklines
Up, beside tongue-tied hungry enzymes
Devolved into mothmen munching textiles
Punisher, out past go-time
Back 10 fried worms chubbier
Brown grass both sides
Canned food, manmade tools
Lanacane, band aids, mandrake root
Bindle on a broomstick, pancaked shoes
And a handshake-proof campaign, can’t lose
Can’t gain
Smoke out moles like a force of nature
Pray fortune return to his favor, swiftly
Maybe in the form of a nest egg
Maybe in the form of a Tesla death ray
Or a solid gold scene with something better to celebrate
Than powder on a face like a flatfoot on jelly day
M-m-moral compass all batshit
Spinning in the shadows of immoral magnets
Are we supporting the artist or enabling the addict?
I mean, I guess it matters to me, I wish it mattered to you

Hello! Here’s where a tale of caution
Pounds coffin nails to bootlegs of Hawkwind
Saw tooth, nevermind straw to gold
Spin hearts on sleeves into heads on poles
Arm in the maw
Fish out pith like a business card from a jar at the mall
A-alike androids dreaming of carbon applause
Get stuffed with cartoon cigars
Cold pack, neti-pot, home to roost
Around folk backed into what they most lampoon
Shook to the fevered brow and broke ankles
Daisy, declawed pound, no thank you
Fade me, failed all basic training
But I spent a couple groundhog days with a changeling

Uh, greasy grimy gopher guts
Poolside, 0 for 1, I don't forget spoons twice
Lukewarm Folgers, mold on his moonpie
Rooms in his home that dissipate into fruit flies
Suicide lane wide load ride looting in the wake of an amicable marooning
My duty go from moving in packs, to sharing food with a cat
To ""Ma, it's me, I accidentally sawed a woman in half""
She said ""I'll keep you in my prayers,"" I said ""I need to hide a body""
She said ""Ok, honey, talk to you on Friday""
Apparently we share a common plasma so the growing disconnection doesn't matter, according to the blood-and-water chapter
Weird, who wrote the blood-and-water chapter anyway?
Probably some surly dad, only child, 30 cats
Looking for a way to reconnect with an averted past
Except it doesn't always work like that

Today I pulled three baby snakes out of moss and dirt
Where the wild strawberry vines toss and turn
I told them, ""You will grow to be something inventive and electric;
You are healthy, you are special, you are present""
Then I let them go
Oh...

You were sitting at the gate awaiting spirits and provisions
I was privy to a headache over pirouetting innards
In the mirror sweating pitchers
Who's there: simian or lizard?
As it were there is a disappearing difference
In ambition and material
Antiquated gentleman outlaws reduced to a ferris wheel of vitriol
Move as a godless heathen: black gums, tooth gone, bootleg 'Yukon Cornelius'
I'm a... That's better, here we here we go
Disenchanted face printed on a zero-dollar bill
Got a little plot of land where authority isn't recognized
Contraband keeping the core of his Hyde Jekyll-ized
Check! Never mind a misanthrope vying for affection to the wretched sound of mysticism dying
It is something he must handle on his own
The windblown way
Wanna win? Don't play

Today I pulled three green frogs out of leaf and bark
Where the grapevines climb a convenient barn
I told them, ""You will grow to be something tenacious and exalted;
You are mighty, you are gracious, you are lauded""
Then I let them go
Oh...

I have been completely unable to maintain any semblance of relationship on any level
I have been a bastard to the people who have actively attempted to deliver me from peril
I have been acutely undeserving of the ear that listen up and lip that kissed me on the temple
I have been accustomed to a stubborn disposition that admits it wish its history disassembled
I have been a hypocrite in sermonizing tolerance while skimming for a ministry to pretzel
I have been unfairly resentful of those I wish that acted different when the bidding was essential
I have been a terrible communicator prone to isolation over sympathy for devils
I have been my own worst enemy since the very genesis of rebels

Today I pulled three ghost crabs out of rock and sand
Where the low tide showcased a promised land
I told them, ""You will grow to be something dynamic and impressive;
You are patient, you are gallant, you are festive""
Then I let them go
Oh

And probably hoarding 40 more in the corners of Fort Knox
Swapped 20 on the spot and cop the warlock
Back at the haunt, found God in the hamper
Briefs on her head playing Walking With a Panther
Good around misery and golden era samplers

Question: If I died in my apartment like a rat in a cage
Would the neighbors smell the corpse before the cat ate my face?
I used to floss the albatross like Daddy Kane with the chain
I'm trying to jettison the ballast with the hazardous waste
The kid is comfortably numb, routine a tedious crutch
Steep in a self-imposed Stockholm and Lima in flux
Maybe an occupation popular with demons and ducks
Made any mingling akin to being seasoned and stuffed
It's a theatre of jumping jellyfish, jealous little sycophants
Miserable and flimsy from the skippies to the pissy pants
Each one separately convinced
They're sketching with Da Vinci's hands
Delusion turned the communication to prison camp
You fucking dorks ain't a threat to the cause
There ain't a lesson we can learn from the ostensibly lost
I think it's funny when defendants from identical haunts
Step out the tempest, a measure of what the spectrum involves
Maybe no one cares
Party over here, I'll be over there

Don't need no help, all by myself

I used to hang around with rappers at the root of the scene
It meant a lot to feel the fugitive community breathe
Maybe to sentimentalize is to be truly naive
I know some shit about your heroes that you wouldn't believe
I think we're all a bunch of weirdos on a quest to belong
This song's our echolocation up in impregnable fog
That's why it's odd to see a pile of imperfections and flaws
Ascend a pedestal to patronize the rest of the cogs
In a mess of obnoxious fantasy, posturing and pageantry
I ain't even mad, I'm impressed, shit it's baffling
God almighty, chop an ivory tower to piano keys
Play your own dirge on the way to surfing maggot beach
You fuckin' dorks ain't a source of the art
You can't be cooler than the corners
Where you source all your parts
The poker-faced, all it takes a couple sordid remarks
We let the manticore out, We make the sorcery bark

Insecurities exploding in emotional code

Corrode a homie 'til his probity is notably ghost
Before the hobby was a job, he was a miniature hell
You would wobble round your momma like an infant gazelle
The disillusionment has truly been a difficult pill
But you as anything menacing is a difficult sell
In a whistle and bell-o-rama
Black mollies that dress up like piranha
It's not even compelling melodrama
It's a comedy, somebody wanna shop you as a saga
I'm very voluntarily persona non grata
You fuckin' dorks ain't the leaders we need

Tech support, feral army
In a cave on a failed bit of terraforming
Four corners of paranormal
Get shorn for a thermos and pair of thermals
In the warehouse air where his dairy curdles
St. Vincent de Paul trying to square the circle
Circle the source of his power
Foresight born at the corner of Howard on sale
Cherry pick blue in the pale
It's a blue-nose chewin' his tail, losing his coat
Schmoozing a high and a head-rush
Hack up bile over H1N1, and then some
One eye on the breadcrumbs
Other eye on the Drencrom
Other other eye on the income
Good knife and a grin
Shoot dice with the lice and the ring worms
Peg leg, smells like Medellin
Wake in the night, make a pipe out of anything
Take 5, take a dive in the cellophane
Turn 5 into 5 6 7 8
Back out, black out somewhere fancy
Shaped like the backseat of Aesop's Camry, dude...
Seat full of chips and sandwich meat from the crypt
In the end if you give an address in a river of piss
Don't question the mystery fish
Just picture shrimp on a pillow of grits
Close your eyes, lick your lips

My first name is a random set of numbers and letters
And other alphanumerics that changes hourly forever
My last name, a thousand vowels fading down a sinkhole to a susurrus
It couldn't just be ""John Doe"" or ""Bingo""
My address, a made-up language written out in living glyphs
Lifted from demonic literature and religious text
Telephone, uncovered by purveyors of the ouija
When checked against the CBGB women's room graffiti
My social, a sudoku; my age is obscure
My in-case-of-emergency is in the daisies, chasing birds
Employed by trillionaires with perfect teeth and pores
And people who open doors for the people who open doors
My medical history is a course at SUNY Buffalo
Charlatan psychiatry and troubleshooting undertow
Nervous in the service, still; I'm burger meat and purple pills

You pack up all your manias, you're sitting in the waiting room
You're dreaming of arcadia, you're feeling like a baby tooth
Awaiting panacea, channeling your inner Beowulf
In purgatory, just before you pay up to filet yourself and others
In the name of help, coal on a conveyor belt
Into ego death alone, no telephone from Gabriel
I'm half a human, combin' over Home and Garden, stoned
Gold chains over turtleneck, cigars over cologne
A thousand shitty paintings wrapped around a wounded animal
Woo him with the Schubert, he's a future human cannonball
Little fuckers fighting, mother hiding in her Hulu
I'm climbing up the stucco, let's get to the seppuku—uh-oh

Little brother, left field, queen's guard, mean arm
Knees bent, two out, two on bags
When I caught him staring down at something moving through the grass
Hold up; tagged runner, and the whole cast rotate
Not before he could identify the culprit
Granny yelling, ""Go Cubs!"" Graham yelling, ""Gopher!""
New left fielder give a fuck about a homer
Got a homie, little rodent, head and shoulders out his hovel
No baseball in the bubble, ruh-roh
Parents thought it adorable, the players followed suit
Inning crawling to a close, head coach not amused
Coach seeing red, coach on the diamond
Dragging 27 inches of aluminum behind him
When he transverse third, the families turn nervous
The following is a transcript of ""Man vs. Vermin""
Here we go: man stands out by a hole
Pest pops up to patrol
Man plays live Whac-a-Mole
In a scene that would try every child as adults
Whoa, pall-bore with a ball mitt
Thrown over the fence, coach hit the bench
Both teams lose, ""Good game, good game""
Granny yelling ""Go Cubs!"" Cubs ain't playing

Neubauten tee, plaid flannel-laden, adolescent art kid
Tony Hawk hair, Skinny Puppy denim
And a record player vomiting Alien Sex Fiend, Peel Sessions
In a Christian home for field testing
It's real youth in the palm of your hand
When your mom thinks Satan is involved in a band
We were buried in the Village Voice, checking who was playing where
Pulled his head up out the paper, pushing out a single tear
Five words, like a beacon of light in the mist:
""Ministry live at the Ritz""
It was ""Christ Has Risen"" to Chris, three loaves, two fish
Miracle of mechanized loops on two-inch
Coming to a theater—he would be there in the flesh
Moms didn't say ""No,"" but she didn't say ""Yes""
Cop tickets—ah, the plot thickens
Countdown to ultimate concert experience
Ma still wary: ""And why are they called Ministry?
Are they a cult?"" Maybe she would probably investigate
Bought a mag with an Al Jourgensen interview
Read a couple sentences, glanced at a pic or two or three
That's all—no fair trial
Simply, ""You will not be going to the show, and that's final!""
What occurred next were the top of the lungs
Of a son who, unjustly, had lost what he loved
In a moment that would transcend anger to high art
Said, ""This is something I am willing to die for!""
Can you even imagine?
A death in the fam from industrial fandom?
Anyway, no body count, no concert
And Chris kicked rocks in his mismatched Converse
My older brother is a funny dude

We hadn't spoken in a couple moons

I see how y'all be trying to front, man

Been a bit since Mu died
Been a lot more loss in the wake
I recall thinking, ""Someday, someone's gonna say it's all from the same cause and effect""
And I just couldn't fathom blaming a whole new page on a made-up chain reaction
Each claim individual peaks and pockets
Pains and a slew of unique nuances

It's a lot to process
Gone from a happier jack-in-the-box
To a package of clogged up chakras
Oh, shazbat! Not the ""ever after"" he wanted
From the ""Once upon a time, dot, dot, dot""
Once upon a time, he was so much more
Than a punchline for his own potshots, ah
Watch the Impossible Kid
Everything that he touch turns promptly to shit
If I zoom on out, I can finally admit
It's all been a blur since Mu got sick
None of the subsequent years stood a chance
Whether you his moms or his mans
Whether you his pops or his girl, I was poison
Heart full of canines, head full of voices
Whole life trying to quiet 'em down
Like a suicide king with a knife in his crown
Hounds at bay, but they just won't stay
True friendship in a tugboat way
Ae go dark in the face of the fucked
When the fucked was a friend, that was basically done
Into the woods go his alien tongue
It was that or a textbook faking of funk, and I can't
Here go the hindsight:
Eight years been one long blindside
I could pinpoint seven more turns that occurred 'cause he never really healed from the first
Oh, what a world, any hack is a myth
Any dap is a joke, any map is a trick
Any graph is a hoax, ease on down
I'm burning up, I'm bleeding out
Knowing ain't half the battle

Somebody in a cultivated moment of distress
Composed themselves enough to artfully carve ""Zoso"" in his desk
They was probably thinking ""Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!"" in they head
With a hell bound arm in a acidy wash
Homemade curfew a thousand o'clock
And the pot leaf tattoo his friend did drunk
Like a badge of mystique though it technically sucked
Taking the name of the father in vain
On the way to the blade in his locker
Estranged
A switch he lifted from a sibling's skivvy drawer
Who'd branched off into ninja stars
And never knew his shit was sharked to
Here with a higher purpose
And a primal urge of juvenile berserkers
Like Crocea Mors in a arcade drop claw
Gouging a valentine for Miss Othmar

S is the most difficult to control

Beyond gross but evoked a host of “oh dip”

Heart of a cat with a lark in his mouth

Baseheads locally approach all spark plugs
Total disregard for a dying man's shark jump
Post-meridiem pretty tungsten attracts any once-pale horse painted gunmetal black
Face masking, hard-shelled ebony propeller hat
Clubmans, gloved rakes grappling the clutch span
Tuck go the steel toe, metal gate spreading
For the dead-alive that rented parking space 37
2000 out the weekly under ""Cycles to Gehenna"" gets him floating over 20 buses
Fireproof and festive
Corners like a two-tired tiger so a too-tired rider can accumulate a few excited fibers to assign
Knows no zen in the art of maintenance
Only as the orchestrated patron saint of changing lanes baby
Here is how a great escape goes when you can't take your dead friends names out your phone

Eyes and teeth, new moon on a scale that defies belief
Outside what our fundamental sciences teach, every other mighty lion asleep
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth
Gangway - mine eyes, mine teeth

The man-ape translates glam thru the visor
Goes in water lillies
Am-scrays Giger, and man-ray
Crammed in a one-player campaign
Blinker like a hallowed bonfire over Samhain
Span where the praying hands mandate
Bars an extension of the arms
They're mutating instead of being farmed
Tonight beneath a marmalade Venus
Haunted mowers chewing every glowing yard of mud between us
Going Ford, Jag, Datsun, Corvette, Lotus
All cones you can slalom when your Zorlac's focused
Via mechanical Dartmoor Frankensteined poorly
And sanctioned by a New Yank Yorkee
Who knew that any moment he could lose it to the decopaged suicide flooring
And still he keep his fuel tank portly, the 30 odd year old gears thank Charlie
The scarf thank Mom's new hobby, kssssht! copy

Hug a double yellow spine

Zoom in to the fuming of an aggravated breed
Via the study of post-adolescent agitated seeds
Half the patients wasted self prior to Commencement
So I focus on the urban Oxygen samples, the half that made it breathe
They sold Pompeii impression, waste infections
And twelve steps to lesson
Cretins swiftly tippy toe on hard to swallow, barter concepts
The give-it get-it, never let it self passport our stubbornness
Martyrs talks money causes in a harvesting Spartacus
And so on I've thrown long Hail Mary bombs
Toward cookie-cutter Mother Natures bedazzled synthetic fabrics
Life treats the peasants like
They tried to fuck his woman while he slept inside
Well they're merely chasing perfectionist emblems
When the clock strikes nine
I'll be waking with the best of routine caffeine team players
For the cycle of it
Under a dusted angel harp string Big Brother is watching
My odometer like buzzard to fallen elk, talking stealth
We got babies, rubber stamps, and briefcase parts
We on some door-to-door now
Order ten dollars or more, we'll shove it down your throat for free
I'll sacrifice my inborn tendencies
For copper pennies for one commanding ""Gimme that""
So we can retain baby fat
Make the biter snake bedlam
Holocaust freak, heckle shiesty brain headroom shaped planet
Make a move, pause, make a move break cannon
Bent barrel one eight zero, U-Turn, squeeze, end it
It's on like it's never been
It's bleeding well
It's bigger than a breadbox
It corrodes my leaky finance
I'll take my seat atop the Brooklyn Bridge
With a Coke and a bag of chips
To watch a thousand lemmings plummet just because
The first one slipped
Sometimes I laugh at victory, kissing these little question marks
I tend to underestimate my average
Just another bastard savage
Someday you'll all eat out of my cold hand
Cuz every dog has its day
At which point, I'll pull it away

Yo, ask her
Hey, Lucy, come here
Lucy, how old are you?
Lucy, come here
Lucy
Hey, Lucy, how old are you?
Lucy!

Lucy was 7 and wore a head of blue barrettes
City born, into this world with no knowledge and no regrets
Had a piece of yellow chalk with which she'd draw upon the street
The many faces of the various locals that she would meet
There was Joshua, age 10, bully of the block
Who always took her milk money at the morning bus stop
There was Mrs. Crabtree and her poodle
She always gave a wave and holler
On her weekly trip down to the bingo parlor
And she drew
Men, women, kids, sunsets, clouds
And she drew
Skyscrapers, fruit stands, cities, towns
Always said hello to passersby
They'd ask her why she passed her time
Attaching lines to concrete, but she would only smile
Now all the other children living in or near her building
Ran around like tyrants, soaking up the open fire hydrants
They would say
""Hey, little Lucy, wanna come jump double dutch?""
Lucy would pause, look, grin and say
""I'm busy, thank you much""
Well, well, one year passed and believe it or not
She covered every last inch of the entire sidewalk
And she stopped-
""Lucy, after all this, you're just giving in today?""
She said:
""I'm not giving in, I'm finished,"" and walked away

Now Lucy was 37, and introverted somewhat
Basement apartment in the same building she grew up in
She traded in her blue barettes for long locks held up with a clip
Traded in her yellow chalk for charcoal sticks
And she drew
Little Bobby who would come to sweep the porch
And she drew
The mailman, delivered everyday at 4
Lucy had very little contact with the folks outside her cubicle day
But found it suitable, and she liked it that way
She had a man now: Rico, similar, hermit
They would only see each other once or twice a week on purpose
They appreciated space and Rico was an artist too
So they'd connect on Saturdays to share the pictures that they drew (Look!)
Now every month or so, she'd get a knock upon the front door
Just one of the neighbors
Acting nice although she was a strange girl, really
Say, ""Lucy, wanna join me for some lunch?""
Lucy would smile and say ""I'm busy, thank you much""
And they would make a weird face the second the door shut
And run and tell their friends how truly crazy Lucy was
And Lucy knew what people thought but didn't care
'Cause while they spread their rumors through the street
She'd paint another masterpiece
1-2-3, that's the speed of the seed
A-B-C, that's the speed of the need

You can dream a little dream or you can live a little dream
I'd rather live it, 'cause dreamers always chase but never get it

Lucy was 87, upon her death bed
At the senior home, where she had previously checked in
Traded in the locks and clips for a head rest
Traded in the charcoal sticks for arthritis, it had to happen
And she drew no more, just sat and watched the dawn
Had a television in the room that she'd never turned on
Lucy pinned up a life's worth of pictures on the wall
And sat and smiled, looked each one over, just to laugh at it all
No Rico, he had passed about 5 years back
So the visiting hours pulled in a big flock of nothing
She'd never spoken once throughout the spanning of her life
Until the day she leaned forward, grinned and pulled the nurse aside
And she said:
""Look, I've never had a dream in my life
Because a dream is what you wanna do, but still haven't pursued
I knew what I wanted and did it till it was done
So I've been the dream that I wanted to be since day one!""
Well! The nurse jumped back
She'd never heard Lucy even talk
Especially words like that
She walked over to the door, and pulled it closed behind
Then Lucy blew a kiss to each one of her pictures
And she died

So when the piranhas honor New York
My daddy long legs dangled and mangled for sport
And while I bring in every dink in the kingdom with open wings
It all boils down to them shit-soaked pigs
The pigs (what), the pigs (what), the dregs of what y'all aim for
The gluttonous muddy stomachs under the pudgy cakehole
Two-track braniac using the food and payroll
To chew up and consume every cookie, crumb, and peso

Mine, plus I toss a token where I go:
Directly to the worms who shovel shit and yellow snow

Abaddon threshold, flash forged in a galley
With undead orcs pulling oars through the algae
Smash cut to a smoke-bombed quarantine
Guards like, ""All signs correlate with sorcery""
It's more a dormant cell of valor as awoken by the smell of sordid power
And defecting shortly after
Fist bump dry land, brackish
Cat nap 15, back to swiss-cheese the flagship, uh
Blue in the menacing grip of a day for which you're manifestly unfit

Final answer ""not to be"", ""not to be"" is right!
Next question - to build winged shoes or autophagy
Silk-screen band tees, take apart a VCR
Ringer off, canned peas, cabin fever mi amor
Patently adhering to the chandelier at key-in-door
To usher in the understated anarchy of leisureforce
Led a purple tongue and ratty Caballeros
Up over the black rainbow into the house of mirrors
To become a thousand zeroes, echoing a twisted alchemy
Freak flags, fluttering to circadian free jazz
Sleep apnea, scratching, ""bring that beat back""
I doze off, clothes on, nose in the feedbag
Shhh... Om nom, nom, blinds drawn
Compost thrown to the spine pile, bygones
Mangy, intimately spaced pylons
On a plot of inhospitable terrain, ""Hi mom!""

Day turns night, day turns night
Day turns night, day turns night

Night Light, sucka!!!

Put one up for shackle me not clean logic procreation
I did invent the wheel, in a previous generation
While the triple sixers' lassos keep angels roped in the basement
I locate modern halos and pass 'em out to the cavemen
Y'all catch a 30-second flash frame
Dirty cooperative med platoon
Bloom, head-trip split fantastic!
Fathom the splicing of major-league low-life
With anti-hero earthworm mentality – Godzilla!
I pace my game for zero-hour completion
See, a cretin's still a cretin, even speakin' altered moniker
American nightmare lost in the monitor
I'll hold the door open, so you can stagger through
Then send berserker-bred Jukies in after you
It's Gutter, and I spell it with the 'G' I stole from ""Get the fuck up!""
Noise crutch stolen wretched refuse of my teeming dumb luck
Still I promise: temperance towards breed still bleeding Amish
See, the freaks sucked out the wattage
While three bears invade the cottage
And I can't sleep now! Yeah, the police'll laugh
You won't be laughing when your covered wagons crash
You won't be laughing when you're hosted
By the ghost of Christmas past
You won't be laughing when your blow-up doll's got a headache and won't give up the ass
I'ma lay my kicks to rest when I'm impressed
So I staple-gun 'em to my feet
This origami dream is beautiful: pull the tail, watch the wings flap

I'm pretty sure I got a pulse
Plus we Shimmy cross the centerfold, and our night light engulfed
Just let me keep the crumbs (Please!)
With seven deadly stains, adhere the blame to crystal conscience
The result's a dead-beat tryin' to make a dollar off a bomb threat
Okay, link me to activism chain, activate wild-style Pluto orbit
Set a course, then push the button
I swallow spores born by the laws
Of a morbid glutton– Alley gospel
I can spot a duck battalion by the Charlie Chaplin waddle (gone)
Zig-zag and zig 'em again
Before the pig can pull a badge out for the lash out
Another thick installment of one night in Gotham
Like, ""Houston, we have a problem: they're buffing the trains the same day the graffiti writers bomb 'em!""
Who split holiday freaks on box-cut cinema high road bellow?
Head gripped, watch red bricks turn yellow!
I'm tryin' to meet the wizard, but a tailgating tin-man holding a oil can won't let a hermit crab break in his new shell-toes
Life's not a bitch: life is a beyotch
Who keeps the villagers circling the marketplace
Out searching for the g-spot
Maybe she didn't feel y'all shared any similar interests
Or maybe you're just an asshole – maybe I'm just an asshole!
Kiss the speaker wire (*kiss*)
Sammy Swashbuckler pagan threshhold
Stomach full of diner food, wingspan cast black upon views
Here to help release the rabid hounds or pick apart your mood
I got this friend of polar nature, and it's all peace
You and I seek similar stars but can't sit at the same feast
Metal Captain, this cat is askin' if I've seen his bit of lost passion
I told him: ""Yeah,"" and gave him one last look and smashed him

The kid that work down at the local Baskin-Robbins
Got a tattoo of a lipstick print attached above his collar
I watched him relocating pistachio to a waffle
Thinking I had lost the plot if not the passion for the novel
He asked me what I wanted, I ordered something daft
He said he liked the tattoo Alex drew me of the bats
Thanks; I like it too but modestly confess
In present company, my coloring is not the main event
Look at that neck
The message is immediate, the guy effs chicks
I spent a lot of years making friends with cool artists
So when they drew me tattoos I could truly feel important
Now some 22 year old inside a cube of brick and mortar
Got me questioning my morals and their corny pecking order
I should give a shit less
Cherry-No; Whip-Yes

Lotta years
Uh, lotta years

The girl that work down at the local juice place
Got a head full of dreadlocks down to her waist
I watched her add the spinach to the ginger to the grapes
My hair was underwhelming, my juice was fucking great
Some lady orders Maca, compliments the locks
She asked how many years it took the girl to grow the crop
""It took a lot of years and then eventually I cut 'em, kept 'em
Reattach 'em anytime I want 'em""
My mind's fucking blown
The future is amazing, I feel so fucking old
I bet you clone your pets and ride a hover-board to work
I used a folding map to find the juice place in the first
These kids are running wild, I'm still recovering from church
You should have seen me in the 90s, I could ollie up a curb
You should have seen me in the 80s

Only big boys keep deuces on the ride

Bulletproof under T-shirts because they hate us
Do like Snoop say, step your game up
Double-decker boat nigga, Meditterane' up
D-Class Asscher cuts, tuck your chain up
Liberace fingers, niggas hit Lorraine up
Just last week, I was out in Aspen
Me and Puff hoppin' off the plane, both us laughin'
A week before that, I was out in Italy
Italian heartthrobs could not get rid of me
Up in Donatella crib, me and like ten hoes
Call from the cell phone, ""Give me that Enzo"" (Yes,sir)

Been two years like I was paddy wagon cruisin'
Streets was yours, you're dunce cappin' and kazooin'

Pyrex stirs turned into Cavalli furs
The full-length cat, when I wave, the kitty purrs (Meow)
All my niggas caked up, sellin' gray and beige dust
Have that money right or end up in the trunk taped up
We don't chase or duck, we only race for bucks
Peel money rolls 'til our thumbs get the paper cuts

I'm from Virginia, where ain't shit to do but cook (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Pack it up, sell it triple price, fuck the books (Talkin' 'bout what?)
Where we re-up, relocate, re-off them rooks (Talkin' 'bout what?)
So when we pull up, it ain't shit to do but look (Talkin' 'bout what?)

In my home sweet home, I keep chrome next to my bones
Alters my walk to limpin', since I love the feel
I guess I'm passionately pimpin', it is what it seems
That thing imprintin' through the seam of my jeans, by all means
Lost it all, from lives to love
But my faith and my money helped me rise above
See, I turned to the Lord when them times got tough
Bullied through the streets, powder I pushed and shoved
In that ol' Virginny, out of ten niggas, nine are guinea
No money, all they know is gimme
Got semis waitin', heat like Caribbean summers
I been there, each year, a different bitch wonder
Who wing she gon' fall under
Push' or Mal', Gonz or Grimes
With me, with thoughts of fuckin' them cross her mind
Look ma, that's right up my alley
I love my family, I want them all happy
In Virginia, we smirked at the Simpson trial
Yeah, I guess the chase was wild, but what's the fuss about?
See, plenty my partners feelin' like OJ

""Malice, he think he hard, tough guy of the clique
And Pusha, he walk around like he swear he the shit""

Don't ask about my music and how that's comin' 'bout
Don't ask about my album, or when's it comin' out
'Cause I feel like you really being funny on the sly

But don't get it twisted, the Uzi's in the lining though
Hollow tip dum-dums eat flesh like piranhas though
Such a scary thing to hear the soul sing, ""Geronimo""
Pull up in the CL, the shit's astronomical
Hoes lining up on the curb, they fall like dominoes
Used to have this white bitch, she looked like Madonna though
Heard that she fucking LeBron, but shit, I don't know
Like that, Bron-Bron? I had that long time ago
Butt-naked on the balcony at the Dolla-no
I mean the Delano, I mean, Pharrell'll know
The head shop bitch from D.C., ayy, P, let 'em know
(Yeah, that bitch was hot, nigga)
Yeah, yeah, but it was time to go
Them hoes come in eeny, meeny, miny, moe

But call me uncle, yeah, Uncle Cam
I tax 'em (Like who?) Like Uncle Sam (Uh)
From the jungle, fam, where niggas bundle grams
Fumble or you crumble, get murked on the humble and
The gat on the belt on the hip
And I keep it for real with the clips
Drive a hard bargain (Bargain)
I'm Harlem's only Gagarin, car foreign

Goddamn, the boy's back
From pushing a mountain of Sno-Caps to avoiding the Kojak
The pioneer of the coke rap
I'm dancing with the stars, stepping on blow, doing the toe-tap
The dope returned like I had it on LoJack
It made its way home like a road map, I fathered this
If I misled any kid that's fatherless
That burden's on my soul as long I exist
Generation lost, they saying they can't reach us
The answer is the Lord like Saturday Night Fever
I kept it in the crib, it made me a light sleeper
Whether watching for the feds or avoiding the Grim Reaper
Way deeper than rap, money and hoes, it's deeper than that
Fight the temptation, but it keep coming back
Money stacked to the ceiling just as quick as it dispense
Who knew them commas meant you could lose your common sense?
Before it's too late, all I can tell 'em is repent, uh
Mami, you miss me, don't you?
Haters, wish you could hit me, don't you? (This shit is crazy out here, nigga)
Huh, you should call me uncle

Let 'em know, daddy, Mr. Lee, haha

Fear him, as soon as you hear him
Upon my arrival, the dope dealers cheer him (Got it for cheap)
Just like a revival, the verse tends to steer 'em
Through a life in the fast lane, I German engineer 'em
No serum can cure all the pain I've endured
From crack to rap to back to selling it pure
For every record I potentially sell in the store
It's like Mecca to the dealer that's selling it raw
So many deceive ya
I'm more in touch with the keys, move over Alicia
I force feed ya the metric scale
Rap's like child's play, my show and tell
Within each verse, you see the truth's unveiled
They manufacture proof as they lie to themselves
Puppets on the string like a yo-yo
Bouncing like a pogo, they praying I never go solo

Might hurt ya once, but never no more
It's like tryin to fly but they clippin' your wings
And that's exactly why the caged bird sings
Who can nickname it? The shame rings true
Seems to me reparations are overdue
I done been to the top, I done sipped the juice
And with that being said, bird crumbs'll never do
Even on my last, not a penny in the bank
I'ma stand on my own, so thanks, but no thanks
Keep the pranks as I bid farewell (Uh)
I gotta answer to Marcus and Jennelle
And to little brother Terrence who I love dearly so
If ever I had millions, never would you push blow, never (G-g-got it for cheap)

The spirit of competition, one verse could start jihad

Pullin' the covers back, I expose what you disguise
My presence is felt, the pressure is on
A 4'11"" Cuban helped us weather the storm
Pyrex and powder, it was back to the norm
Through all the adversity, the fury was born

Niggas don't get the picture, it's written in scripture
Even ask your mama, she'll tell you that blood's thicker
And I don't know how them other niggas built
And I don't know if ever they feel guilt
Or maybe niggas just too high on they stilts
But this one's on me, I'ma view it as spilt milk
Grandma, look at me, I'm turnin' the other cheek

Feels like kids and cake mix, can't wait to lick the bowl
But it's a bigger picture, holmes, trust, I done seen it
From Frankfurt to Cologne, Oslo to Sweden
From Italy's Milan to the shores of Napoli
Now I consider Ferrari and Salvador Dalis
I'm no longer local, my thoughts are global
That's why I seem distant, son, expand your vision

Blonde hair and blue eyes, I'm gettin' back with a vengeance
Whip it like they want me all attached to the kitten

I'm sorry, grandmama, for mistakes I have made
When I aired family business, how you put me in my place
Even my baby mama, I can't look you in the face
'Cause I can't do enough, you a symbol of God's grace
So I place you in the flowerbed, porcelain showerhead
Throughout the house and keep the youngins' mouths fed
And when I'm gone, I hope it is said
I gave structure to the youth by the example I led, uh

It's unbelievable, you see my warning gives you big chills
The flow running on BIG's heels
My life after death, BIG ain't get to see how this feels
Third time's the charm, baby
After two classics, another stripe up on my arm baby
It's a blessing to blow a hundred thou' in a recession
With no second guessin'
Ha-ha, we're ballin', drop tops we're floorin'
Champagne we're pourin', Re-Up is the gang and I'm all in
To the powder and the flame I have fallen
Get money, blow money is my calling
Yuugh! Watch a nigga burn through it
Life's a maze, you twist and you turn through it
The driest of droughts, maneuvered and I earned through it
I'm set straight like a perm do it, Push

How you count our money? We ain't even finished counting

It's like stopping a train, nigga think he's stopping my reign
Talk slick while dropping my name?
I'm putting y'all to shame, diamonds in the little hand
50 percent splits, I X out the middleman
A far cry from a stash in the rental van
I'm the reason the hood need a dental plan
Ladies and gentlemen, introducing
The C-4S with the rims protruding
The roof vamoose, like a magic show
Got me looking to the heavens like a javelin throw

Mildew-ish, I heat it, it turns bluish
It cools to a tight wad, the Pyrex is Jewish
I get paper, it seems I get foolish
Take it to Jacob and play ""Which hue's the bluest?""
We ain't browsing, luxurious housing
Pull up so mean with the angel bowing
Or with the emblem bearing the stallion

I make big money, drive big cars
Everybody know me, it's like I'm a movie star
Virginia nights, sellin' hard white
To sellin' out shows, every gangster love my flow
Still, I creep low, thinkin' niggas tryna harm me
Hoping my karma ain't comin' back here to haunt me
Was it that nigga? I took his powder with a smile
Prayin' to Lord the gun ain't pop and hit the child, shit
I peeled niggas' girls back like alpha-hydroxy
Spent money like Happy Days, I'm the real Fonzie
Top off the coupe, that's how JFK got shot, B
Can't let niggas roll up beside me and 2Pac me
Holla if you hear me, tears flowin' sincerely
Check up on my block weekly, my health yearly
Something's wrong with me, niggas don't get along with me
Got a four-four, hope your body got strong kidneys, oh

All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches
Feel like a chuckwagon 'cause I'm on twelve horses
And the three behind mine (Uh), they be the clique
So much ice in they Rollies, they shit don't tick, man
Winter through the summer (What?), care less what it cost me
While I'm shoveling the snow, man, call me Frosty Lover

This for the hundred-thousand dollar kitted German drivers
With big rims and low-pro tires
Fuckin' with college bitches with innocent looks like Mýa
Corrupt they mind, turn 'em to liars, I groom 'em well
Dior whore, Christian Lacroix
Keep guns stashed under the floorboard
Enough to start World War
Paradise in reaches, home next to beaches
Hair pressed, blowin' in the wind, shit 'bout long as Jesus
Hostilely speaks the gospel, so match this
Pusha push John P. Kees with these sounds of crackness, uh
The Black Martha Stewart, let me show you how to do it
Break down pies to pieces, make cocaine quiches, uh
Money piles high as my nieces
Hefty bags full of cash, cars full of ass
Rolex presidential, bitch, feel the glass

Hah, it's that look that astounds
Life's a circus, I parade the six through these clowns
The crown is vacant, I'm takin' the proper steps
I'm takin' them Poppa steps, they prayin' for my downfall
Is it the bling? The king, conquistador
That my jeweler made the face blush on the Franck Muller
The R shape peculiar, it's awesome, laying over dark skin
Lookin' like arson when I park in the left, it's constant
Minute hand is like Parkinson's
You a fish where the sharks a-swim
In that opaque linen with the odd-colored stitching
V12 on the Modena, you can see the pistons
HREs on it, mami, see it glisten
When I— make all of her twist like Dickens
It's feelin' like parts is missin'
Top stole, push soul, gotta drive it like pole position 'til my soul is risen
All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches

Welcome to the world of Rollies
VS diamonds and that fifty-thousand dollar showpiece got me shinin'
First nigga holler, ""Show me""
Let that nine millimeter turn a fella ghostly
Hell, I'll even grant amnesty to those who owe me
You fuckin' faggots, you need to raise your glass and toast me
Niggas can't figure the format for hustler criteria
Not chrome, chrome rims with stallion insignia
Listen, youngin, you've only just begun
""You'll understand when you're older,"" said father to the son
Who would've thought such riches stem from ill rhymes?
Canary yellow diamonds size of yield signs, slow down
And proceed with caution
Carousel of horses with dual exhaustion, 'fess up
Youngin, you'll always be next up
Go against I, forever play catch-up, nigga
All I want to do is ride around shinin' while I can afford it
Plenty ice on my neck, so I don't get nauseous
Float around in the greatest of Porsches

No, no, no
I told you, I lived this shit
I ain't up here just rappin' and tappin'
Spittin' and skittin' and shit
Nah, uh-uh, not me
I'm not you, I'm not you, rapper
I'm not you
Pusha

I keep that Ziploc bustin' at the stitches
Culinary chemist, I serve the malicious
To break the fiends fixes, one give you the sniffles
The other leave you with the itches
Transport airport with the Vaseline
So I can fulfill my dreams of pastures that's green
More cash then ya seen, with an Aston that's green
Me driving up fast with the lean
Zonin' family, keep youngins in them rented Camrys
Door panels full of shit and I ain't full of shit
Reckless-ass, God forbid they don't crash
From the panel to the dash, it's four pounds of slab
Nah, bitch, we don't believe in air bags
Cars turn tricks like them Ringling Brothers skits
Whether bitch hop out, or the Glock pop out
Ya know what I'm about, blow clear ya sinus 'til the snot drop out

Whoever said birds fly south for the winter's a damn lie
Got 'em right here, and if I don't like you, the grams hide
Take it or leave it, soon as a fiend taste it, they need it
Make 'em smoke it right in front of you to make you believe it
Probably think I won't murder you the way I smile
But I'ma take a lot of shots A.I. style
And Jada, the name is filthy, but so what?
The motherfuckin' game is filthy, you know what?
My mom and my pops really did a good job
But it was the Montega and the 'caine that built me
So I could never hate on another brother
God is great, the devil is a motherfucker
When you broke but they think you got money
Crackers start showin' you love, your own people act funny
I tear niggas heads off, I don't discriminate
Waves, cornrows or dreads, I will eliminate

I'm far from a noodle nigga, I stab up block reps
And turn quiet streets into hot sets
Nigga, that's funny, you say you a killer, how?
What is it, the return of the killer clowns?
Akhi, you put no fear in my heart
I make ya people say, ""Wow, that didn't look like my man""
They flipped him upside down, the coroner did what he can
He got hit with ten rounds at point blank and point blank
Coldchain left that nigga stankin'
Nigga have static, to his face, I got the wrinkling, slugs all in it
I had my eyes on his mink and I didn't give 'em a chance to blink
When I jogged up on 'em, pressed the .40 up on him, shocked 'em
Made his head stand on end and like a baby, I rocked 'em
Your coffin's your cradle, you can't bite the hand that made you
That's the beginning of the end, and you a thug that pretends
Call Coldchain ""Super Nigga,"" I got X-Ray vision, I see through men
And squeeze triggers with bullets that go through men
Fuck with S.P., that's ya date with death
Got bullets that'll break ya chest
No sleep like I hate to rest
I'm in the hood like its my fate to rep
I hold it down any place I step
And I love getting slept on
'Cause I'm rawer than dope, fresh out of Africa that never been stepped on
Dawg, I'ma clap at you the minute that you rep wrong
Holiday, the Ghost the main reason why your set gone
Why I love riffing 'em poor? You wouldn't understand
'Cause my God is different than yours
If the world spin in a circle, I want to learn to move backwards
Kill niggas the first minute they jerk you
What you keep the toaster for? Creeping through the hood and
Shit ain't really good, but I'm deeper than the ocean floor
Higher than a plane and meaner than a bull
I want ya insides out, so I mean it when I pull

Rappers is talking to me as if (Come on)
We in the same boat I tell them quick, ""No, I move coke"" (Uh-uh)
And you and I don't share no common bond
So forgive me if I don't receive you with open arms (No)
It shames me to no end
To feed poison to those who could very well be my kin (Uh-huh)
But where there's demand, someone will supply
So I feed them their needs, at the same time, cry
Yes, it pains me to see them need this
All of them lost souls and I'm their Jesus
Deepest regret and sympathy to the streets
I seen 'em pay for they fix when they kids couldn't eat (So sorry)
And with this in mind, I still didn't quit

Straight crushing you

Hello, new world, here we come
On them Twinkie trains with the hood screaming, ""We on our way""
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man, screamin', ""I'm on my way""
Yes, I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by papi, screamin', ""It's on its way""
Can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say, ""Look out, world, I'm on my way""

I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was sixteen, eyes full of hope
Baggin' up grams at the Hyatt, though
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke (Oh)
At the same time, hidin' from mama, dodgin' the drama
Fuckin' plenty bitches while duckin' a baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, Floetry
Say yes, niggas hear the ""yuugh"" and they know it's me
Make 'em sick to they stomach how they supposed to be
Sippin' on a fifty-foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where it's supposed to be
Funny how my neighbors don't think it's where I'm supposed to be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roof's on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting

Who rock Air Nikes, live a hustler's way of life
In white tees, constantly duckin' from D's
Pumpin' that D arm readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin', stay lookin' over they shoulders
Holdin' them boulders, tryin' to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at you, quote-unquote famous rapper
Who turn positive, try to tell you how to live
But this information, I must pass to the homies
If hustlin' is a must, be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine, I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign cars, stick shift, six gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from cryin', visitin'
You behind that glass while you await sentencin'

Just want y'all to know it's 'bout time for us to come up and make a change, man
They keep tryna keep us down
But that ain't the way to be, man
It's 'bout time for us to get it together, man

Why the niggas can't get together, put their money together?

This for players all over the world, this is Grimey

Time's a-wasting, niggas doin' so much hatin'
Free your heart and show your greatness

Just like you, had Satan tryin' my patience
Still, you look at me through jealous eyes

Playas, we ain't the same, I'm into 'caine and guns
Chopard with the fishes make the facelift numb
Out in Panama in that amazing sun
I'm amazing, son, you niggas wonder where my grace is from
I speak with corrupted tongue
Recognized the underworld since I was young
Back in '84 when I saw Crockett and Tubbs as the law
These eyes got big when they televised that raw
My mama should've seen it comin'
Me runnin' up and down the stairs too quick
Hummin' Miami Vice theme music
Calderone made me colder
I see the villain's impact now that I'm older
Ignorant fool, views ignorant, too
Got a lot of money, keep militant tools
Wasn't present the session they handed out the rules
So I gravitated, related to life's cruels
The meaning? Pusha T's more than he's seeming
Not just a rap name, more so like a damn shame
Nothing's changed, just the crimes is less heinous
The three of us know, yet the shooter remains nameless
And I don't even watch my back
I was raw before rap, and I ain't lost my past
Shit could get hairy, I could lose myself in a flash
Niggas'll think I'm Jim Carrey how I off that mask

I even went by the book at first
Until I realized nine-to-five wouldn't quench my thirst, so I
Start my mission, leave my residence
Mama knew that a child like me had better sense
But something had to give, that's real, I had to live
I chef'd that soft white and pumped from her crib
Scout's honor, started with my grandmama
Who distributed yay she had flown in from the Bahamas
Partner, please, I grinds, I hustle with ease
Can damn near eyeball any weight in my sleep
I don't entertain hate surrounding the street
If I was you, I'd be tryna get down with me
But, no, see, these niggas know too much
Meanwhile, I rock jewels that look like my diamonds blush
Cats act as if rap fell in my lap
I've suffered heartbreak many times back-to-back
And still feel belittled, sittin' here spittin' riddles
Amongst clown-ass rappers who tend to give me the giggles
Let 'em take it however they wanna take it
I'm the reason your favorite MC's no longer your favorite
Hey, I'm one of the greats, I can't lie
I mean, great to the point I'm concerned I might die

Lord Heavens, why must I live so devilish?
They say what you do comes back on you two times

Who wants to be a millionaire? Me, and you ain't got no more life lines
You a snitch nigga fighting crime, go ahead and tell the police
'Cause every move you make, I'ma throw a slug

Say, dawg, let's not get involved
You don't wanna tango, I'll dress you in a halo
Cock the gauge, polka dot your braids
Face you with a chrome four that'll lock your legs
And you can't move, I roll big and I can't lose
They watch so hard, ain't nothing I do that ain't news
Carry it like I'm a stranger to the game
I cut short any whisper that endanger my name
I hold toasts on both coasts, not for no joke
I'm known in the streets on the account I know coke
And we got word that the cops watch us
But that don't stop us, we maneuver and move a little more cautious
I hate to think that the dope game is my callin'
'Cause it got us singing lullabies to our fallen
""Goodnight, friend, 'til we meet again
But for now in your name, we re-up and eat again"", uh
I never front like I'm something I'm not
But being broke, well, that's just something I'm not
Y'all talk with hatred, but I live off that
And I lived off cocaine way 'fore I lived off rap
Feel me, friend? If they could, they'd kill me, friend
'Cause I weigh too much, learned not to say too much
They couldn't take me in the CL, that's way too much
And I'm too gone, y'all niggas can talk on (Yeah)
You might also like
They call me Mr. Please-Believe-It, believe it, please
I put the pump in your mouth and help you breath with ease
This guy's in a hurry
Ma, I can't even fuck with you if you ain't in the itinerary
I don't know where dudes is buying they jewelry
Why's your ice cream look like it's made by Ben & Jerry?
Y'all the type of players that be getting two-day contracts
Email snitch, got Ds in your two-way contacts
I'm in the club sippin' on that new 'Ze cognac
In the number 9 Jordans with the deuce trey on back
The Street Family so cool, we could pull bitches
Even if it was July and we had on Woolrich's
I got them Teflons to shove in the four
That have undercovers and po' recovering slow
The government know the kid been loving the dough
Since I was moving white off the curb like shoveling snow, Ghetto

I keep the streets so numb they call me ""Novocain""
I turn over 'caine over and over again
Hell, so much clientele
I could lose it all today, be back the next day
Still up in the same way
As I left ya, all in three gestures, down, up and aim
I can define death better than Webster, wet ya
Now bless ya, and off to my next venture
Blocks so white, June look like December
Wintertime, snow everywhere, flow everywhere
So much dough, I fly my hoes everywhere
Ask 'em, Pusha T push a ton
Push a ton of that shit that makes ya nose run
Yes, I'm holding, whether it's heat or cocaine
In the door panel of my four-wheel motion
Ain't jokin', but I laugh how other flows convince you
With money, it's funny, it's Comedy Central
Mine's mental, others is made up stencil
When I'm on vacation, my babies ride in the rental
I'm livid, they act as if I don't live it
Saran Wrap, Vaseline so they can't sniff it
Yves St. Laurent knitted, shorts Bermuda

You ride for your boy, then anything is yours

Calling Apollo 9, calling Apollo 9
What is your condition, over
Calling NASA, calling NASA
This is Apollo 9, condition green
We've landed on Mars, and all systems are go

Yo, it's three-thousand thirty
I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, hero, not no small feat
It's all heat in this day and age
I'll raid your grave, anything it takes to save the day
Neuromancer, perfect blend of technology and magic
Use my rapping so you all can see the hazards
Plus entertainment where many are brainless
We cultivated a lost art of study and I brought a buddy
Automator, harder slayer, fascinating combinations
Cyber warlords are aggravating abominations
Arm a nation with hatred? We ain't with that
We high-tech archaeologists searching for knick-knacks
Composing musical stimpacks that impacts the soul
Crack the mold of what you think you rapping for
I used to be a mech soldier but I didn't respect orders
I had to step forward, tell them this ain't for us
Living in a post-apocalyptic world morbid and horrid
The secrets of the past they hoarded
Now, we just boarded on a futuristic spacecraft
No mistakes, black, it's our music we must take back

Del, I'm feeling like a ghost in a shell
I wrote this in jail playing host to a cell
For the pure verbal
They said my sentence was equivalent to murder
Just another hurdle, I bounced through a portal
I knew they had the mind state of mere mortals
My ears morphed to receptors that catch your
Every word about gravity control
And the families they hold for handsome ransoms
On the run with a handgun, blast bioforms; I am warned
That a planet-wide manhunt with cannons
Will make me, abandon, my foolish plan of uprisin'
Fuck dyin', I hijack a mech
Control it with my magical chants, so battle advanced
Through centuries of hip-hop legacy, mega speed
Hyperwarp to Automator's crib and light the torch
They can't fight the force
Victory is ours once we strike the source
Enterprisin' wise men look to the horizon
Thinkin' more capitalism is the wisdom
And imprison, all citizens empowered with rhythm
We keep the funk alive by talking with idioms
Yo it's three-thousand thirty
I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator
Yo it's three-thousand thirty
I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator
Yo it's three-thousand thirty
I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator

It's an eternal evil concerned with thievery
Medieval prehistoric rhetoric well we ahead of that
Lay it down with sound waves that pound pavement
Original minstrels my central processing unit
Is in tune with my heart for this art
Not artificial cause that makes it hard to miss you
Copycats finish last in the human race
Staying glued to safes too prude to take a buddha break
We got espers that let us bless with fresh shit
Undetected by yes men
Questing for five fleeting nanoseconds of fame
Protecting the brain from conspiracies against my cosmos
While I flow to Neo-Tokyo with Opio
Or discuss combustible rust clusters with Plus
Evade cyber police in a computer crib confuse the kids
But I can make a kickin' rhyme that's sacred
Telepathic mind that takes his greatness from the Matrix
Esper rhyme professor rushes on colder pressures
With correction measures
While half the world's a desert
Cannibals eat human brains for dessert
Buried under deep dirt, mobility inert
I insert these codes for the cataclysm
Ever since I had the vision use my magnetism
In this modern metropolis that tries to lock us up
Under preposterous laws, it's not for us
Yo, it's three-thousand thirty
I want y'all to meet Deltron Zero, and Automator

Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I want to make a super virus
Strong enough to cause blackouts in every single metropolis
Cause they don't wanna unify us
So fuck—it total anarchy and can't nobody stop us

I create like a heathen
The first cycles of this virus I can send through a modem
Infiltration hits your station
No Microsoft or enhanced DOS will impede
Society thinks they're safe when
Bingo! Hard drive crashes from the rending
A lot of hackers tried viruses before
Vaporize your text like so much white out
I want it where a file replication is a chore

De-cipitate they plans in their face and catch the fever

Even space stations are having a hard time
Peacekeepers seek to take our manhood
Which results in the form of global apartheid
Ghettos are trash dumps with gas pumps
Exploding and burnt out since before the great union
The last punks walk around like masked monks
Ready to manipulate the database or break through 'em
Human rights come in a hundredth place

Traverse and purged, the travesties, that tempts your ear holes

My flow is like, liquid oxygen, rip it often with
Specific impulse, increase the thrust, grease the cuts
Unleash a cluster of thoughts, I muster
I talk to touch ya', and rupture commercial communications
Convert solar-energy, into imagery
In the minds eye, blind side the contagious
With radioactive isotopes, to decay them
Atomic mass, they small as fragments

In the year three thousand and thirty everybody wants to be an MC
In the year three thousand and thirty everybody want to be a DJ
In the year three thousand and thirty everybody want to be a producer
In the year three thousand and thirty
Everybody want to tell ya the meaning of the music

I must appeal to you people with your faculties
'cause everybody else is gonna laugh at me
People try to get over and take a crack at me
The universe is one and I can see what rap can be glorious
Put in the Smithsonian my podiums for holy hymns
But you see who's controlling them
Fuck myself off 'cause of the egotistical mode I'm in
No I can't slap you no five
When you and your cutty is talkin' shit about me outside
People take pride in what they have no hand in
Sorta like a phantom holographic handsome
But deep inside he want to do what his man done
Just because his peers jeer and and clown
When you're six feet deep no one hears you now
They say were not compatible like deers and cows and owls
So many rules and regulations say you're not allowed

I'm caught in the grip of the city

Someone that Del's against, opposite or positive
When I drop the law against nature be faithful
Why should I hate you we ain't that different
We may act different in some ways
But we still grouped together like a fuckin' survey
Sufferin' and fuck em all's the motto
I'm trapped in a bottle
My music's gettin' hollow
And that's what happens when humanity you follow
Where every leak or info is hard to swallow
Sell your Marlboros and car insurance
Put niggas on the moon and can't pay for your burdens
I smoke herb and rock a turban
Meditate on the world and whats occurrin'
A lot of white boys like the style and copy
Dig in something deeper and you'll peep that we're not free

To bring it to a close as if life is their role, their path
When all paths are intersections

And to some it's bad luck
I believe you held something back for too long
It grew strong
And energy got its own will
And people think they make music still
When music is there with out you or me we just manipulate
For better or worse so let it situate
I get to make records and dough
Paid out the asshole
And still seen as another face on the totem pole
Conquer, my sponsors are monsters
And everybody thinks that I'm on one
I'm glad I love music and life
'Cause it's easy to see the pain and strife and end it all tonight

I'm caught in the grip of the city

Transmutation, brand new statements
I'll have you gapin' open
Check it out y'all

Now let's see—Deltron Z
Art avenger, let's start the adventure
Hit ya with nerve gas, absurd blasts
Crashin spacecraft, I'm bio-enhanced
Hiero advanced series, monstrous evolution
Headed, tooth and nail, scoop the trail
Super-sleuth, a new race
Mad creator, savage nature
World Wide Web, the ebb and flow
Light years from watchful eyes while my thoughts provide
Objectives to ostracize the pompous prophecies
Underground societies are hard to lead
Asteroid surfing, castor-oil burping
The darkest side of humanity animated
The grand awakening, plan to take it in
I demand your patronage, mobilize my battletanks
With clusters small, NTR's to empty Mars
Many MC's cruise low earth orbit
Easier for me to use my search warrant
Drift by a star, absorb it, and store it
Leave Taurus porous, my galaxy's gorgeous
Quantum jump, I'm right at your doorstep

Enthuse your phalanx with my literary talents
Just a bit of balance, rip the silence
In space, all-star systems are our victims
Atomics, synonymous with ominous
Implications of information, or information, and entertainment
Cyber-tech dialect, you gotta earn my respect
I'm like Gamera to amateurs, hit em with a cannonball
And in all this confusion
The fusion of music and mind precipitates translucent illusions
Search the ruins with Automator
Hit the walls with a carbonator
Hit-or-missiles, just regenerate
The sonic soldiers allow us to demonstrate
Emergency dispatch, skyscrapers ripped back
From the impact, their flow is mismatched
My style's protected by heat shields and ceramics
Don't panic, I landed on planet Mercury
Gave it atmosphere, set up my headquarters
I'll never get captured here
Rap your tear clap your ear with Soulsonic Mantronik phonics
Turn your brain to an omelette

Take a space shuttle to escape trouble

Yeah, that's the funky-funky shit
Aye, bust it, yo, yo

Deltron; tremendous force to end your course
Every whim is enforced
I send men with torches to raid your fortress
And in the process radiate your optics
Subconsciously haunt emcees
Super human technician atomic inner dimension
Too mental with intuition
Typographical aptitude let my lasers clap at you
Mapped the route, psychologically crappin out, what you laughing
'bout?
Imitations, getting penetrated in 3D simulation
In my emcee training class remain in mass
Never get liquidated convert energy
Into matter instantly with a pen and pad
Calculate the centigrade, heat the center of gravity
Abolish apathy graphically packing 380's
With body heat sensitive bullets you need safety
Vest on your face and neck
Mental armory levitate legs for my monarchy
No malarkey my flows embarking
Psionically sparking brain cells 'til they're sparkling

I remake my universe every time I use a verse
To fulfill my destiny, emcees rest in peace
Side barriers provide care within
From impurities every word will seize your attention like third degree
I subjugate you other fake performers while the bass of your face
No sentient being attempts fleein'
Emcees siphon my likeness
Biting my insights like five enchiladas
This plane of existence is amazingly different
From my orbital oratory always going for the glory
You pop wide open from my sly slogans
I stay in effect with alien tech
Make you wanna say he's the best
With synchronization with commendation
It's armor plated hard to fake it
Never carbonated, scar your matrix
Virtually uncertainty, murk your mediocre sheets and sofa
With my style of energy, Del assembling
A realm where anything, is possible
NASA scientists can't define this
Mechanical mind set diamond alignment
No one knows the time, pass me by
No one knows the time, pass me by

Mathematical astro-grapple a flow, pterodactyl
Very factual crash course, last resort, cast me off
At last we warp
To my own world, my own neurological cubbyhole
Open the air shaft I'll be there fast
With spare raps to tear back their mass
Deltron experimental critical literal
Professor test the pitiful
Micronautalyst interchangeable
All of this gamma grammar far from Bamma'
Got mind control bandannas
To control your clan with scanners
Brand the planet like a band of bandits
Who man the cannons and guns with random
Subatomic, love of logic, bug with phonics
Tub of chronic low in bridle with controlling ciphers
Unraveling rhyme, in traveling time
Alien life form mail in a pipe bomb
Deltoid life long I write songs
Monarch absolute, serve a glass of proof
When I vanish leave my spirit in a planet
On top of the surface my words and wit emerging
No one knows the time, pass me by
No one knows the time, pass me by

Hey time for you to upgrade, fuck save, time to load
All my rhymes the soul, and find your own
Salivate over what I collaborate, with high tech wizardry
And breathe new life into the industry

Hey, I reduce the gain, when I boost my brain

With psychotropics to optimize my profits
Envelop you with development kits that help me
To embellish the elements dynamic and too intelligent

I feel like returnin' to Earth and burnin' some herb
I'm sick of lookin' at the inside of space stations
Time for Deltron to take a vacation
My expertise in aviation got us to our destination (where?)
The East Bay
My living quarters is completely froze solid
I thaw it out with a heat ray
Now I'm chillin' in a sauna, pulsating jet streams
Peeping out in virtual reality my wet dreams
Perusing my 21st century classic comics, the fun is astronomic
(Ha-ha-ha...)
I figured since I'm here I'll renew my galactic passport
So I'm not persecuted by no galactic assholes

And how I dodge man-hunts and security cameras
Avoided apprehension in subatomic dimensions
And even more impressive 'cause of what we live in

Interplanetary adversaries battling for supremacy
Sounds like a good way to build up my infamy
Soon as Automator sent for me
We headed over to receive our registration forms
From the galactic embassy
(Yes, may I help you?)
Remember me?
To escape a global panic we had to intercede
(Oh, you're here for the battle forms?)
Yeah can we get them for free
(I'm afraid not, you'll have to pay the entry fee)
It was worth a try when we first arrived on Mercury
Gravity adjustment was a must then
Step up contestant number 12
I was 13, he started bursting ammunition that wasn't working
His rudimentary technical abilities couldn't kill me
Knocked me for a loop
But I can still breathe
He had the crowd going by appearance
Then comes the anticipated interference from his squad of guards
I bust back with an onslaught of Hydrothermal clod
That burn their third eye
Though outnumbered I come with heat
And trigger a massive explosion to the beat
They hit me with compressed air
Left my chest bare
My sonic stun gun takes em out by the next snare

Atmosphere methane be strategic like a chess game
Leaves this MC with chest pains
I had to battle a shadow in his black life form
He dazzled me, addin' three points to his score
Engulfed my microphone with darkness, added three more
The panel started to roar
I had to find the core of his power
He stretched his text causing me to blackout
It took my DAT out
I couldn't back out
It took out the sound man, I'm taking a pounding
I bust out a acapella, that's astounding
Project a unibeam through his spleen
Pulled out my x-ray cannons to disintegrate the phantom
It's not finite cell structure ruptured
His form will get all bust up into clusters
Shadowy masses spread to the greater darkness of outer space
Now I'm placed first among artists
Serve dude, more space travel

What have you?
Next destination?
The colony of Sicilia: an Earth colony
Oh, this is appealing

With mic in place we was off breathing frost
In the void thinking what if we had lost?
Ha, entertain an ignorant thought
Land Ho, Sicilia we entered the port
Fill out a few forms then we meet our challenger named Quzar
No matter who you are I'll handle ya
He's a real charmer
I threw on my plasteel armour
He wants to absorb the talents that I worked so hard for
A biter hard core
I busted a few shots and opened him like a car door
He was a quadruped, four arms
He hit me with four forearms made of bronze
I said Automator play the song
(You got it)
It was the theme
Made a slight alteration in my skin
Set him up with a cognition beam with his double team
Leaned toward his dome piece and reamed the back of his neck
With a cranial disruption siphon
Squeezed out his brain like juice

Til you broke through when nobody was looking
Do you remember? Not to get into nostalgia
But some of those things had value

How did it happen? An independent corporation
With no control could maintain it
With rebellious force, developed a course of action
We advertise, inviting all to court, the massive
A queen's faithful hand, maidens born to wealthy parents
A life of luxury, but full of scorn, yeah, they be jealous
We were omnivores, gathered food with our tongues

Produces electric shock if you try to escape the bond
High voltage prods are used to control the eyes
Renew a process, erase memories of all
Like guidance and calmness suggested a new society
Unrelated to criminal acts of the high and mighty
Oppressors who contest our every motion
Controlling our emotions through hyperactive convulsions

All resources available in large quantities
Before the deceit and greed and privatization
Of everything that society placed inside it
Spaces as a service to the patrons
Now you pay for it and your credit better be good
Or if there's an emergency, never see afoot
Extended in your direction to help forget it
Shred any evidence of wrongdoing to make pledges
Among secret societies with freaky fetishes
Lie about what's really inside, they never let us in

Even the President got his hand in the contraband
They done control the band of information
Leading to education to a brainwaves pulsatin'
They said ""Fuck the Environment!""
For so long the environment said ""Fuck y'all""
Ok, now we in a cobra clutch
Once the planet fold up, and blow up
You know what?
Mother Nature must've saved us cause look
We still stayed here
But much was lost
We lost touch with the source

Everybody, call it a scramble
Full scale chaos, reckless abandon

Follow your commander, though you can't stand him
No plannin', wild and dangerous
Anger just permeate, so we learn to take
Hostility with a grain of salt
And step out the way, cause it ain't our fault
Bank vaults blown to smithereens
Whatever's left is left for the fiends
But you'd better not mess with the team

By the average trench coat
Pulling out so you get smoked
Blahhh
Like hickory sausage
Victory? Come on, it's far from flawless
They ain't God, but their ways is pompous
Thinking they can stomp us with troops and contras
But just let loose a stupid
Monster, unable to be contained
It's too late, they launched it
With no promotion
So now we revolt
And insult they sultan
With explosive voltage

Underneath the Statue of Liberty's remains

Divide and rule

Countdown to visitation
Inner spaces
Invaded, some say by alien races
They orbit our sun for thousands of years
Creating supersonic wind tunnels that funnel severe
Take-off weight
So aircrafts that pass the range
Become sacrificed in a mass of flames
Atmospheric oscillations cause extreme accelerations
The physical damage could devastate the
Electrical, chemical, biological surfaces
Smuggled by the government's officials to customers
Moving airstreams would cause ionization
Cosmic rays would then expose you to radiation
All this plays a part in the great invasion
A rectangular equation your game awakening
We land our plane on the plains of the land that (struck?)
Formulating the plan to stick
Oh, there's a chance for it

I'm gliding through the atoms
What is this loneliness I'm feeling?
It's all in your head
This loneliness I'm feeling
You might also like
No need for panic, proceed with planning
Soon as they landed, blown off the planet
Aquatic space vessels flow like a wet dream
Conductor of the thought train, I authored a jet stream
When Mother Nature got out of line with Father Time
She was visited, now we gotta live with it
Reptilian amphibious man
Cause you kept chilling and
Just missed the plan
We unified humans, aliens, rebels
The earth's desert, sandstorms, and dust devils
There's no high-roll fallacy
The most glamorate conglamorous in this spiral galaxy
The possibility of extraterrestrial contact was all fact
Humans were the first stage of attack
Meant to further mutate to creatures named Zolanoids
Travelled to the earth before the legionaries were destroyed

I'm gliding through the atoms
What is this loneliness I'm feeling?
It's all in your head
This loneliness I'm feeling

The forerunners' structure was dug up from
The rim of the Milky Way galaxy systematically
Empires collapsed from higher a tax
I admire the aspiring acts
That my eyes were infatuated with final conflict
Interstellar civilizations came along with bombs and ships
Machines with artificial intelligence telling us our existence is not relevant
Damn
Who would volunteer
To bounce extremely low frequency rhymes off the ionosphere
Tell all alien life I'm in here
So your vessel? It could get commandeered
Like your planet
Cause you taking it for granted
And everyone ran when they landed
There's a pentagon inside every pentagram
Do your geometry
It's in the center fam
I'm gliding through the atoms
What is this loneliness I'm feeling?
It's all in your head
This loneliness I'm feeling

Look at all that bullshit going on down there in the street

We gotta go to some island
Grab your shopping cart, grab your cane
Let's get the heck out of here
We gotta move closer to the equator
When are they gonna start showing those Mr. T re-runs?

""Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings""
""But I'm only going to get this one chance"" (Six minutes—, six minutes—)
""Something's wrong, I can feel it"" (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on!)
""Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what. 
If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble; 
And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances""
""You are just what the doc ordered""

I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rap-bot
But for me to rap like a computer it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time, I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Only realized it was ironic, I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
It's actually disastrously bad for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpièce

'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like Ι have got

Well, to be truthful the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
Did nothing but shoot for the Moon since (Pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme""
Now I lead a new school full of students
Me? I'm a product of Rakim
Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position
To meet Run–D.M.C., and induct them
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
On the wall of shame
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy
So gay I can barely say it with a straight face, lookin' boy (Ha-ha!)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur
Like you're watching a church gathering take place, lookin' boy
""Oy vey, that boy's gay!""—that's all they say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy!
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause—
I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod
This planet's Krypton—no, Asgard, Asgard

So you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off, then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head, a zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle
We have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good at least once in a while
So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
To maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines
Just in case 'cause even you unsigned
Rappers are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I
Was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine
You get too big and here they come tryin'
To censor you like that one line
I said on ""I'm Back"" from The Mathers LP 1 when I
Tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a 9
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for
You're pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck being normal!
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!""
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music
""Oh, he's too mainstream.""
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
""It's not hip-hop, it's pop,""—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it
""I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use.""
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
And I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you
I'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel
I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still ""Chunky but Funky""
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling
Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient
And more sympathetic to the situation
And understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?
Don't mistake him for Satan
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard—be a king? Think not
Why be a king when you can be a god?6.8KEmbed",https://images.genius.com/37f958ab28031af87d13b5d224749878.533x533x1.jpg

Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant
He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody
Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged

Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-
Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me
To the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not
This may be the only opportunity that I got

Rihanna just hit me on a text
Last night I left hickeys on her neck
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack
Was watchin' 8 Mile on my NordicTrack
Realized I forgot to call you back
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap
Stan, Stan, son
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad
But how you gonna name yourself after a damn gun
And have a man-bun?
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable
Supplyin' smoke, got the fire stoked
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze
Your reply got the crowd yelling, ""Woo!""
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who
With your corny lines (""Slim, you're old"")—ow, Kelly, ooh
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you
By 29, I had three albums that had blew
Now let's talk about somethin' I don't really do
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin' food
But you're a fuckin' mole hill
Now I'ma make a mountain out of you, woo!
Ho, chill, actin' like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow
Gunner? Bitch, you ain't a bow and arrow
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill, sprayin' lead (Brrt)

Are you eating cereal or oatmeal?
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk? Wheaties or Cheerios?
'Cause I'm takin' a shit in 'em, Kelly, I need reading material

""Yo, Slim, your last four albums sucked
Go back to Recovery,"" oh shoot, that was three albums ago
What do you know? Oops
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof
Luxury, oh, you broke, bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02
To burn it in front of you, ho
Younger me? No, you the wack me, it's funny but so true
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you
'Til I'm hitting old age
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddy, go play
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day
Shootin' a video just to fuckin' dig your own grave
Got you at your own wake, I'm the billy goat
You ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay
Next to Taylor Swift and that Iggy ho, you about to really blow
Kelly, they'll be putting your name
Next to Ja, next to Benzino—die, motherfucker!
Like the last motherfucker sayin' Hailie in vain
Alien brain, you Satanist (Yeah)
My biggest flops are your greatest hits
The game's mine again and ain't nothin' changed but the locks
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade a kiss
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this (The fuck?)
Bein' rich-shamed by some prick usin' my name for clickbait
In a state of bliss 'cause I said his goddamn name
Now I gotta cock back, aim
Yeah, bitch, pop Champagne to this! (Pop)
It's your moment
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it
Had to give you a career to destroy it
Lethal injection
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort
But if I was three-foot-eleven
You'd look up to me, and for the record
You would suck a dick to fuckin' be me for a second
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel
Give your life to be as solidified
This mothafuckin' shit is like Rambo when he's out of bullets
So what good is a fuckin' machine gun when it's outta ammo?
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper
How the fuck can him and I battle?
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel
I'll give him my sandals
'Cause he knows, long as I'm Shady he's gon' have to live in my shadow
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring
Lick a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see
You're fuckin' salty
'Cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey
Your red sweater, your black leather
You dress better, I rap better
That a death threat or a love letter?
Little white toothpick
Thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you, prick
Thanks for dissing me
Now I had an excuse on the mic to write ""Not Alike""
But really I don't care who's in the right
But you're losin' the fight you picked
Who else want it? Kells—attempt fails! Budden—L's!
Fuckin' nails in these coffins as soft as Cottonelle
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills
But, Kells, the day you put out a hit's the day Diddy admits
That he put the hit out that got Pac killed, ah!
I'm sick of you bein' wack
And still usin' that mothafuckin' Auto-Tune
So let's talk about it (Let's talk about it)
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth
Need to get the cock up out it
Before we can even talk about it (Talk about it)
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings
Just 'cause you look in the mirror and think
That you're Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers)
Don't mean you are, and you're not about it
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it

Ugh, you're a monster

I can swallow a bottle of alcohol and I'll feel like Godzilla
Better hit the deck like the card dealer
My whole squad's in here, walking around the party
A cross between a zombie apocalypse and B-Bobby ""The
Brain"" Heenan which is probably the
Same reason I wrestle with mania
Shady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up
Consider it to cross me a costly mistake
If they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia
ADHD, Hydroxycut
Pass the Courvoisier (Hey, hey)
In AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate
Better vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday (Ayy)
This beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A
Laughing all the way to the bank, I spray flames
They cannot tame or placate the

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet

I'm just a product of Slick Rick and Onyx, told 'em lick the balls
Had 'em just appalled, did so many things that pissed 'em off
It's impossible to list 'em all
And in the midst of all this
I'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball
Tryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?
Risperdal, voices whisper
My fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn
This is just the song to go ballistic on
You just pulled a pistol on the guy with a missile launcher
I'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological
Quick to tell a bitch screw off like a fifth of vodka
When you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a

Monster
You get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)
I'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)
When the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers
I look like a villain outta those blockbusters
Godzilla, fire spitter, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
Fire, Godzilla, fire, monster
Blood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet
If you never gave a damn (Ayy), raise your hand
'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans
I'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is
The motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)
How can I have all these fans and perspire?
Like a liar's pants, I'm on fire
And I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire
These chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flyer
I got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers
And what goes around comes around just like the blades on the chainsaw
'Cause I caught the flack, but my dollars stacked right off the bat like a baseball
Like Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy
'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)
Bitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher
Won't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care
But I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her
Face in my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez
Cristhian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well
So they wanna give me the chair
Like a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Hari Kari
'Cause e'ry Tom and Dick and Harry carry a Merriam motherfuckin' dictionary on 'em
Swearing up and down they can spit, this shit's hilarious
It's time to put these bitches in the obituary column
We wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem
Get the shaft like a steering column (Monster)
Trigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink
Evil half of the Bad Meets
Evil, that means take a back seat
Take it back to Fat Beats with a maxi single
Look at my rap sheet, what attracts these people
Is my 'Gangsta Bitch' like Apache with a catchy jingle
I stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto
Fill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em
Other words, I Minute Maid 'em
I don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage
I'm murderin' again, nobody will evade
I'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake
Obliterating everything, incinerate a renegade
I'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid
But don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill
I'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla
You're bringin' the killer within me outta me
You don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me
And be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be
Every bit of me's the epitome of a spitter
When I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck
Or you finna be dead the minute you run into me
A hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me
I'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable
You wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable
I'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable
I'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full

Round the outside, round the outside

Round the outside, round the outside
Woo! (Ooh, ooh)

I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie!)

So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy

I said this looks like a job for me

'Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, ""Attention, please""
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me

A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene (Yeah)
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey!)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now, this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

So everybody, just follow me

May I have your attention, please?
May I have your attention, please?
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
I repeat
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?
We're gonna have a problem here

Y'all act like you never seen a white person before
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door
And started whoopin' her ass worse than before
They first were divorced, throwin' her over furniture (Agh!)
It's the return of the ""Oh, wait, no way, you're kidding
He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?""
And Dr. Dre said
Nothing, you idiots, Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement (Ha-ha!)
Feminist women love Eminem
""Chicka-chicka-chicka, Slim Shady, I'm sick of him
Look at him, walkin' around, grabbin' his you-know-what
Flippin' the you-know-who"", ""Yeah, but he's so cute though""
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose
But no worse than what's goin' on in your parents' bedrooms
Sometimes I wanna get on TV and just let loose
But can't, but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose
""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips""
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is
Of course, they're gonna know what intercourse is
By the time they hit fourth grade they've got the Discovery Channel, don't they?
We ain't nothin' but mammals
Well, some of us cannibals who cut other people open like cantaloupes
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes
Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote
Women, wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus, and it goes

I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records (Nope)
Well, I do, so fuck him, and fuck you too
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me
""But Slim, what if you win? Wouldn't it be weird?""
Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here?
So you can sit me here next to Britney Spears?
Yo, shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs
So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst
And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first
Little bitch put me on blast on MTV
""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee""
I should download her audio on MP3
And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD (Agh!)
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me
So I have been sent here to destroy you
And there's a million of us just like me
Who cuss like me, who just don't give a fuck like me
Who dress like me, walk, talk and act like me
And just might be the next best thing, but not quite me
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?

I'm like a head trip to listen to 'cause I'm only givin' you
Things you joke about with your friends inside your livin' room
The only difference is I got the balls to say it in front of y'all
And I don't gotta be false or sugarcoat it at all
I just get on the mic and spit it
And whether you like to admit it (Err), I just shit it
Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can
Then you wonder: ""How can kids eat up these albums like Valiums?""
It's funny, 'cause at the rate I'm goin', when I'm thirty
I'll be the only person in the nursin' home flirting
Pinchin' nurse's asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens
And I'm jerking, but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin'
He could be working at Burger King, spittin' on your onion rings (Ch, puh)
Or in the parkin' lot, circling, screaming, ""I don't give a fuck!""
With his windows down and his system up
So will the real Shady please stand up
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control
And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?
I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady
All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating
So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up
Please stand up, please stand up?
'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes, I'm the real Shady

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up

My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, fuck it, what's been up, man? How's your daughter?
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her? I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold for you, for four hours, and you just said, ""no""
That's pretty shitty, man, you're like his fuckin' idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver? You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
'Cause I don't really got shit else, so that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan—P.S. We should be together too
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad
Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-to-Call-or-Write-My-Fans
This'll be the last package I ever send your ass
It's been six months, and still no word—I don't deserve it?
I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect
So this is my cassette I'm sendin' you, I hope you hear it
I'm in the car right now, I'm doin' ninety on the freeway
Hey, Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
You know the song by Phil Collins, ""In the Air of the Night""
About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin'
But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
That's kinda how this is: you coulda rescued me from drownin'
Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now—I'm drowsy
And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
I loved you, Slim, we coulda been together—think about it!
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it
And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
See, Slim—shut up, bitch! I'm tryin' to talk
Hey, Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk
But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up—see? I ain't like you
'Cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now
Oh, shit, I forgot—how am I supposed to send this shit out?!
My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I
Got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad

Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I just been busy
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
And here's an autograph for your brother; I wrote it on a Starter cap
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must've missed you
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
I say that shit just clownin', dawg, come on, how fucked up is you?
You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin'
To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
Or maybe you just need to treat her better
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine
If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
And had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid
And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
Come to think about it, his name was—it was you

I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
For wantin' my cake, and eat it too, and wantin' it both ways
Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated
When I blew, see, but it was confusing
'Cause all I wanted to do's be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
Whoo! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee!
But with what I gave up to get it was bittersweet
It was like winnin' a used mink
Ironic 'cause I think I'm gettin' so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin' to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep
Goin' coo-coo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think, 'cause I'm—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath

Yeah, ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin' your mind, the way it wanders
(New-ooh, ooh-ooh) Yodel-odel-ay-hee-hoo!
I think it went wanderin' off down yonder
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen
'Cause I need an interventionist
To intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself and all this conflict
'Cause the very thing that I love's killin' me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin' me in the head, keep knockin'
Nobody's home, I'm sleepwalkin'
I'm just relayin' what the voice in my head's sayin'
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the—
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
Well, that's nothin'
(New-ooh, ooh-ooh)

(New-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Well, that's nothin'
(New-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(New-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(New-ooh, ooh-ooh)
(New-ooh, ooh-ooh)

Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that
I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then, drums get killed and
I'm comin' straight at MCs, blood gets spilled and
I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
And shit to say back to the kids who played him
I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
But if one kid out of a hundred million
Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great
It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back
In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that
Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack
Maybe I need a straightjacket
Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that
It's nothin', I'm still friends with the
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed

Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it
I don't take back what I say, if I said it, then I meant it
All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it
I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules
I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food (Yeah)
Pass the plate (Yeah), where my drink (Hol' up)?
This my day (Yeah, yeah), lucky you, fuck you too, woo!

Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot
Y'all gotta move (Boom, bap), y'all gotta move (Woo!), give me the juice

Back on my bullshit, my back to the wall
Turn my back on you, all of you finished (Bap, bop, bop)
Back to these bullets, it's back to the job
Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'
These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin' (Yuh)
You might'a went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
I'm actually buzzin' this time
Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine
I do not fuck with you guys (Woo!)
If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time (Yeah!)
I ain't no gangster, but I got some bangers
Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree
My Twelve Days of Christmas was nothin' but lies (I)
Run at you hard like a sumo (Sumo)
They say I talk like a chulo (Chulo!)
I live on Mars, I'm not Bruno (Woo!)
Bitch, I'm a dog, call me Cujo (Rah)
You play your cards, I reverse on you all
And I might just draw four like a Uno (Bup)
Cállate boca mejor, maricón
Little puto, and all of you culo (Joyner)
They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now (Yeah, yeah)
Shit get relevant 'til all the beef die down (Yeah)
In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down (Bop, bop)
I've been alone and I never needed nobody
Just only me and my shawty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down
Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle
I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now (Woo! Woo!)
I said ain't no love for the other side
Or anyone who ever want smoke (Joyner)
When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope (Yeah)
You in the wrong cab, down the wrong path
Nigga, wrong way, wrong road (Woo! Woo!)
Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower (Vroom!)
You might also like
I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it
This is payback in a way (Yeah), I regret it that I did it
I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em (Ah)
Wasn't in it for the trophies (Nah), just the fuckin' recognition
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules
Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose
I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full
I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think? (Woo!)

I got a couple of mansions
Still, I don't have any manners
You got a couple of ghostwriters
But to these kids, it don't actually matter
They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?""
I said, ""I don't have any answers""
'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
It hurt me like hell, but I'm back on these rappers (Yeah)
And actually comin' from humble beginnings
I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!
We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!""
But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me
The inability to pen humility
Ha-ta-ta, ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of
Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up
Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
About the ones that were here before you that made rap (Yeah)
Let's recap, way back, MC's that (What?)
Wreak havoc on tape decks (Woo)
ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?
We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap
I don't hate trap (Nah), and I don't wanna seem mad
But in fact (Yeah), where the old me at? The same cat
That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that
But I think it's inevitable they know what button to press
Or what lever to pull to give me to snap though (Lil' bitch)
And if I pay it attention, I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
But you've been takin' ya dicks and I'm fuckin' back, ho (Get it?)
On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'
Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
I'm asleep at the wheel again, as I begin to thinkin' about an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again
'Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way
I got spite inside my DNA (Yeah)
But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm working tirelessly, ayy
It's the moment y'all been waitin' for like California
Wishin' rain to pour in that drought, y'all
Been prayin' for my downfall (Yeah)
From the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
Still the same Marshall, that outlaw
That they say as a writer might've fell off
I'm back on that bull like the cowboys
So y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move, yeah, y'all gotta move
Give me some room (Woo!), give me some room (Hey!), give me the juice
Hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out the coupe (Joyner!), hop out and shoot

Yeah
I know sometimes
Things may not always make sense to you right now
But hey
What Daddy always tell you?
Straighten up, little soldier
Stiffen up that upper lip
What you cryin' about?
You got me

Hailie, I know you miss your Mom, and I know you miss your Dad
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry
'Cause you're scared, I ain't there, Daddy's wit' you in your prayers
No more cryin', wipe them tears, Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Lainie, Uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it
We're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'
Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
You might also like
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

Heh, it's funny
I remember back one year when Daddy had no money
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying
'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
And at the time, every house that we lived in
Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
And your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar
Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot
So Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment
And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
And met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me
But Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me
Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV
And Mama didn't like it
And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
Papa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
Now I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here
Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?
Shh! Mama's only gone for the moment
Now hush, little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
I know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise Mama's gon' be alright

And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird
I'ma give you the world
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you
I'll do anything for you to see you smile
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
I'ma break that birdie's neck
I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
And make him eat every karat, don't fuck with Dad! (Haha)406Embed",https://images.genius.com/37f958ab28031af87d13b5d224749878.533x533x1.jpg

*Plane crash*
Yeah (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now
Yeah
Let me explain just how to make greatness
Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout
To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows
If I press the issue just to get the anger out (Brrr!)
Full magazine could take Staples out
Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch
I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'
My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are
To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion of you
You mention me, millions of views, attention in news
I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you
Billions of views, your ten cents are two
Skim through the music to give shit reviews
To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do
Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though
Not even dissin', it just ain't for me
All I am simply is just an emcee
Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea (Get it?)
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably
Shake the world up if it were up to me
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill
I should eat a pill, probably I will
Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (""Evil"" spelled)
Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip
Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench
While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
Like Vice President Mike Pence
Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
Jesus Christ, man, how many times is
Someone gonna fuck on my bitch? (Fuck my side chick!)
You won't ever see Em icy
But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze
And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick (Yeah)
Turn down for what?
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up (Illa, Illa, Illa)
'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks
You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck
Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
And now he wants to take it out on us"" (Ooouuu)
But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me (Ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (NFing)
So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name
I'm fed up with bein' humble
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings
I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to
What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
And you woulda bought it
But sayin' I no longer got it
'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it
'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest (Illa, Illa, Illa)
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
With a bottle full of malt liquor
But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
I don't see why y'all even started with me
I get in beefs, my enemies die
I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
I'm east side, never be caught slippin'
Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats
I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage
The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!""
Shout to all my colorblind people
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink
""Dawg, that's a date"" — ""Looks like an olive to me""
""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!""
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang
Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say
Give me Donkey of the Day
What a way for 2018 to get underway
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch! (Yeah)
Invite 'em in like a One A Day
I'm not done (Preach!)
'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?
'Cause the way I see people turning's
Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose
I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word
Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
Or still yet to be determined?
'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
Sold the dream to that he's deserted
But I think it's workin'
These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
And he's too scurred to answer me with words
'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
But I know at least he's heard it
'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists""
But my beef is more media journalists
(Hold up, hold up, hold up)
I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist
Can get a mouthful of flesh
And yes, I mean eating a penis
'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
So I've been givin' the media fingers
Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
But I just took this beat to the cleanersYou might also like736Embed",https://images.genius.com/37f958ab28031af87d13b5d224749878.533x533x1.jpg

I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed

When it talks to you like you don't belong
Or tells you you're in the wrong field
When something's in your mitochondrial
'Cause it latched on to you, like—

Knock knock, let the devil in

Bedridden, shoulda been dead a long time ago
Liquid Tylenol, gelatins, think my skeleton's meltin'
Wicked, I get all high when I think I've smelled the scent
Of elephant manure—hell, I meant Kahlúa
Screw it, to hell with it, I went through hell with accelerants
And blew up my-my-myself again
Volkswagen, tailspin, bucket matches my pale skin
Mayo and went from Hellmann's and being rail thin
Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik
How can I be down? Me and Bizarre in Florida
Proof's room slept on the floor of 'da motel then
Dr. Dre said, ""Hell yeah!""
And I got his stamp like a postcard, word to Mel-Man

Then paint thinner, then drank 'til I faint
And awake with a headache
And I take anything in rectangular shape
Then I wait to face the demons I'm bonded to
'Cause they're chasin' me but I'm part of you
So escapin' me is impossible
I latch onto you like a—parasite
And I probably ruined your parents' life
And your childhood too
'Cause if I'm the music that y'all grew up on
I'm responsible for you retarded fools
I'm the super villain Dad and Mom was losin' their marbles to
You marvel that? Eddie Brock is you
And I'm the suit, so call me—

Nate Dogg (Svensk Översättning)’Till I Collapse Lyrics
'Cause sometimes you just feel tired
Yo, left, yo, left
Feel weak and when you feel weak
Yo, left, right, left
You feel like you wanna just give up
Yo, left, yo, left
But you gotta search within you
Yo, left, right, left
Try to find that inner strength and just pull that shit out of you
Yo, left, yo, left
And get that motivation to not give up
Yo, left, right, left
And not be a quitter, no matter how bad
Yo, left, yo, left
You wanna just fall flat on your face and collapse
Yo, left, right, left

'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em
'Til the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin' 'em
'Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pennin' 'em
And I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin' 'em?
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom
Adrenaline shots of penicillin could not get the illin' to stop
Amoxicillin's just not real enough
The criminal, cop-killin', hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners
You're comin' with me, feel it or not
You're gonna fear it like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin' up?
Fa' shizzle, my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck

'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(Until the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Give out from underneath me)

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
Tryna hold on to it, 'cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes: Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(Until the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Give out from underneath me)

Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
And it's absurd how people hang on every word
I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
(Until the roof, until the roof)
'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
(The roof comes off, the roof comes off)
'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
(Until my legs, until my legs)
I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
(Give out from underneath me)

Until the roof, until the roof
The roof comes off, the roof comes off
Until my legs, until my legs
Give out from underneath me
I, I will not fall, I will stand tall

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne""
After the first night, but tonight I am
You might also like
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

My name's (Ooh), my name's (Ooh)
River (Ooh), river run
Call me (Ooh), call me (Ooh)
River (Ooh), we'll let the river run

Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!""
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one (I'm sorry)
I don't want to admit to something (I fucked up)
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain

'Cause I know you want me, baby, I think I want you too
I think I love you, baby, I think I love you too (Oh-ooh)
I'm here to save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
I wanna grow together, let's let our love unfurl
You know you want me, baby, you know I want you too
They call me Superman, I'm here to rescue you
I wanna save you, girl, come be in Shady's world (Ooh-ooh)
Oh boy, you drive me crazy, bitch, you make me hurl

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Girl, you can jump on Shady's dick
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
Kiss my lips? Bitch, why ask?
Kiss my dick, get my cash?
I'd rather have you whip my ass
Don't put out? I'll put you out
Won't get out? I'll push you out
Puss blew out, poppin' shit
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out
Am I too nice? Buy you ice?
Bitch, if you died, wouldn't buy you life

What, you Mariah? Fly through twice

Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman

Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
Yeah, we fucked—bitch, so what?
That's about as far as your buddy goes
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
You don't want that, neither do I
I don't wanna flip when I see you with guys
Too much pride, between you and I
Not a jealous man, but females lie
But I guess that's just what sluts do
How could it ever be just us two?
I'd never love you enough to trust you
We just met and I just fucked you
But I do know one thing though

First thing you say: I'm not fazed
I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me
Ooh yeah, girl, run that game
Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
""Rot In Pieces,"" uh, that's great
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
That's ammo for my arsenal
I'll slap you off that bar stool
There goes another lawsuit
Leave handprints all across you
Good Lordy, whoadie
You must be gone off that water bottle
You want what you can't have
Ooh girl, that's too damn bad
Don't touch what you can't grab
End up with two backhands
Put anthrax on a Tampax
And slap you 'til you can't stand
Girl, you just blew your chance
Don't mean to ruin your plans

But I do know one thing though

Flyin' to a party I am not invited to, feelin' like the streets need me (What up?)
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spider move like C Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons

Why these dudes tryna figure out
How to do a freestyle as fly as me? (Why?)

That I'd be the most hated, though made it
So that there's no shame, it's okay to own it
'Cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged ho
But now those days are over

Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle to sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal
I'm fuckin' these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals

A little bit unpredictable, I spit the formidable
That you bitches fuckin' with, the original
I consider me and Nickel identical ('Dentical!)—but not us

Otherwise one has nothin' to do with the other

Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back
That's why my pen needs a pad, 'cause my rhymes on the rag
Just like I did with addiction, I'm 'bout to kick it
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets
Got 'em still on the fence whether to picket
But quick to get it impaled when I tell 'em, ""Stick it!""
So sick, I'm looking pale—wait, that's my pigment
'Bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch!

And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch
Been Public Enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M

Hope so, now ho

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berzerk)
Get your vinyls

And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in styrofoam
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo
With the ugly Kardashian, Lamar, oh
Sorry, yo—we done both set the bar low
Far as hard drugs are though, that's the past
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow
And girl, I ain't got no money to borrow
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone: car note
Oh, Marshall Mathers
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered
Kangol's and Carheartless Cargos
Girl, you're fixin' to get your heart broke
Don't be absurd, ma'am, you birdbrain, baby
I ain't called anybody baby since Birdman, unless you're a swallow (Ha-ha!)
Word, Rick? (Word, man, you heard)
But don't get discouraged, girl
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam

Kick your shoes off, let your hair down
(And go berserk) All night long
Grow your beard out, just weird out
(And go berserk) All night long
We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So, baby, make just like K-Fed
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket
Life's too short to not go for broke
So everybody, everybody (Go berserk)
Grab your vial, yeah

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down
So turn the volume loud
'Cause it's mayhem 'til the A.M
So crank the bass up like crazy
And let yourself go, let yourself go
Say, ""Fuck it!"" before we kick the bucket

(Photoshoot!)
You know, everybody's been tellin' me
What they think about me for the last few months
It's too loud
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud
Three's not a crowd all up in it
Slow fire
Don't fall on my face
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't fall on my–

Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
In that first marijuana tape—guess I got a chronic case (Yeah)
And I ain't just blowin' smoke, 'less it's in your mama's face
I know this time Paul and Dre
They won't tell me what not to say (Nope!)
And though me and my party days
Have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made ""Not Afraid"" (Yah)
One last time for Charlamagne
If my response is late, it's just how long it takes
To hit my fuckin' radar, I'm so far away (Woo)
These rappers are like Hunger Games
One minute, they're mockin' JAY (Yeah)
Next minute, they get their style from Migos or they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it Walk-on-Water-Gate
I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin', I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once (Yeah!)
You wanted Shady? You got him!
You might also like
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Rrr!)
Don't fall on my fate (Ha)

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped
The closest thing he's had to hits is smackin' bitches (Pump it up!)
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again, I'll have you twisted
Like you had it when you thought you had me slippin' at the telly (Yeah)
Even when I'm gettin' brain, you'll never catch me with a thot
Lacking with it, ""He ain't spittin' like this on his last shit""
Ho, you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin' I'll slow or let up
Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
Hopin' that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, ""Hold your head up!"" (Huh?)—Kathy Griffin
Stackin' ammunition, slap the clip in, cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (Pew)—Gabby Gifford
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler create nothin', I see why you called yourself a ******, bitch
It's not just 'cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me
You better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater
Whatever his name is to help you put together
Some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature
When I stole the show (Ha), sorry if I took forever (Haha)
Don't fall on my face (Yeah)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (I won't)
Don't fall on my fate (Line 'em up!)
Don't fall on my faith, oh (Haha)
Don't fall on my fate (It's too easy)

Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you make your run-in for you
Detractors, I'ma have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew (Ah!)
Just what the doctor ordered
Revenge is the best medicine (Yeah)
Increase the dose, from least to most
And then tell the Grammys to go and fuck themselves
They suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches
So they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to MC the show
Every parasite needs a host (Ha-ha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (Yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and a prayer (Huh)
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin' this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin' it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin' a Oxford dictionary in my pocket
How I'm buryin' these artists
On a scale of 'turnt' you're 'minus'
Mine says 'very', yours says 'hardly'
And what's scary is you prob'ly can compare me to your car 'cause I'm just barely gettin' started (Woo)
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the Hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone
Use your telephone and go fetch me the remote
Put my feet up and just make myself at home (Yeah)
I belong here, clown! Don't tell me 'bout the culture!
I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9""s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (Yeah)
It's too loud
Can't hear it coming down the hallway stairs from the parking lot
It's too loud

Everybody from the 313
Put your motherfuckin' hands up! Look, look
Now, while he stands tough
Notice that this man did not have his hands up
This Free World's got you gassed up
Now, who's afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?
One, two, three, and to the four
One Pac, two Pac, three Pac, four
Four Pac, three Pac, two Pac, one
You're Pac, he's Pac, no Pac, none
This guy ain't no motherfuckin' MC
I know everything he's 'bout to say against me
I am white, I am a fucking bum
I do live in a trailer with my mom
My boy Future is an Uncle Tom
I do got a dumb friend named Cheddar Bob
Who shoots himself in his leg with his own gun
I did get jumped by all six of you chumps
And Wink did fuck my girl
I'm still standin' here screaming, ""Fuck the Free World!""
Don't ever try to judge me, dude
You don't know what the fuck I've been through
But I know something about you
You went to Cranbrook, that's a private school
What's the matter, dawg? You embarrassed?
This guy's a gangster? His real name's Clarence
And Clarence lives at home with both parents
And Clarence' parents have a real good marriage
This guy don't wanna battle, he's shook
'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks
He's scared to death, he's scared to look
At his fucking yearbook; fuck Cranbrook!
Fuck a beat, I'll go acappella
Fuck a Papa Doc, fuck a clock, fuck a trailer
Fuck everybody! Fuck y'all if you doubt me!

And fuck this battle, I don't wanna win, I'm outtie

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — ""Wait!
Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!
Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie

You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?

Oh, what a beautiful death, let's both wear white
If you go to heaven and they bring me to hell
Just sneak out and meet me, bring a box of L's
She fell in love with the bad guy, the bad guy
What you doing with them rap guys, them rap guys
They ain't see potential in me girl, but you see it
If it's me and you against the world, then so be it

I don't care if they give me life
I get all of my life from you
(Uhuu)
And if loving you had a price
I would pay my life for you

I hear sirens while we make love
Loud as hell, but they don't know
They're nowhere near us
I will hold your heart and your gun
I don't care if they come, noooo
I know it's crazy but
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
I don't care I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away
No I swear I'll never give it up
Give it up, give it up, give it all away

Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga, still nigga

O.J. like, ""I'm not black, I'm O.J.,"" okay

House nigga, don't fuck with me
I'm a field nigga, with shined cutlery
Gold-plated quarters, where the butlers be
I'ma play the corners where the hustlers be
I told him, ""Please don't die over the neighborhood
That your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood
That's how you rinse it""
I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'
I coulda bought a place in DUMBO before it was DUMBO
For like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million
Guess how I'm feelin'? Dumbo

Two years later, that shit worth two million
Few years later, that shit worth eight million
I can't wait to give this shit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie, I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that 2 to a 4, 4 to an 8
I turned my life into a nice first week release date
Y'all out here still takin' advances, huh?
Me and my niggas takin' real chances, uh

Do I find it so hard
When I know in my heart
I'm letting you down every day
Letting you down every day
Why do I keep on running away?

Look, I apologize, often womanize
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes
Took for these natural twins to believe in miracles
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
I harassed you out in Paris
""Please come back to Rome, you make it home""
We talked for hours when you were on tour
""Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone!""
I said: ""Don't embarrass me"" instead of ""Be mine""
That was my proposal for us to go steady
That was your 21st birthday
You matured faster than me, I wasn't ready
So I apologize
I seen the innocence leave your eyes
I still mourn its death and
I apologize for all the stillborns
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it
I apologize to all the women whom I toyed with your emotions
'Cause I was emotionless
And I apologize 'cause at your best, you are love
And because I fall short of what I say I'm all about
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed
And you stare blankly into space
Thinkin' of all the time, you wasted it on all this basic shit
So I apologize

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh

I apologize
Our love was one for the ages and I contained us
And all this ratchet shit and we more expansive
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions
Or sleep with our back turned
We supposed to vacay 'til our backs burn
We're supposed to laugh 'til our heart stops
And then meet in a space where the dark stop
And let love light the way
Like the men before me, I cut off my nose to spite my face
I never wanted another woman to know
Something about me that you didn't know
I promised, I cried, I couldn't hold
I suck at love, I think I need a do-over
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over
I stew over; ""What if—""
""You over my shit?""

I'm never gonna treat you
I'm never gonna treat you like I should
Oh
And if my children knew
I don't even know what I would do
If they ain't look at me the same
I would prob'ly die with all the shame
""You did what with who?""
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?
""You risked that for Blue?""
If I wasn't a superhero in your face
My heart breaks for the day I have to explain my mistakes
And the mask goes away
And Santa Claus is fake
And you go online and see
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay

I'm never gonna treat you like I should76Embed",https://images.genius.com/dab4680bbb0569024ef3df3d1e87c277.570x570x1.jpg

Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling-bling)
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?
See, I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined
The same dude you gave nothin', I made somethin' doin'
What I do through and through and
I give you the news with a twist, it's just his ghetto point of view
The renegade, you been afraid I penetrate pop culture
Bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they pop toasters
And they live with they moms, got dropped roadsters
From botched robberies, niggas crouched over
Mami's knocked up 'cause she wasn't watched over
Knocked down by some clown
When child support knocked, ""No, he's not around""
Now, how that sound to ya? Jot it down
I bring you through the ghetto without ridin' 'round
Hidin' down, duckin' strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day
How you rate music that thugs with nothin' relate to it?
I help them see they way through it, not you
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes
Bet everything you worth, you'll lose your tie and your shirt
Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen
I ain't no politician, but I'll kick it with 'em a minute
'Cause see, they call me a menace and if the shoe fits, I'll wear it
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth, grin and bear it
Now who's the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative lyrics?
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics
Usin' his music to steer it, sharin' his views and his merits?
But there's a huge interference, they're sayin' you shouldn't hear it
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish
But I'm debated, disputed, hated and viewed in America
As a motherfuckin' drug addict, like you didn't experiment?
Now, now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror
And see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrassed
And I got nothin' to do but make you look stupid as parents
You fuckin' do-gooders, too bad you couldn't do good at marriage (Haha)
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here?
I don't think you do, so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo

If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son

Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes
I'm from the hood, stupid! What type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatos
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin' dough
I'm like, ""Fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole!
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward""
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show
They don't play my hits, well, I don't give a shit, so
Rap mags try and use my black ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads

I'm in Maison, ah, Martin Margiela
On the table, screamin', ""Fuck the other side! They jealous!""
We got a banquette full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in 'cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaires' Row
Life's a game, but it's not fair
I break the rules, so I don't care
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain
Victory's within the mile
Almost there, don’t give up now
Only thing that's on my mind
Is who's gon' run this town tonight
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Who's gon' run this town tonight?

It's crazy how you can go from bein' Joe Blow
To everybody on your dick; no homo
I bought my whole family whips; no Volvos
Next time I’m in church: please, no photos
Police escorts, everybody passports
This the life that everybody ask for
This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life Good Will Hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring
Reebok, baby, you need to try some new things
Have you ever had shoes without shoe strings?
""What's that, Ye?"" ""Baby, these heels""
""Is that a May— what?!"" ""Baby, these wheels""
You trippin' when you ain't sippin', have a refill
You feelin' like you runnin', huh? Now you know how we feel (What’s up?)
Hey, hey (Yeah, yeah)
Hey, hey (What’s up?)
Hey, hey
Hey, we gon' run this town tonight

Kill JAY-Z, they'll never love you
You'll never be enough, let's just keep it real, JAY-Z
Fuck JAY-Z, I mean, you shot your own brother
How can we know if we can trust JAY-Z?
And you know better, nigga, I know you do
But you gotta do better, boy, you owe it to Blue
You had no father, you had the armor
But you got a daughter, gotta get softer
Die JAY-Z, this ain't back in the days
You don't need an alibi, JAY-Z
Cry JAY-Z, we know the pain is real
But you can't heal what you never reveal
What's up, JAY-Z? You know you owe the truth
To all the youth that fell in love with JAY-Z
You got people you love you sold drugs to
You got high on the life, that shit drugged you
You walkin' around like you invincible
You dropped outta school, you lost your principles
I know people backstab you, I felt bad too
But this 'fuck everybody' attitude ain't natural
But you ain't a saint, this ain't kumbaye
But you got hurt because you did cool by 'Ye
You gave him twenty million without blinkin'
He gave you twenty minutes on stage, fuck was he thinkin'?
""Fuck wrong with everybody?"" is what you sayin'
But if everybody's crazy, you're the one that's insane
Crazy how life works
You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
You stabbed Un over some records
Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""
Let go your ego over your right shoulder
Your left is sayin', ""Finish your breakfast!""
You egged Solange on
Knowin' all along, all you had to say you was wrong
You almost went Eric Benét
Let the baddest girl in the world get away
I don't even know what else to say
Nigga, never go Eric Benét!
I don't even know what you woulda done
In the future other niggas playin' football with your son
You woulda lost it
13 bottles of Ace of Spade, what it did to Boston

You bringing them boys to men, how them boys gon' win?
This is grown man B-I, get you rolled into triage, bitch
Your reach ain't long enough, dunny

I showed you your first TEC on tour with Large Professor (Me, that's who)
Then I heard your album 'bout your TEC on the dresser
So yeah, I sampled your voice, you was using it wrong (I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me)

This is a public service announcement
Sponsored by Just Blaze and the good folks at Roc-A-Fella Records
Fellow Americans, it is with the utmost pride and sincerity that I present this recording as a living testament and recollection of history in the making during our generation

Allow me to re-introduce myself
My name is Hov, oh, H to the O-V
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z
I guess even back then you can call me
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov
Fresh out the fryin' pan into the fire
I be the music biz number one supplier
Flyer than a piece of paper bearin' my name
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin' my chain, that's right
Hov, oh, not D.O.C.
But similar to them letters, ""No One Can Do It Better""
I check cheddar like a food inspector
My homie Strict told me, ""Dude, finish your breakfast""
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude with the Lexus
Fast-forward the jewels and the necklace
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this
I shoot at you actors like movie directors
This ain't a movie, dog (Oh, shit)

Now before I finish, let me just say I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you
Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm gone
And I don't care what you think about me—but just remember, when it hits the fan, brother, whether it's next year, ten years, twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say that these brothers lied to you jack

Ving ain't lie
I done came through the block in everything that's fly
I'm like Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex
I never claimed to have wings on
Nigga, I get my ""By any means"" on whenever there's a drought
Get your umbrellas out because that's when I brainstorm
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game
I just rolled the dice, trying to get some change
And I'd do it twice, ain't no sense in me
Lying as if I am a different man
And I could blame my environment but
There ain't no reason why I be buying expensive chains
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers
Niggas getting high within the game
If you do then, how would you explain?
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins
I got a hustler spirit, nigga, period
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer
No matter where you go, you are what you are player
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone
Either love me, or leave me alone

Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down
I can understand why you want a divorce now
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with
But deep inside, a nigga so sick

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes

I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry, uh
Can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I got to make the song cry

On repeat, the CD of Big's ""Me & My Bitch""
Watchin' Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin' to be that shit
Empty gun in your hand, sayin', ""Let me see that clip""
Shopping sprees, pull out your Visa quick
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6
We was so happy poor, but when we got rich
That's when our signals got crossed and we got flipped
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit
Made me speed that quick, let me see, that's it
It was the cheese, helped them bitches get amnesia quick
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin' they love me
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me
Then I showed up in that dubbed-out buggy
And then they got fuzzy, and they don't remember that
And I don't remember you
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
Yeah, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see it comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone
Word back home is that you had a special friend
So what was oh so special then?
You have given away without gettin' at me
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?
I know the way a nigga livin' was wack
But you don't get a nigga back like that
Shit, I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that
You don't throw away what we had just like that
I was just fuckin' them girls, I was gon' get right back
They say you can't turn a bad girl good
But once a good girl's gone bad, she's gone forever
I'll mourn forever
Shit, I've got to live with the fact I did you wrong forever
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta let the song cry
I know, I seen 'em comin' down your eyes
But I gotta make the song cry
I can't see 'em comin' down my eyes
So I gotta make the song cry

Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile, you recordin'?

Slammin' Bentley doors like we invented doors
20 years ago we drove Bentley Azures
We drinkin' Cristal then
Yeah, kept the tray on me like Chris Paul then
Drinkin' Ace of Spades like it's codeine now
Tryna put a million on the whole team now
Push through the pain so we can see new life
So all the ladies havin' babies, see ya sacrifice
Mama had four kids, but she's a lesbian
Had to pretend so long that she's a thespian
Had to hide in the closet, so she medicate
Society shame and the pain was too much to take
Cried tears of joy when you fell in love
Don't matter to me if it's a him or her
I just wanna see you smile through all the hate
Marie Antoinette, baby, let 'em eat cake

Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
Smile
Here's your friendly announcer
Smile

Far as draft picks, my name did not get called
Bet before I go I put a billion on the board
Hall of Fame Hov, I did it all without a pen
Y'all knew that was comin', I had to remind y'all again, huh?
Flyin' paper planes through the projects
Now the whole projects on my jet
Now you see the real in the front row
In every one of y'all televised shows
Super facts
Niggas switched sides, traded pride, we don't do all that
A loss ain't a loss, it's a lesson
Appreciate the pain, it’s a blessin'

Bad times turn to good memories, smile
Even when I'm gone and you remember me, smile
Good times never fade away, smile
Even if I'm not with you here today, smile
Good morn' or evening, friends
I mastered my aesthetics
I know you often heard me wax poetic
'Bout bein' back in the Lexus
But trust me, that was nothin', a nigga up in
The hundreds of millions, I have no ceilings
Ah, this that feelin', I'm that boy
Anita Baker's ""You Bring Me Joy"" slappin' out of the toy
The separation is clear in my rear-view mirror
Objects is further than they appear
Oh yeah, I was born with a pair, playin' for high stakes
Norman's Cay, he looked up and out of the Lear
How niggas can't relate?
Fuck a slice of the apple pie, want my own cake
In charge of my own fate, respect Jimmy Iovine
But he gotta respect the Elohim as a whole new regime
And niggas playin' for power, huh
So our music is ours, niggas own their own houses
Ours was, ""Fuck you, pay me""
Now it's, ""Fuck payin' me, I pay you
Put the rest away for Blue""
That blood money I giggle at it
Can't even support my miss' habit
Jewelry shoppin' in Pa- all ya jewelers should be embarrassed
Huh, blood diamonds drippin' with guilt, I still ain't trippin'
That's life, winners and losers
Drug dealers and abusers, America like me ruthless
My therapist said I relapsed
I said, ""Pre-haps I Freudian slipped in European whips""
God sent me to break the chain, I'm the true and livin'
God in the flesh, the rest of these niggas is vain
A stain on the white suit, inferior IQ
Niggas'll rip your shit off TIDAL just to spite you
Ahhhh, what did I do? 'Cept try to free you
Niggas'll love you but hate you 'cause they can't be you
Dump 'em all in the bayou, uh
Everybody wave bye to the guy you thought you could lie to
This was meant to be a haiku, huh
But my story's too wide to fit inside the line or two
Oh, these that drugs, heron flow, I spaz on the stove
This is Hov, no flex zone, nigga, who lied to you?
Look, you a pedestrian, don't ever question the security I provided you
Oh y'all thought I was washed? I'm at the cleaners
Launderin' dirty money like the Teamsters, huh
Shout out to Hoffa back home, he in the church
When I heard you got booked, that shit hurt
Feel for you bro, we know the system don't work
Take a young nigga freedom over some dirt
Yet it's legal in Colorado, yet, we deny
Black entrepreneurs, free enterprise
That's why it's a black market, that's why it's called the trap
That's why it's called the projects 'cause it's exactly that
All these people was gon' kill me, heh
'Cause the more I reveal me, the more they 'fraid of the real me
Welcome back Carter, smile
Living in the shadow
Can you imagine what kind of life it is to live?
In the shadows people see you as happy and free
Because that's what you want them to see
Living two lives, happy, but not free
You live in the shadows for fear of someone hurting your family or the person you love
The world is changing and they say it's time to be free
But you live with the fear of just being me
Living in the shadow feels like the safe place to be
No harm for them, no harm for me
But life is short, and it's time to be free
Love who you love, because life isn't guaranteed

Every time you think they got me I switch the planner
Bulletproof this, radio scanners

Balling 'til they ban us
You getting too much bread, they try to jam you
Boy from the hood but got White House clearance
Sorry y'all, I don't agree with y'all parents
Politicians never did shit for me
Except lie to me, distort history
Wanna give me jail time and a fine
Fine, let me commit a real crime
I might buy a kilo for Chief Keef
Out of spite, I just might flood these streets
Hear the freedom in my speech
Got an onion from Universal, read it and weep
Would've brought the Nets to Brooklyn for free
Except I made millions off it, you fuckin' dweeb
I still own the building, I'm still keeping my seat
Y'all buy that bullshit, you'd better keep y'all receipt

But you don't need this shit anyway, chill with me on the beach

When it's from China, the very mic that I'm using
Idiot wind, the Bob Dylan of rap music

Hide 'til it's bright out
Oh, just another lonely night
Are you willing to sacrifice your life?

Bitch, I'm a monster, no-good bloodsucker
Fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble
As you run through my jungles, all you hear is rumbles
Kanye West samples, here's one for example

Gossip, gossip, nigga, just stop it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
Profit, profit, nigga, I got it
Everybody know I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands at the concert
I'ma need to see your fuckin' hands
Uh, the best living or dead hands down, huh
Less talk, more head right now, huh
And my eyes more red than the devil is
And I'm 'bout to take it to another level, bitch
Matter who you go and get, ain't nobody cold as this
Do the rap and the track, triple-double, no assists
And my only focus is stayin' on some bogus shit
Arguin' with my older bitch, actin' like I owe her shit
I heard the beat, the same raps that gave the track pain
Bought the chain that always give me back pain
Fucking up my money so, yeah, I had to act sane
Chi nigga, but these hoes love my accent
Chick came up to me and said, ""This the number to dial
If you wanna make your number one your number two now""
Mix that Goose and Malibu, I call it ""Malibooyah""
Goddamn, Yeezy always hit 'em with a new style
Know that motherfucker, well, what you gon' do now?
Whatever I wanna do, gosh, it's cool now
Know I'm gonna do, ah, it's the new now
Think you motherfuckers really really need to cool out
'Cause you'll never get on top of this
So, mami, best advice is just to get on top of this
Have you ever had sex with a pharaoh?
Ah, put the pussy in a sarcophagus

Head of the class and she just won a swallowship

Rape and pillage your village, women and children
Everybody want to know what my Achilles heel is
Love, I don't get enough of it
All I get is these vampires and bloodsuckers
All I see is these niggas I made millionaires
Millin' about, spillin' they feelings in the air
All I see is these fake fucks with no fangs
Tryna draw blood from my ice-cold veins

You could be the king, but watch the queen conquer
Okay, first things first, I'll eat your brains
Then I'ma start rocking gold teeth and fangs
'Cause that's what a motherfuckin' monster do
Hair dresser from Milan, that's the monster 'do
Monster Giuseppe heel, that's the monster shoe
Young Money is the roster and a monster crew
And I'm all up, all up, all up in the bank with the funny face
And if I'm fake, I ain't notice 'cause my money ain't
So let me get this straight, wait, I'm the rookie?
But my features and my shows ten times your pay?
50K for a verse, no album out
Yeah, my money's so tall that my Barbies got to climb it
Hotter than a Middle Eastern climate, violent
Tony Matterhorn, dutty wine it, wine it
Nicki on them titties when I sign it
That's how these niggas so one-track-minded
But really, really I don't give an F-U-C-K
""Forget Barbie, fuck Nicki, sh-she's fake""
""She on a diet,"" but my pockets eatin' cheesecake
And I'll say, bride of Chucky, it's child's play
Just killed another career, it's a mild day
Besides, Ye, they can't stand besides me
I think me, you, and Am' should ménage Friday
Pink wig, thick ass, give 'em whiplash
I think big, get cash, make 'em blink fast
Now look at what you just saw, this is what you live for
Ah, I'm a motherfuckin' monster
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide
And I, I wouldn't last these shows
So I, I am headed home (Headed home)
I, I crossed the limelight
And I'll, I'll let God decide, 'cide (No)

I'm tryna keep my faith
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
I'm tryna keep my faith
So why send oppression, not blessings?
Why, oh, why'd You do me wrong? (More)
You persecute the weak
Because it makes You feel so strong (Safe)
Don't have much strength to fight
So I look to the light (War)
To make these wrongs turn right
Head up high, I look to the light
Hey, 'cause I know that You'll make everything alright
And I know that You'll take good care of Your child
Oh, no longer am afraid of the night
'Cause I, I look to the light
When they come for You, I will shield Your name
I will field their questions, I will feel Your pain
No one can judge
They don't, they don't know
They don't know

Foot on the Devil's neck 'til it drifted, Pangaea
I'm moving all my family from Chatham to Zambia
Treat the demons just like Pam
I mean, I fuck with your friends, but damn, Gina
I been this way since Arthur was anteater
Now they wanna hit me with the woo wap, the bam
Tryna snap photos of familia
My daughter look just like Sia, you can't see her
You can feel the lyrics, the spirit coming in braille
Tubman of the underground, come and follow the trail
I made “Sunday Candy,” I'm never going to hell
I met Kanye West, I'm never going to fail
He said, ""Let's do a good ass job with 'Chance 3'""
I hear you gotta sell it to snatch the Grammy
Let's make it so free and the bars so hard
That there ain't one gosh darn part you can't tweet
This is my part, nobody else speak
This is my part, nobody else speak
This little light of mine
Glory be to God, yeah
I'ma make sure that they go where they can't go
If they don't wanna ride, I'ma still give 'em raincoats
Know what God said when He made the first rainbow
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Ugh, I'm just having fun with it
You know that a nigga was lost
I laugh in my head
'Cause I bet that my ex looking back like a pillar of salt
Ugh, 'cause they'll flip the script on your ass like Wesley and Spike
You cannot mess with the light
Look at lil' Chano from 79th
We on an ultralight beam
We on an ultralight beam
This is a God dream
This is a God dream
This is everything
Everything

(Yes, God)
(Hallelujah)
I'm tryna keep my faith
(Yes, Jesus)
But I'm looking for more
Somewhere I can feel safe
And end my holy war
Father, this prayer is for everyone that feels they're not good enough
This prayer's for everybody that feel that they're too messed up
For everyone that feels they've said ""I'm sorry"" too many times
You can never go too far when you can't come back home again
That's why I need...

She say she only here for her girl birthday
They ordered champagne but still look thirsty
Rock Forever 21, but just turned thirty
I know I got a bad reputation
Walk-around-always-mad reputation
Leave-a-pretty-girl-sad reputation
Start a Fight Club, Brad reputation
I turnt the nightclub out of the basement
I'll turn the plane around, your ass keep complainin'
How you gon' be mad on vacation?
Dutty wining 'round all these Jamaicans
Uh, this that prom shit
This that what-we-do-don't-tell-your-mom shit

Hey, you remember where we first met?
Okay, I don't remember where we first met
But hey, admittin' is the first step
And hey, you know ain't nobody perfect
And I know, with the hoes I got the worst rep
But hey, their backstroke I'm tryna perfect
And hey, ayo, we made it: Thanksgivin'
So hey, maybe we can make it to Christmas
She asked me what I wished for on my wishlist
Have you ever asked your bitch for other bitches?
Maybe we could still make it to the church steps
But first, you gon' remember how to forget
After all these long-ass verses
I'm tired, you tired, Jesus wept
I know you're tired (Tired) of lovin', of lovin'
With nobody to love, nobody, nobody
So just grab somebody, no leavin' this party

Chill, chill, chill, chill, chill, chill
My mama was raised in the era when
Clean water was only served to the fairer skin
Doin' clothes, you would've thought I had help
But they wasn't satisfied unless I picked the cotton myself
You see it's broke nigga racism
That's that, ""Don't touch anything in the store""
And it's rich nigga racism
That's that, ""Come in, please buy more""
""What you want, a Bentley? Fur coat? A diamond chain?
All you blacks want all the same things""
Used to only be niggas, now everybody playin'
Spendin' everything on Alexander Wang
New slaves

You see it's leaders and it's followers
But I'd rather be a dick than a swallower

And I know I did damage
'Cause the look in your eyes is killing me

From a very far away place
All for a chance to be a star
Nowhere seems to be too far

No more parties in L.A

No more parties in L.A
Please, baby, no more parties in L.A., uh

Hey, baby, you forgot your Ray Bans
And my sheets still orange from your spray-tan
It was more than soft porn for the K-Man
She remember my Sprinter, said ""I was in the grape van""
Um—well, cutie, I like your bougie booty
Come, Erykah Badu-me—well, let's make a movie
Hell, you know my repertoire is like a wrestler
I show you the ropes, connect the dots
A country girl in North Hollywood
Mama used to cook red beans and rice
Now it's Denny's, 4 in the morning, spoil your appetite
Liquor pouring and niggas swarming your section with erection
Smoke in every direction, middle finger pedestrians
R&B singers and lesbians, rappers and managers
Music and iPhone cameras
This shit unanimous for you, it's damaging for you, I think
That pussy should only be holding exclusive rights to me, I mean
He flew you in this motherfucker on first class
Even went out his way so you could check in an extra bag
Now you wanna divide the yam like it equate the math?
That shit don't add up, you're making him mad as fuck
She said she came out here to find an A-list rapper
I said, ""Baby, spin that 'round and say the alphabet backwards""
You're dealing with malpractice, don't kill a good nigga's confidence
Just 'cause he a nerd and you don't know what a condom is
The head still good, though; the head still good, though
Make me say ""Nam Myoho Renge Kyo""
Make a nigga say big words and act lyrical
Make me get spiritual, make me believe in miracles
Buddhist monks and Cap'n Crunch cereal
Lord have mercy, thou will not hurt me
Five buddies all herded up on a Thursday
Bottle service, head service, I came in first place
The opportunity, the proper top of breast and booty cheek
The pop community, I mean these bitches come with union fee
And I want two of these, moving units through consumer streets
Then my shoe released, she was kickin' in gratuity
And yeah, G, I was all for it
She said, ""K-Lamar, you kinda dumb to be a poet
I'ma put you on game for the lames that don't know they a rookie
Instagram is the best way to promote some pussy""

Friday night, tryna make it into the city
Breakneck speeds, passenger seat—somethin' pretty
Thinking back to how I got here in the first place
Second-class bitches wouldn't let me on first base
A backpack nigga with luxury tastebuds
And the Louis Vuitton store got all of my pay stubs
Got pussy from beats I did for niggas more famous
When did I become A-list? I wasn't even on a list
Strippers get invited to where they only got hired
When I get on my Steve Jobs, somebody gon' get fired
I was uninspired since Lauryn Hill retired
And 3 Stacks, man, you preaching to the choir
Any rumor you ever heard about me was true and legendary
I done got Lewinsky'd and paid secretaries
For all my niggas with babies by bitches
That use they kids as meal tickets
Not knowin' the disconnect from the father
The next generation will be the real victims
I can't fault 'em, really
I remember Amber told my boy
No matter what happens, she ain't goin' back to Philly
Back to our regularly scheduled programmin'
Of weak content and slow jammin'
But don't worry, this one's so jammin'
You know it, L.A., it's so jammin'
I be thinkin' every day
Mulholland Drive need to put up some goddamn barricades
I be paranoid every time, the pressure
The problem ain't I be drivin', the problem is I be textin'
My psychiatrist got kids that I inspired
First song they played for me was 'bout their friend that just died
Textin' and drivin' down Mulholland Drive
That's why I'd rather take the 405
I be worried 'bout my daughter, I be worried 'bout Kim
But Saint is baby 'Ye, I ain't worried 'bout him
Had my life threatened by best friends with selfish intents
What I'm supposed to do?
Ride around with a bulletproof car and some tints?
Every agent I know, know I hate agents
I'm too black, I'm too vocal, I'm too flagrant
Something smellin' like shit, that's the new fragrance
It's just me, I do it my way, bitch
Some days I'm in my Yeezys, some days I'm in my Vans
If I knew y'all made plans, I wouldn't have popped the Xans
I know some fans thought I wouldn't rap like this again
But the writer's block is over; emcees, cancel your plans
A thirty-eight-year-old eight-year-old with rich nigga problems
Tell my wife that I hate the Rolls so I don't never drive it
It took six months to get the Maybach all matted out
And my assistant crashed it soon as they backed it out
Goddamn! Got a bald fade, I might slam
Pink fur, got Nori dressin' like Cam
Thank God for me! (Los Angeles)
Whole family gettin' money, thank God for E!
I love rockin' jewelry, a whole neckful
Bitches say he fun-ny and disrespectful
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my shoes
I feel like Pablo when I see me on the news
I feel like Pablo when I'm workin' on my house
Tell 'em party's in here, we don't need to go out
We need the turbo thots, high speed, turbo thots
Drop-dro-dro-dro-drop, like Robocop
She brace herself and hold my stomach, good dick'll do that
She keep pushin' me back, good dick'll do that
She push me back when the dick go too deep
This good dick'll put your ass to sleep

For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous (Goddamn)

Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous (Goddamn)

I'm living in that 21st century, doing something mean to it
Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it
I guess every superhero need his theme music

No one man should have all that power
The clock’s ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
(21st-century schizoid man)

The system broken, the school's closed, the prison's open
We ain't got nothing to lose, motherfucker, we rolling
Huh? Motherfucker, we rolling
With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
In this white man world, we the ones chosen
So goodnight, cruel world, I'll see you in the morning
Huh? I'll see you in the morning
This is way too much, I need a moment

No one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the power
'Til then, fuck that, the world's ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
He knows he's so fuckin' gifted
I just needed time alone with my own thoughts
Got treasures in my mind, but couldn't open up my own vault
My childlike creativity, purity, and honesty
Is honestly being crowded by these grown thoughts
Reality is catching up with me
Taking my inner child, I'm fighting for custody
With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
As I look down at my diamond-encrusted piece

Thinking no one man should have all that power
The clock's ticking, I just count the hours
Stop tripping, I'm tripping off the powder
'Til then, fuck that, the world’s ours
And they say, and they say
And they say, and they say

Lost in translation with a whole fuckin' nation
They say I was the abomination of Obama's nation
Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
At the end of the day, goddamnit, I'm killing this shit
I know damn well y'all feeling this shit
I don't need your pussy, bitch, I'm on my own dick
I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
How Ye doing? I'm survivin'
I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'

They gon' have to rope me off
Someday the drama'll be gone
And they'll play this song on and on
Sometimes I take all the shine
Talk like I drank all the wine

Caught between space and time

Did what I want and I say what I want
And I thought you was with me, like how you get sensitive?

I got this Holy Water, that's my beverages
I gotta help myself out of selfishness
I just bought a floor out of Selfridges
I gotta make sure they know who they messin' with
I gotta tell 'em ""sorry,"" they too delicate
I gotta stay with God where the blessings is
I ain't deliverin' Heavenly messages just for the hell of it
Don't try to test me, I keep it clean, but it can get messy
I talk to God every day, that's my bestie
They playin' soccer in my backyard, I think I see Messi
And this money could never neglect me
I pray that my family, they never resent me
And she fell in love with me soon as she met me
We both got a bag but my bag is more heavy
We had to stop countin', it's gettin' too petty
You not a real stepper, you can't overstep me
Just sit back and listen and watch how He bless me
He wait 'til I fall and then pull up and catch me
Your check is too small, you can't run up and check me

La, la, la la (Yeah)
Wait 'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to Heaven
When I awoke, I spent that on a necklace
I told God I'd be back in a second
Man, it's so hard not to act reckless
To whom much is given, much is tested
Get arrested, guess until he get the message
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny
And what I do? Act more stupidly
Bought more jewelry, more Louis V
My mama couldn't get through to me
The drama, people suing me
I'm on TV talking like it's just you and me
I'm just saying how I feel, man
I ain't one of the Cosbys, I ain't go to Hillman
I guess the money should've changed him
I guess I should've forgot where I came from

La, la, la la (Ayy!)
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing (Yeah! Haha!)

Let up the suicide doors
This is my life, homie, you decide yours
I know that Jesus died for us
But I couldn't tell ya who decide wars
So I parallel double-parked that motherfucker sideways
Old folks talking 'bout, ""Back in my day""
But homie, this is my day
Class started two hours ago, oh, am I late?
No, I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it
They say I talk with so much emphasis
Ooh, they so sensitive
Don't ever fix your lips like collagen
And say something when you gon' end up apolog'ing
Let me know if it's a problem then
Aight, man, holla, then

La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la (Yeah!)
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
You can't tell me nothing
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing
Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash
Let that man get past
He don't even stop to get gas
If he can move through the rumors
He can drive off of fumes 'cause
How he move in a room full of no's?
How he stay faithful in a room full of hoes?
Must be the pharaohs, he in tune with his soul
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold
Treasure, what's your pleasure?
Life is a–uh–depending how you dress her
So if the Devil wear Prada, Adam Eve wear nada
I'm in between, but way more fresher
With way less effort
'Cause when you try hard, that's when you die hard
Your homies looking like, ""Why, God?""
When they reminisce over you, my God

La, la, la la
Wait 'til I get my money right
La, la, la la
Then you can't tell me nothing, right?
Excuse me, was you saying something?
Uh-uh, you can't tell me nothing

I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga, don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, ""Ain't no music on"", she said, ""No, that weed is loud""
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'

Let me tell you 'bout my month y'all
Endless shopping, I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don't think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain't wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain't working fam
In-In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray, but if you had my life you'd understand
But, I can't fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We're all troubled in a world of trouble
It's scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I'm what you made, God, fuck yes, I'm so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren't my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Every day to find sane's a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors

Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out ""Fuck that""
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets

I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night

He's all alone, some things will never change

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep

I got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life

I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right I try and shed some light on a man

And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie

I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right

You're gonna out-rap me? I doubt that
Please, bitch, I'm a house rat
These raps are 'bout that cheese like mousetraps
Earthlings, I adapt to 'em
Certain things, I don't want to do, but have to in
Order to just act human
Like using a bathroom and vacuuming (Yeah)
Rapping in the booth in a triple fat goose hazmat suit
Bubble wrap and a mask too and
I don't think that's what they meant by trap music (Nah)
Running through ink like I'm tattooing (Yeah)
This is music to be murdered by, you love
Turn the volume up, I am fired up like a blunt
Bread is long like an Italian sub, I am drugs
That is probably why your opinion of me's high as fuck
And it's nonstop fury (Yeah)
'Cause I ain't holding 'em up like an armed robbery (Nah)
And God's my jury, so when I die, I'm not worried (Nah)
Prayers to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery (Yeah)
How the fuck is it that so many cops are dirty? (Huh?)
Stop, man, please, officer, I'm sorry
But I can't breathe when I got you on top of me
Your goddamn knee's on my carotid artery (Fuck)
The adventures of Moon Man & Slim (Ah)
Yes, who want it with them?
The trilogy continues
Serving niggas, yes, see what's on the menu (Yeah)
Watch 'em panic, hot damnit (Let's get it, baby)
Hope you fuckers understand it
The realer for you niggas
Come and get these scriptures (Yeah)
Rap God (Uh)

My heart thump, not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans with the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real?
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel

And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral

If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
This shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real

She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me

She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you (Yeah)

It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete (Yeah)
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete (Hmm)
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby

I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, you something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, ""No, not my Aria""
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria

Alright, run it
I never gave a fuck
I never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me
I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man
You gon' love me, man

They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with

But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like a bird sitting high, high

Close my eyes, high in the dark
It's a curtain call; come one, come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm something different, all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense
My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy

Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fuckin' slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitionin' to my inner, I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus, keep focusin', boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say, ""Keep it goin'""
All my youngins, they dumb and reppin', they always knowin'

Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here (Be here)
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here (Ain't here)
Big boss, I made your heart heavy (Uh-uh)

Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids (Lids)
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll, Daddy got the glow

Fro-for-days in a old AA
Ball' so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Wanna know what I think

Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
Lotta of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Some things will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother

Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day

I am the smartest man alive!

And nobody wanted to believe me

Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm

Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said, ""Tonight I feel immortal,"" ohh

I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day and night, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope

Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi, yeah
Yeah

Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to being dead, yeah
Life, live it, with nobody's help tips
Man, I'm just walking without being led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginning is always followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?

Went down a road with no lights on
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them
You become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents had said and well
Rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin'

See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things still trouble me

The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?

And if I do, I don't sense the truth in 'em
Distancing myself while I'm focusing, fo-focusing
Don't pretend to worry bout shit
Go through one ear and out the other
Better off saying nothing, nigga

Stop judging a nigga because they're different

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her

I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, ""Get him,"" she say, ""I got you""
I say, ""No, bitch, I said get him"" (Ha)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, ""What's wrong?"" He say, ""Nothing, keep resting,""
She say, ""What's missing?""—""How you know something missing?""
He scratched his head, she say, ""Get back in bed,""
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, ""Ooh""

I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, ""Don't be so obvious!""
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, ""Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,""
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I

Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, ""Good girl, just remember what I told you""
She gave me a salute, I say, ""Girl, you're a soldier!""
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
""Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down""
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona Lisa)
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! (No!)
You fucking with Wayne's!? (No!)
Bitch, gimme your phone! (No! Let me, let me take this call real quick—like a lollipop)
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself
She say, ""Ooh, daddy, ooh,""
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ""Ooh,"" dead emotion (Ooh)
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa

Ahem
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat; call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
You no wan' start Weezy 'cause the 'F' is for finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time; synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted 'cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin—what a fuckin' family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family, but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin', I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds; fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggas just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin' shit, and you niggas just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough, so I'ma keep on doin' this shit

Okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes, so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to Moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up; call it self-defense
Swear, man, I be seein' through these niggas like sequins
Niggas think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin' to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world; that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eatin', all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin', bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga all day and tomorrow
But these ma'fuckers talkin' crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full, I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall; outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch, stop playin', I do it like a king do
If these niggas animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell 'em bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it, and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin', you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money... uh
Paper chasin', tell that paper, ""Look, I'm right behind ya""
Bitch, real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep, so I can't find her
You niggas are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag, you would kill for
Money too strong; pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin' well, now wish me well
Tell 'em kiss my ass, call it kiss and tell
Yeah, word to my mama, I'm out of my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I play the side for you niggas that's tryna front, and see
Son of Gun, Son of Sam, you niggas the son of me
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flo' like Luda
Bitch, I flow like scuba, bitch, I'm bold like Cuba
And I keep a killer ho, she gon' blow right through ya
I be mackin', 'bout my stackin', amount I pack like a mover
Shout to ratchet for backin' out on behalf of my shooter
Niggas think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold, bitch, but our actions is cooler, Wayne
These niggas out they mind, I done told these fuck niggas so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind, tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
To feed them, on my grind, did I get a little love, keep throwin' my sign
In the middle, hit 'em up, piece on my side, ‘cause ain't no peace on my side

On the road, I do One Direction numbers, I don't fuckin' miss
Yeah, Stunna and Mack know
When Wayne was gone for eight months, we put this thing up on our back
And I was snappin' off on every single track though
Collect call from the boss like where we at though

Young Money!
You dig?
Mack, I'm going in

A millionaire, I'm a Young Money millionaire
Tougher than Nigerian hair
My criteria compared to your career just isn't fair
I'm a venereal disease, like a menstrual bleed
Through the pencil, and leak on the sheet of the tablet in my mind
'Cause I don't write shit, 'cause I ain't got time
'Cause my seconds, minutes, hours go to the almighty dollar
And the almighty power of that ch-cha-cha-cha-chopper
Sister, brother, son, daughter, father; mother-fuck a copper
Got the Maserati dancin' on the bridge, pussy poppin'
Tell the coppers, ""Ha-ha-ha-ha
You can't catch him, you can't stop him""
I go by them goon rules: if you can't beat 'em, then you pop 'em
You can't man 'em, then you mop 'em
You can't stand 'em, then you drop 'em
You pop 'em 'cause we pop 'em like Orville Redenbacher

Okay, you're a goon, but what's a goon to a goblin?
Nothin', nothin', you ain't scarin' nothin'

Call me what you want, bitch! Call me on my Sidekick!

Don't you hate a shy bitch? Yeah, I ate a shy bitch
She ain't shy no more, she changed her name to My Bitch, haha
Yeah, nigga, that's my bitch, so when she ask
For the money when you through, don't be surprised, bitch!
And it ain't trickin' if you got it
But you like a bitch with no ass: You ain't got shit
Motherfucker, I'm ill, not sick
And I'm okay, but my watch sick, yeah, my drop sick
Yeah, my Glock sick, and my knot thick — I'm it

Young Money!
Yeah
Four
Ahem!

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for a real nigga""
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggas is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, the Lord as my witness
So on my Libra scale I'm weighin' sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch? Well, just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin' my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me: nose-bleed seats
And today I went shoppin' and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here
Baby, you know the deal
And she bad, so maybe she won't, ugh
But shit, then again, maybe she will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, yeah
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will, she will, she will, ugh
Maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now
She will, she will, she will (Ugh)
Do it for the realest niggas in the fuckin' game right now
She will

Yeah

I tell her, ""Now go and pop that pussy for me!""
Haters can't see me, but them bitches still lookin' for me
And you could take that to the bank and deposit that
Put your two cents in and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about I, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry—call that ""whine 'n' dine""
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin' pulses
They say, ""Choose wisely,"" that's why I was chosen
Rockin' like asphalt, it's the cash fault
Looked in the face of Death and took its mask off
Now, I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south and her ass north
But I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split!

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say, ""I ain't doubt you for a second.""
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel
I wish we could take off

Uh, she just started to pop it for a nigga
And looked back and told me, ""Baby, it's real.""
And I say I ain't doubt you for a second
I squeeze it and I could tell how it feel (I feel like the sky is opening, and I am entering)
I wish we could take off and go anywhere but here baby you know the deal
(Feel like like the world is falling and I am rising)
'cause she bad, so maybe she won't
Uh, but shit then again maybe she will

Don't cry (Oh), don’t go
Won't lie, I fuckin' love you, woah

Why y’all staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin' down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin' like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fucking king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I’m hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
With a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads, ""Don’t cry, stay tuned""
Bring me back to life
Got to lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin’ afterlife
Rest in paradise

Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried the future
And Tunechi was born like, ""Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun""
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, ""It's just you and I""
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Mama tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll (Let 'em drop and roll)

Yeah, I put my shades on

I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ugh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggas faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurting
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes; why, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside looking in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it, nevermind
I've been gone too long, true or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home, yeah

I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eating, the label getting fatter
And yea, the tables turned, but I'm still sitting at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker cause the good die young
Everybody selling dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man, when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that hummingbird down, hummingbird don't hum

See y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher

And freedom was my girl, until they fucking took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids

Kane is in the building
Who else is really trying to fuck with Hollywood Cole
I'm with Marley G's bro
Flying Holly Grove chicks to my Hollywood shows
And I wanna tell you something that you probably should know
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh
My real friends never hearing from me
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes
Live in the same building, but we got different views
I got a couple cars, I never get to use
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in two's
And these days all the girls are down to roll
I hit the strip club, and all them bitches find a pole
Plus I been sipping, so this shit is moving kinda slow
Just tell my girl to tell her friend that it's time to go

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig
And I got my gun in my boo purse
And I don't bust back, because I shoot first

Meet me on the fresh train
Yes I'm in the building, you just on the list of guest names
And all of my riders do not give a fuck, X-Games
Guns turn you boys into pussies, sex change
And I smoke 'til I got chest pains
And you niggas know I rep my gang like Jessie James
Women are possessive, and they wanna possess Wayne
I been flyin' so long I fell asleep on the fucking plane
Skinny pants and some Vans
Call me Triple A, get my advance in advance, amen
As the world spin and dance in my hands
Life is a beach, I'm just playing in the sand
Uh, wake up and smell the pussy
You niggas can't see me, but never overlook me
I'm on a paper trail and ain't no telling where it took me
Yeah, and I ain't a killer but don't push me

Now tell me how you love it
You know you at the top when only heaven is right above it
We on, it's Young Money motherfucker
If you ain't running with it, run from it motherfucker
Alright, now somebody show some money in this bitch
And I got my B's with me like some honey in this bitch, you dig

And I don't bust back, because I shoot first
How do you say what's never said?
Beautiful black woman, I bet that bitch look better red
Limping off tour, 'cause I made more off my second leg
Motherfuckin' Birdman Junior, 11th Grade
Ball on automatic start
I can hand it to Drake or do a quarterback draw
Wildcat offense, check the paw prints
We in the building, you niggas in apartments
Uh, now come on be my blood donor
Flow so nice you ain't gotta put a rug on her
Do it big and let the small fall under that
Damn where you stumbled at? From where they make Gumbo at
Kane got the fucking beat jumping like a jumping jack
And you know me, I get on this bitch and have a heart attack
Hip-Hop, I'm the heart of that
Nigga, nothing short of that
President Carter, Young Money Democrat

Now tell me how you love it

Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore
What the fuck, yo? Where the love go?
Trade the ski mask for the muzzle
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?

I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind

You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryna get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, ma'fucker
‘Cause all this bullshit just made me strong, ma'fucker

So I pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head

Yeah
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

Uh
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I, I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
Huh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed

It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream: ""Fuck 'em all!""

Oops, time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages in

This crooked mind of mine got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what
I came to claim, but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another, I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my word, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye

For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, never had a love

When you was just a youngin, your looks were so precious
But now you're grown up, so fly it's like a blessing
But you can’t have a man look at you for five seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself, so when you got older
It seems like you came back ten times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder

See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in a corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
For a second you were here, now you over there
It's hard not to stare the way you're moving your body
Like you never had a love, had a love
You might also like
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault, wasn't in your intentions
To be the one here talking to me, be the one listening
But I admire your poppin' bottles and dippin'
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad, nobody else trippin'
You see a lot of crooks and them crooks still crook

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love

See, I just want you to know that you deserve the best
You’re beautiful, you’re beautiful
Yeah, and I want you to know
You’re far from the usual, far from the usual

You see, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner tryna put it together
How to love, how to love
See, you had a lot of crooks try to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love, how to love, yeah
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in this corner, tryna put it together

Been fucking the world, and nigga, I ain't cum yet
You fuck with me wrong, I knock your head off your neck
The flight too long, I got a bed on the jet
The guns are drawn and I ain't talking 'bout a sketch
I pay these niggas with a reality check
Prepared for the worst but still praying for the best
This game is a bitch, I got my hand up her dress
The money don't sleep, so Weezy can't rest
And AK-47 is my fucking address, huh

I'ma need a coupe, I won't need a roof
Flyer than Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
I got the flow, I'm tryin' to see the roof
Didn't wear a bulletproof so I got shot and you can see the proof
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth
Wonder if Stevie do?
But I'ma leave it to God, not Beaver, neither you
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O, and even U
Man, I got summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter than the sun
Got spring hatin' on me 'cause I ain't never sprung
Winter hatin' on me 'cause I'm colder than y'all
And I will never, I will never, I will never fall

And when they snooze, we up!
Feet up, like a paraplegia

In that red-and-yellow thing; old school Atlanta Hawk
Like I'm from College Park, but I'm from Hollygrove
Now all my Bloods scream ""Soo-woo"" and ""Da-da-doe""
I know my role and I play it well
And I weigh it well, on my Libra scale
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy, leave it there
Long hair, don't even care

Young Carter, go farther, go further, go harder
Is that not why we came? And if not, then why bother?
Show no mercy in Murcielagos
I'm far from bein' the bastard that Marcy had fathered
Now my name's been mentioned with the martyrs
The Biggies and the Pacs and the Marleys and the Marcuses
Garvey; got me a molotov-cocktail flow
Even if you box well, can't stop the blows
Kaboom! The Roc Boy in the room
The dope boy I just came off the spoon
Also, I'm so fly I'm on auto-
Pilot, while guys just stare at my wardrobe
I see Euros, that's right: plural
I took so much change from this rap game, it's your go
(Hey Mr. Carter) Young!
It's my go, yeah… And I'ma go so opposite of soft
Off the richter, Hector, Camacho Man, Randy Savage
Far from average, above status–quo, flow so pro
I know, I ride slow, and when I pass
They say, ""What up, killa?"" Man, stop bringin' up my past
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z
Don't forget Weezy, Baby!

Hey, Mr. Carter (Amen)
Tell me, where have you been? (Yeah)

Hey, Mr. Carter
Tell me, where have you been?
Cause they've been asking, they've been searching

And I swear to everything, when I leave this Earth
It's gonna be on both feet, never knees in the dirt
And you can try me, fucker, but when I squeeze, it hurt
Fine, we'll lose two lives; yours and mine

Mic Check
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
Come through, dig the sound
I swear the whole world could feel you MC
Crowd around
I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
Hold mics like pony tails tight and bob a lot
Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
Of the fly brown 6-0 sicko psycho who throws his dick around
Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strapped
Femstat cats get kidnapped
Then release a statement to the press, let the rest know who did that
Metal Fist terrorists claim responsibility
Broken household name usually said in hostility
Um... what is MF? You silly
I'd like to take ""Mens to the End"" for two milli'
""Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!"" That's a audio daily double
Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
Watch your own back came in and go out alone, black
Stay in the zone—turn H2O to Cognac

One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
I'm trading science fiction with my man the live lifer
A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
Get out my face, askin' ‘bout my case, need toothpaste
Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent
And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
Real mens mind their own business
That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
How come I hold the microphone double-clutch
C.O.'s make rounds, never have ‘ox found
On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
On Doomsday!, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back where my brother went, that's what my tomb will say
Right above my government; Dumile
Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?

Doomsday, ever since the womb
‘Til I'm back to the essence, read it off the tomb
Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
Pass the mic like ""Pass the peas like they used to say""
Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
Nicknames off nipplin' tip of nipples metal fang
Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
Known amongst foes for flow without no talking orangutans
Only gin and Tang
Guzzled out a rusty tin can, me and this mic is like yin and yang
Clang! Crime don't pay, listen, youth
It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
Strong enough to please a wife
Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
Cut the crap far as rap
Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
What the Devil? He's on another level
It's a word! No, a name! MF - the Super-Villain!
Doomsday
To dig the sound
Crowd around
When I was led to you
I knew you were the one for me
I swear the whole world could feel you MC163Embed",https://images.genius.com/263743633b6e58854e753b25dca6beab.430x430x1.jpg

Admiring my style, tour bus through Manhattan

My hoes be the thickest, my dro the stickiest
Street nigga, stamped and bonafide
When beef jump niggas come get me cause they know I ride
True to the ski mask, New York's my origin

Hitting on many trees, feel real linen
Spitting on enemies, get the steel for tin men

Yeah don't wait for her man, don't wait for her
I'll tell you what man: come with me now and you know
I'll get you some lunch, I'll hook you up with something
I got a little bank, y'know, no problem
I hear you, that's cool (Alright? It's cool)
Man, can't you guys just wait here about a half hour, man?
Yo I'll be back man, I'm just gonna munch up a little bit man, I'm pretty hungry
Yo let him come back

Here you will find food for your body
As well as comfort for your troubled mind
I'd really like some soup (Bread and butter)
Of course my friend. What happened to your hand?
Oh, food at last!

How did they get here?
Regular storage procedure, the same as the other food

Thanks for the drink

Operation Doomsday complete
All your intercoms casualty and damage testing

Enough! You talk of the people's rights
The people have only those rights which I choose to give them
And that's for their own good, believe me
I do, DOOM
They disappoint me, they must work faster
But the prisoner-
Ah yes, the young traitor who has tried to turn my people against me
Watch him, I have special plans for that one

Beef rap, could lead to getting teeth capped
Or even a wreath for mom dukes on some grief crap
I suggest you change your diet
It can lead to high blood pressure if you fry it
Or even a stroke, heart attack, heart disease
It ain't no starting back once arteries start to squeeze
Take the easy way out phony, until then
They know they wouldn't be talking that bologna in the bullpen
So disgusting, pardon self as I discuss this
They talk a wealth of shit and they ain't never seen injustice
Bust this, like a cold milk from out the toilet
Two batteries, some Brillo and some foil, heat'll boil it
He be better off on PC glued
And it's a feud so don't be in no TV mood
Every week it's mystery meat, seaweed stewed
(Food, we need food!)
He wears a mask just to cover the raw flesh
A rather ugly brother with flows that's gorgeous
Drop dead joints hit the whips like bird shit
They need it like a hole in they head or a third tit
Her bra smell, his card say, ""Aw Hell!""
Barred from all bars and kicked out the Carvel
Keep a cooker where the jar fell
And keep a cheap hooker that's off the hook like Ma Bell
Top bleeding, maybe fella took the loaded rod gears
Stop feeding babies colored sugar-coated lard squares
The odd pair swears and God fears
Even when it's rotten, we've gotten through the hard years
I wrote this note around New Year's
Off a couple of shots and a few beers, but who cares?
Enough about me, it's about the beats
Not about the streets and who food he 'bout to eat
A rhyming cannibal who's dressed to kill and cynical
Whether is it animal, vegetable or mineral
It's a miracle how he get so lyrical
And proceed to move the crowd like a old negro spiritual
For a mil', do a commercial for Mello Yello
Tell them devils, ""Hell no, sell y'all own Jello""
We hollow krills, she swallow pills
He follow flea collar three dollar bills
And squealed for halal veal, if y'all appeal
Dig the real, it's how the big ballers deal
Twirl a L after every meal (""Food!"")
What up? To all rappers: shut up with your shutting up
And keep a shirt on, at least a button-up
Yuck, is they rhymers or strippin' males?
Out-of-work jerks since they shut down Chippendales
They chippin' nails, DOOM tippin' scales
Let alone the pre-orders that's counted off shippin' sales
This one goes out to all my peoples skippin' bail
Dippin' jail, whippin' tail and sippin' ale
Light the doobie 'til it glow like a ruby
After which, they couldn't find the Villain, like Scooby
He's in the lab on some old Buddha Monk shit
Overproof drunk shit, but who'd'a thunk it?
Punk, try and ask why ours be better
Could be the iron mask or the Cosby sweater

I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me, why shouldn't it be true?
I get a kick out of brew

There's only one beer left
Rappers screaming all in our ears like we're deaf
Tempt me, do a number on the label
Eat up all they emcees and drink 'em under the table
Like, ""It's on me, put it on my tab, kid""
However you get there, foot it, cab it, iron-horse it
You're leaving on your face, forfeit
I crush the mic, hold it like the heat, he might toss it
Told him tell 'em they stole it, he told her he lost it
She told him, ""Get off it,"" and a bunch of other more shit
Getting money, DT's be getting no new leads
It's like he eating watermelon: stay spitting new seeds
It's the weed, give me some of what he drooping off
Soon as he wake up, choking like it was whooping cough
They group been soft
First hour at the open bar and they're trooping off
He went to go laugh and get some head by the side road
She asked him autograph her derriere, it read:
""To Wide Load, this yardbird taste like fried toad turd
Love, Villain""—take pride in code words
Crooked eye, mold, nerd, geek with a cold heart
Probably still be speaking in rhymes as an old fart
Study how to eat to die by the pizza guy
No, he's not too fly to skeet in a skeezer eye
And squeeze her thigh, maybe give her curves a feel
The same way she feel it when he flow with nerves of steel
They call the super when they need their back—uh, plumbing fixed
""How is only one left? The pack comes in six!
Whatever happened to two and three?""
A herb tried to slide with four and five
And got caught like, ""What you doing, G?
Don't make him have to get cutting like truancy
Matter fact, not for nothing, right now, you and me!""
Looser than a pair of Adidas
I hope you brought your spare tweeters
MCs sound like cheerleaders
Rapping and dancing like Red Head Kingpin
DOOM came to do the thing again, no matter who be blingin'
He do it for the smelly hubbies
Seeds know what time it is like it's time for ""Teletubbies""
Few can do it, even fewer can sell it
Take it from the dude who wear a mask like a 'tarded helmet
He plots shows like robberies:
""In and out, one, two, three—no bodies, please!
Run the cash and you won't get a wet sweatshirt
The mic is the shotty: nobody move, nobody get hurt
Bring heat like the boy done gone to war
He came in the door and, 'Everybody on the floor!'

Keep your hoes in check

I told her I'd come scoop her around eight, she said, ""Super!
That sounds great!"" Shorty girl's a trooper
No matter what I need her to do, she be like, ""Super!""
Own his own throne, the boss like King Koopa
On the microphone he flossed the ring ""Super!""
Average emcees is like a TV blooper
MF DOOM, he's like D.B. Cooper
Out with the moolah, I let her get a outfit
Just to cool her off, she said, ""Niggas ain't about shit""
I wonder if she meant it, I doubt it
The way it be in her mouth she can't live without it
And can't live with this, handle your business
Villain'll stay on a scandalous ho's shit list
One pack of cookies, please, Mr. Hooper
It's fun smacking rookies, he is the ""Super!""
Look like a Black Wookiee when he let his beard grow
Weirdo, brown-skinned'd, always kept his hair low
Rumors has it it's a S-Curl accident
DOOM was always known to keep the best girls' backs bent
Some say it's the eyes, some say the accent
A lot of guys wonder where they stacks went
I call her Thunder-Thighs with the fatty swoll-uh
Only mess with high rollers, do what Daddy told her
No matter the city she with me to do the thang-thang
Work in the coochie, hoopty chitty-chitty bang-bang
Same name on the titty as on the name ring
Pretty like Baby D off ""All in the Same Gang""
Keep my eye on her, really don't trust her
But I treat her like a daughter, taught her how to bust a nut
And the heat to turn beef to horsemeat chalupa
Teach her how to hold it, of course, he is the ""Super!""
See, most cats treat her like Foofur
Or beat her to a stupor, take it from the ""Super!""
You need to make her feel cuter
And lay down the G like Luther, everything'll be ""Super!""
Do for her, keep her in a new fur
So she look sweet when she go to meet the ""Super!""
Got the buddha get the Grenadiers, twist it
Put it in the air, come here, kiss it
Listen here scooter, let her try to bag you
When she's on the rag, never let her fry the ragù
Which'll have you under some type of spell crying, ""Dag, boo""
Her name on your back in a tattoo
Whether a bougie broad, nerd ho, street chick
Don't call her Wifey if you met her at the Freaknik
You don't want her don't waste her time, I'll duke her
And be a father to your child like the ""Super!""
He keep his hoes in check
Sends 'em out to get glows from off frozen necks
Tell 'em, ""Take his clothes, leave him posing naked for real
Better yet, get him for the check off the record deal
Find out where he keep the Tec and the blue steel
Make sure for extra wreck, let him know how you feel

Auditioning morticians, saw it in a vision, ignoring prison
Ignoramuses enlist and sound dumb
Found 'em drowned in cow's dung, crowns flung
Rings a Tinkerbell, sing for things that's frail as a fingernail
Bring a scale, stale ginger lingers

Lecture on removal of the bowels, foul technically
Don't expect to see the recipe
Until we receive the check as well as the collection fee
More wreck than Section Z, what you expect to get for free?

Before we go any further
Friends

As you call 'em, they call you when they need something
Trees for the bluntin', to G's for the frontin'
I found a way to get peace of mind for years and left the hell alone
Turn a deaf ear to the cellular phone
Send me a letter or better, we could see each other in real life
Just so you could feel me like a steel knife
At least so you could see the white of they eyes
Bright with surprise, once they finish spitting lies
Associates, is your boys, your girls, bitches, niggas, homies
Close, or really don't know me
Mom, dad, comrade, peeps, brothers, sisters, duns, dunnies
Some come around when they need some money
Others make us laugh like the Sunday funnies
Fam be around whether you paid or bummy
You could either ignore this advice or take it from me:
Be too nice and people take you for a dummy
So nowadays, he ain't so friendly
Actually they wouldn’t even made a worthy enemy
Read the signs: ""No feeding the baboons""
Seein' as how they got ya back bleeding from the stab wounds
Y'all know the dance, they smile in ya face, y'all know the glance
Try to put 'em on, they blow the chance
Never let your so-called mans know your plans
(How many of us have them?) A show of hands
(Friends) is a term some people use loosely
I'm real choosy on what I choose to let crew see
You telling me I try to act broke
Jealousy the number one killer among black folk
Fellas be under some type of spell like crack smoke
Ghetto Cinderellas lead 'em right to your stack, loc
Just another way a chick'll lead to your end
I checked the dictionary for the meaning of friend
It said: ""person one likes to socialize with
Sympathizer, helper"", and that's about the size of it
Most of the time these attributes is one-sided
To bolster the crime, they're apt to shoot you through your eyelid
And they can't hide it, going wild like a white bitch
Sometimes ya need to cut niggas off like a light switch
(Flick!) And when things get quiet
Catch 'em like a thief in the night, what a riot
I first met Mr. Fantastik at a arms deal
Don't let it get drastic, think of how your moms'll feel
When it get for real, steel get to sparkin'
Everything darken, it ain't no talkin'
For somethin' so cheap, it sure buys a lot of trouble
Ya better off focusing than tryin' to plot to bubble
Or else it'd be a sad note to end on, the guns we got is
(One's we can depend on, friends)
Some come in the form of co-dependents
A lot of times only end up being co-defendants
Ten bucks say they tell for a lower sentence
And leave you up under the jail, begging for repentance
It don't make no sense, what happened to the loyalty?
Honor amongst crooks, trust among royalty
I'd rather go out in a blaze than give 'em the glory
(How many of us have—) a similar story?
(Friends) before lovers, we used to have some type of over-standing
Just so when I let her get the man thing
She know it's no strings, we could do the damn thing
But ho, it's no rings, just how the tramp swings
Will she see him again? That depends on
""How good was the skins?"" and ""Could she memorize the lessons?""
It ain't no need to pretend
Even though she let him stab it, she know they're just friends

I first met DOOM years ago
When he wanted to be alone, alone to pursue his forbidden experiments
One day while conducting a secret experiment
 Later, when he recovered from his injuries
Instead of having learned his lesson, DOOM was bitter, angry, vengeful
 What have I done to myself?
My face, it is hideous
He traveled the world, seeking a cure for his disfigured face
(I’m sorry sir, there is nothing we can do for you)
He traveled through remote villages, where strangers are seldom seen
He continued his search, never showing his face

I strive to be humble, lest I stumble
Never sold a jumbo or copped chicken with its mumbo
Sauce, Tyson is a fowl holocaust
Hitler gassed your whole head up with poultry, I'm fed up
Ignore cordon bleu, stand up, get up
Lunge for your knife, don't forget your potholders
(Hot shit)

What, these old things? About to throw 'em away
With the gold rings that make 'em don't fit like OJ
Usually I take them off with Oil of Olay
MCs is crabs in a barrel, pass the Old Bay
Hot as hell and it's a cold day, innit?
Working on a way that we can roll away tinted
Some say the price of holding heat is often too high
You either be in a coffin or you be the new guy
The one that's too fly to eat shoo pie
Never too busy when it comes down to you and I
(Swear to God) A lot of niggas wish to die
They need to hold they horses, there's bigger fish to fry
You're on the list, if not, pick a number spot
Ten and a half Timbs is made to kick your bumba claat
I coulda had a V-8
F-150 quad cab but I'll be straight
Money comes and goes like that two bit hussy
That night that tried to rush me, Dwight, pass the dutchie
So I can calm down so they don't get it twisted
Take it from the fire side, it won't get blistered
Got it, what happened? Oh, it's not lit

Born under a bad sign, I'm serious about this curse of mine
I strive to flip it into fine wine
""Barely born a virgin"" is what the stars said
Black not white, red all over, though, like Elmo
Twenty-eight years have passed, I feel I'm peaking
I make music every weekend
It's a chore, a fact of life, a labor of love
I get mad love, but I detest the labor
And its wages—you know, death?

Won't stop rockin' til he clocked in a gazillion grand
Tillin' the wasteland sands
Raps on backs of treasure maps, stacks to the ceilin' fan
He rest when he's ashes
Ask 'em after ten miles in his galoshes, smashes stashes
Chip on his shoulder with a slip on holster
A clip, a folder and his grip on a boulder bolster
They supposed to know, it show when his aura glow
Get from out the row, when he get dough, it's horrible
Time is money, spend, waste, save, invest the fess
For ten K's, he'll cave a chicken chest S
Yes, y'all, the dub will get you trickles
The best ballers pitch in and rub together nickels
But, tut-tut, he 'bout to change the price again
It go up each time he blow up like hydrogen
Villain here, have 'em shrillin' in fear
And won't stop top illin' 'til he a gazillionaire
Grillin' stare, yeah, your boy had drama
Got 'em on a mental plane, avoided bad karma
Once sold an inbred skinhead a nigga joke
Plus a brand-new chrome smoker with the triggers broke
I thought I told 'em, ""Firing pins was separate""
He find out later when he tries to go and rep it
Took a Jehovah money for a Arabic Torah
Charged in advance to translate it and ignored her, sorta
One monkey don't stop no slaughter
A junkie wanna cop a quarter-ton, run for the border

Fill it to the rim like brim

It's not meant for the seein'
Went through the ceilin' after enterin' his center bein'

Who do a duet jam when Ernest goes to camp
For the right earn, na'mean? Like Vern
We need some more oil for the machines to burn, learn

He gets lucky like winnin' free tickets off sickly lyrics
One man's waste is another man's soap
Son's fanbase know the brother-man's dope
A real weirdo with a bugged, rare flow
And the way his hair grow was ugly as a scarecrow
He wears a mask so the charge won't grab
On a rooftop with a large stone slab
Heads up, talk white and thought niggerish
Refuse to walk tight and got his off the vigorish
Black licorice and equally as yucky
How he handled the money was strictly Dan Stuckie
Monkey hustle, man on fire
Later for the date than the Hadron Collider
And cost more, it be seemin' like a style
DOOM leave the competition steamin' like a pile
Smile (ding!) Sparklin' jewels
In effect like alternate side of the street parkin' rules
Fools, the roach was never dead
Live for a week, then dehydrate with a severed head

It's the beat (DOOM), he hear it in his sleep sometimes
Blare it in your jeep so your peoples can stare at them rhymes
Real rhymes not your everyday hologram
Even when ribs was touchin', never swallowed the ham
He'd rather eat a sand sandwich salad
It might need salt like your man's bland ballad
A lot of stuff happens that the news won't tell you's
Blues on L juice, snooze, all hell loose
Rake it, take it like the good, the bad, the ugly
Break it, rollin' through ya hood in the caddy buggy
Butter softy, leather flossy, fatty juggy
Always threw me off when she told me, ""Daddy, funk me""
I'm like, ""Anywho's""
Seeds walkin' all out in the street without any shoes
I guess it's better than some funky socks
You need to get her some skips before she catch the monkey pox (Hahahahaha)
Instead she wanna hear the beatbox
Take pills and make fake krills as sheetrock
Sing it, bring it back to your laboratory
While he's in his oratory, glory, it's like a horror story
The mask is like Jason
They told the place not to let the basket type case in
He could be some kind of wacko
Waitin' for the chance to heat the pipes like a crack ho
He busted in, blessed be the Lord
Who believe any mess they read up on a message board
If so, I got bridges for the low low
Same bitch a-go dry snitchin' to the popo
Here, orange peel stogs for the whole tier
Feel like I've been gone over a year, came home to old gear
It was the shit when I first scooped it
At least I get to sit out in New York and curse stupid
Plead the fifth, sip wine stiffly
Patiently come up and be spiffy in a jiffy
Gift for the grind, criminal mind shifty
Swift with the nine through a fifty nine fifty
Well edumacated, he heard it when he meditated 9n deep theta
Let her hate, the creep played her
Dedicated cheap skata who keeps data
Say he stay self medicated to sleep later
Side effects is similar to sugar pill
Whoever go next on the mic he put a booger, ill
And made his exit on some calm shit
Begged him on the regular for kegs of more vomitspit

One more beer
And I'll take you all

Banned from all bars
The man with seven scars

Smack it up, flip it, pulled out, 'bout to fell
Sunday in the ATL and I'm all outta ale
Like a bat out of hell, tripped on a cat tail
Mutt drinkin out a pail, who let the rat out the cell?
Got all the ingredients and recipe, might as well
Since last week, the bootlegger been in jail
If all else fail, inhale the L
Makin' sure they can't see your sale via snail mail
Mind like a sewer, servin' rhyme on a skewer
DOOM'll step to a fine dime like he knew her
""My black sister!"" She said, ""Step back!"" before he kissed her
She did the dipper and the smack just missed her
There go a list of politics like Henry Kissinger
99% of rap's just a friendly listener
I'm like, ""These dudes must have some screws loose to hate y'all""
Or a couple of ounces short of deuce-deuce or 8 Ball
Y'all know it's time for the end when the day come
Buy a album, get rudely insulted over fake drums
Same CDs you get for free, you break 'em
Wa-alaikum, make 'em eat they food like Steak-umm
Why she wanna ask me if I could pass the paprika?
One hand on the mic, the other on the beaker
Every week or so, peeked out the lab though, eureka!
A technique to keep somethin' uniquer in ya speaker

My servants began to forge what was to become the most dreaded costume on the face of the earth. The last thing to fit was the mask. Would it conform to my twisted features in comfort?

He cleans his metal mask with gasoline, they after him
Last seen pulling chicks like a fiend pull a fast one
Can't put shit past him
Got niggas on his own team mad enough to blast him
Retarded in real life, on the mic Rain Man
Stand close to his main man like a chain gang
Who give a fuck about who or they fancy crew
That's no mystery, like Hardy Boys do with Nancy Drew
Saw her with her drawers down, caught her
The extorter bring slaughter like ""Well I oughta""
I suggest you hand over the formula, 'dullah
A villain in your land, in his land a ruler
Hard hitting like puffing a woolah with Lieutenant Uhura
Every day feel like it's an off day with Ferris Bueller
Brother pull heat to prove they not sweet
No matter how you spell it, we still got beats

Don't question how we live, question what we give
Take it to the next leave 'em where they can't see me
Still they judge, but they be butt ass
Twist that wig like a muppet, keep it simple, can't truss it
Light's the fuel, mic is the tool
Drink Jack, kick back, drop jewel, finish what I start
Mastered the art, living hell can't explain it
Inhale confuse it more, cop the .44

It's horrible
One little evening alone, home
End up with carpal tunnel syndrome
And here I am, known for giving heavy back aches
Grown and living off of Little Debbie snack cakes
Supposed to be checking emails
All I got is messages from ass naked females
I don't know a Jenny
She said it's free and I won't owe her a penny
And that's the last time I saw her
But thousands of more horrors on online Gomorrah
And Sodom, they got 'em with they curls out
And they got a better sales pitch than the Girl Scouts
I wonder what I owe her
For a whole box of caramel coconut samoa

Now it's time to get serious like Peek Freans
A metal handful, wipe it on the quilt
Wife wake up and I'm kill't over spilt milk
Locked in, looking at your picture
Fully clothed winter and I'm right there with ya
Thinking about the last time I split your wishbone
A man could only wish you do the same 'til he get home
Fat chance, at least he get snacks
That'd have to do 'til a brother get back
Until then smack One-Eyed Jack
And hope one of his peoples can hook him with a tri-pack
That's three different flavors
Chocolate, vanilla and strawberry wafers
Acting all hard, 'bout to get beat up
I'll show him what time it is once I get this sheet up
Soon as he fell off the beat down
All I hear is, ""13th cell, put the sheet down""

Besides the fact she wanna get dug out on the d-low
A workaholic with a fountain in the ink pen
Out in the mountains and I stopped drinking again
In the wee hours, he's gotten farther
Needing three showers, being hot and bothered
The wiz with her legs bent, pregnant
God bless the day she wondered where her egg went
I need a L, it's hard to drink without it

And heat it like beef patty, coco bread con queso
If you say so, lace the whole case load
They say he wear a metal mask in case his face show
He told 'em they flows is bitch talk and ayo's
His whole crew walk with pitchfork and halos
Say ho if you never worked a J-O
And keep more cash in a stash than a peso
Okay, yo, y'all know who to follow
Tie 'em up in the crib and leave they place hollow
Oh, shoot, the goose she's loose
So wild you couldn't chase it down with straight fruit juice
Frown like the first time you taste couscous
Stash the deuce deuce, troops askin' ""truce, truce""
Today on intense wreck week
We have the Supervillain in his own defense to speak
It's all part of my mental techniques
Available to freaks and pencil-neck geeks
Train a sane brain to an insane train of thought
On a campaign trail he came to gain your support
Charge cash for a autograph
Say some shit to make your daughter laugh, then slaughter the ass
See 'em on the big screen like Steve McQueen
Do somethin' and never be back once he leaves the scene
Keep more medicated pads than Stridex
For his own side wreck with no known side effects
Before you press charges use your noodle
So what when he grab the mic he crush your cute cuticles
Keep your mouth shut, everything will be beautiful
It would be awfully rude to you, now get back to your hooty hoo
Damn it, it ain't worth the drama, can it
From the calm bandit, eat rhymers like pomegranate
Soon as he stepped in he lit the room
Boom, reschedule my noon with Brit Hume
(DOOM!) In love with Mary Jane, she's my main thing
Pulled her right from that web head, what a lame brain
Maintain and say it, don't spray it
You wanna see your girl again, you might as well pay it
If I had a dime for every rhymer's that bust guns
I'd have a cool mil' for my sons in trust funds
When I was broker than a broke dick dog
I always kept a L to smoke in thick fog
When it rain, it sure do thunderstorm
I got more rhymes in the summer than musty underarms
One, two, microphone checker
First learned to neck off a Home Ec homewrecker
This is back when he was like crib age
When he hit the stage, it's like a gauge to the rib cage
Break the mic like a rock star break a guitar
And jump off the stage like ""Yee haw!""

Metal Face DOOM
Operation Doomsday
You were very high
By the way, I re-up on bad dreams, bag up screams in fiftys
Be up on mad schemes that heat shop like jiffy (Pop-pop!)
In a instant, get smoked like Winston Cigarettes
Hoes get ripped off like Nicorette (Patch)
In real life, the real trife scene
Might snatch ya life like assault machine
Rifle, dead-up, setup like bull-fight
Be blunted how we like couldn't white, or in full flight
The unemotional, call me anti-social
On the run, off the gun death tally commercial
Death Valley is like rehearsal to the streets, to my peeps
GM, MF on the beat
Rhymes is chosen like the weapons of war
So keep from steppin' on my floor or delivery front-door
I bring it to ya'll motherfuckers, master yours
My disaster cause.. Hell, in gas drawls
The supervillain cooler than a million, I be chillin'
Still quick to slice squares like Sicilians
Don't make me have to hurt them feelings
I'll ruin you in the dirt that I be doin' in my dealings
(While I'm) Sendin' spirits through the ceilin', chrome peelin'
Dome blown within the comforts of your own home
Grown big, wheelin' and high rollin'

Posin', chest and legs open, couldn’t stand worse
All was missin' was a bandana and a man purse
Cryin', dyin', laughin' 'til glands burst
Faster than a speeding glass, bleeding-ass ran first
Fixin' baby hair, messed up wavy curl
Under the cape the back of the S say baby girl
The things some people‘ll do for fame

You can keep your hero and hold the meatballs
Worthy title, lock it with pockets on empty

Amazed at all these so-called wannabe players

Met a brother from the grill that gave my spine chills
All thirty three nerves, controlling my curves
Common sense just swerved every time I got served
Stress, frustration, empty rhetoric
Cold as winter in Connecticut, compassion lacking deficit
Thought it was love like, sent from above, you not a soulmate
More ways and actions of a primate
Who by low and census coming faker than extensions
Pissed away all good intentions, outta here sister was missin'
Intuition, maybe it was me, I couldn't see
Holding onto fantasy, getting bitten by reality

War wound, purple heart, love veteran
Morphine, pain killers, drugs and medicine
Anything just to forget the hurt

I remember when, last past November when
Clown kid got pounded in with the Timberlands
They left him trembling, he was not remembering:
Never tuck your denim in just to floss an emblem
Some would debate, ""Wait, the fella ate gelatin
Or he been listening in to what his weathermens was telling him""
When I could feel it in my melanin, it's compelling
Us to break them off, no reassembling
No science-fiction to no theater near you, coming soon to
Fuck with you frequently like how phases of the moon would do
You could gather 'round like it was an eclipse
Just don't look directly to the bitch, you may be blinded by the scripts
Pass the L, the last to tussle in them shirttails
All hail, King Geedorah, the third rail
700 volts holds rap to a standstill
Fool ignore the rule, fuck up and get his man killed
Two bottles of Dom got his hands filled
And so goes the days of our lives as the hourglass sand spill
And built with Passion and a glass of the 'Ze
(And the lights went down and hey!)

And I knew it was the last day - Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reason
Mostly with these crimes of treason

He's the villain with the million dollar voice-throw trick
He's like a ventriloquist, with his fist in the speaker's back
Couldn't think of no uniquer track, nope, sneak attack
It don't really matter how big them is. So much as a nipple
Cause you could have a chick with D-Triple
'Cept the nipple little, just hot off the griddle
Like how he do monkey rhymers, like Monkey-in-the-Middle by his damn self
Ain't no average MC ahead of me
Getting cheddar instead of the probably better pedigree
With nicknames, sick games as Rick James
Messy games, Sci.Fly such as Jesse James
Blast, I figure, ass-hawking ass titty licker
Last one to walk up in, fast-talking city slicker
Got bagged cause of the dirty chick with make-up
Bail out quick for the 7:30 wake-up
My only backup was an A-cup, as far as May
To when the leaves turn red and gold to Nimrod earthday
All else? Worthless to say

That's when I knew it was the first day - Wig-Twisting Season
When some could get their wigs twisted back within reasoning

I been bent back since my Physical went back
Since, Cultured more of my kin
And for them I keep an L rolled in this hellhole

In the worsest way, soon as the leaves show red and gold
To 'round Nimrod release day
And all else? Needless to say
Wait a motherfucking minute! True facts presented
The names was probably changed just to protect who ain't in it

The way his shit was twisted? Ask him if it hurted

Sorta like Squidward and his clarinet
I'm in ya bitch mouth, but she fantasizing
Staring at the skinnies, said it's so tantalizing
Dog, I'm strategizing, plotting on the throne
Master of the ace, sitting on chrome
Dark nights tryna sleep, stomach on fire
Delusional from hunger, so I couldn't get tired
Imagining the equalizer goin' from green to red
Words that rhyme together just appear all in my head
And I'm sorta like Neo with the Matrix code
Try to escape it, hoping the drugs'll numb my soul
Say I'm getting old, time's running out
Repeating instrumentals, tryna figure patterns out
I never leave the house, ain't slept in three days
Poppin' pills, writin', drinkin' and smokin' haze
Weavin' kicks and snares, tryna dodge these hooks
Keepin' it original, something that's overlooked
The way a nigga goin', might go out like Sam Cooke
Or locked up, callin' home for money on my books
'Cause if this shit don't work, nigga, I failed at life
Turning to these drugs, now these drugs turned my life
And it's the downward spiral, got me suicidal
But too scared to do it, so these pills'll be the rifle
Surpassing all my idols, took the wrong turn
But can't go back now, so let that blunt burn
'Cause now it's my turn if I fuck it all up

Now I spit a 16 straight with no punch
Remember all for dinner all we ate was Captain Crunch
Now we blow big blunts on the way to brunch
Went from good fella to commissary slips
Now I got back up man every time I slipped
Never ever quit, I just kept on pursuing
Teacher always ask me, what was I doing
Scribbled in my notebook and never did homework
Low attention span, guess these Adderall worked
Rocked Tommy Hil shirts, ones with the boat
Rockport kicks way before we even smoked
Used to have baby lungs, choking when I hit it
Nowadays lace a whole seven in a sitting
Remember back then, man we thought we growed up
Rushin' out of kid just to be grown up

Rushing as a kid just to be grown up
Yeah, whoever thought I'd be the greatest growing up?

I can eat a pound and shit sixty four quarters
Burn up fire and drown drops of water
Son, I told you I got them beans like Goya
Gone off them pills, got me jumping off the sofa
Hotter than a Hot Pocket out the devil microwave
Model bitches begging just be a nigga sex slave
Exotic foreign garments lookin' tailor made
And when these bitches see me man, they wetter than the Everglades
Everyday same shit, me getting paid
Waking up, new bitch, me getting laid
Used to take bottle back, waitress bring the bottle back
Now they see me shining and they looking like a Sour Patch

So much coke just to sniff, need a ski lift
Flip your table over if you cut it with the bullshit
Nosebleed on red carpets, but it just blend in
Snapping pictures feeling my chest being sunk in
Live a fast life, seen many die slowly
Unhappy when they left so I try to seize the moment

Funny how it happens who ever would imagine
That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?

I can sell honey to a bee
In the fall time, make trees, take back they leaves
Octopus in a straight jacket, savage with bad habits
Broke, serving fiends, got rich, became a addict
Ain't it funny how it happens, who would ever would imagine
Nose running right now, could ya pass me a napkin?
Managed to somehow to have the upper advantage
Panic when the drugs are gone and nobody is answering
Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it, ain't it funny how it happens?
No way to mask it, a lot became has beens
Rolling up that hundred dollar bill till they cash in
Thinks it gone last, going too fast
Man, it's fucked up, ain't it funny how it happens?

Ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?
Ain't it? ain't it funny how it happens?

Ain't it funny how it happens? Upcoming heavy traffic
Say ya need to slow down 'cause you feel yourself crashing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
Staring in the devil face but ya can't stop laughing
It's a living nightmare, that most of us might share
Inherited in our blood, it's why we stuck in the mud
Can’t quit the drug use or the alcohol abuse
Even if I wanted to, tell you what I'm gonna do
I’ma wash away my problems with this bottle of Henny
Anxiety got the best of me so I'm popping them Xannies
Might need rehab but to me that shit pussy
Pray for me y'all 'cause I don't know what coming to me
Bought a 8-ball of coke and my nigga on the way
Got three hoes with him and they all tryna play
Funny how it happens who ever would imagine
That joke's on you but Satan the one laughing

Ain't it funny how it happens?

Ain't gonna be too many suckers, and furthermore, I think you better check your mitts
Jay, come on, baby, let's cut this place loose
Yeah, chump, you better get the fuck out of here
And take your bitches with you, especially Ug-Mug here

The Hybrid, smoking on papaya
That give you niggas bronchitis, what you write is all vagina
What I write is Wall of China, nigga, that's great
Like eighths of Grape Apes gettin' stuffed in my suitcase
Ready to hit the studio and shit all on your mixtape
Nah, literally, shit all on your mixtape
Wipe with the credits, leave stains on the jewel case
In just two takes, dog, the booth'll get souffléd
You're hiding something like a toupée
Truthfully, my friend, touché
You gon' get exposed like an up-and-coming model
And to me, your label seems like one of them pageant mamas
So guess who's the little bitch? That's you
You must suck a lot of dick, that's true
I misuse with issues and pistols
Mind racing like Bristol, heart of igloos
My nigga, you ain't been what I been through
And if so, you would take a pencil through your temple
'Cause I done served fiends on they menstrual
Ain't even had pads, stuffed they panties with tissue
Hit the ave 'cause they mouth ain't bleeding
And your style's like fried chicken without seasoning
Nigga, that's bland, fuck you up and your mans
I smack you like a bitch, nigga, that's open-hand
Fuck you and your tough talk
When I monopolize, I throw your ass off the boardwalk
Fag, you ain't play sports, but always at the ballpark
Type of nigga rocking Crocs at the fuckin' Walmart
Drunk like Stallworth, riding in a fiend car
Get flicked, guess what? I'm runnin' from this fiend car
I know a nigga dirty and got the hammer
But this kush got me high like Pac bandanna

That's why these white bitches wanna get with him
I smack it, flip it like Mike Bivins
But to me, your flow's like Ronny DeVoe's
My hoes got toes in expensive high heels
Your hoes' toes is fucked, beauty supply sandals

25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living
25 bucks, momma braid your hair
Sit on the porch, she'll do it on the stairs
Grew your hair out and you wanna get it twisted
Fed us many nights, nigga, that's how we was living

I'll not get old
If I dig with my knees, if I grind down my teeth
I know from the attic of me
From the bottoms of pleas, from the waywarded seas

Arthritis in her fingers, carpal tunnel in her wrists
'Bout to feed her kids at night, sit between her legs and twist
While she listen to the oldies, soap operas, smoking bogies
On the phone, gossiping, telling homegirls stories
Girlfriend worried 'cause her son's in a hurry
To see the state pen' or a cemetery buried
Ma replied, do her best, but it's still rough
Keep your kids off the street and away from drugs
Doing hair in the house, ain't putting on Daniel
Daddy in and out: ""Ayy, who turned that channel?""
Sneakers turn to house shoes, stepping on the back
Ashing her cigarette in a brown paper bag
Smoking joints, laughing, tryna get the part straight
For ten, put your perm in, don't scratch all day
Hot cocoa stove, put the food in the bowl
Say that's how many nights it was hard to keep going

If you really balling, mommy cop Chinese food
If you really wonder why these people got issues
'Cause the rent owed and the fucking lights due
On her knees at night, pray a miracle come through
Daddy shooting Craps, tryna win a pair of shoes
I been growing my hair, 'bout to let mommy twist it
Out wilding with my friends, even got myself a biscuit
Homie momma smoking with nothing to lose
Now he stashing cracks in some hundred-dollar shoes
Sitting at his crib, smoking Swishers, getting faded
Told me hit my mommy up, 'cause he tryna get braided
What we gon' do? See the local dopeman
See if he can put some money in our hand
Same one jump me, the same one front me
'Cause I'm tired of seeing my family fucked up and hungry

Now I'm in the trap and the devil ain't forgetting

And employed by none other than them fools with the gold
And them bankrolls explode
And your bitch in my target when I shoot my load
Bullseye, my eyes tie-dyed
Fried off the same shit that rockstars died from
Smoke somethin' with your man, bitch
Like Wyclef, used to sell the cannabis
Manuscript, sick shit, prescription addiction
Sniffin' Adderall off the counter in my kitchen
Trippin' off the shit that had Brian Wilson flipping
Experiment so much, it's a miracle I'm livin'

So step inside the mind that revolves around the rhyme
And every time he close his eyes, visions of white lines

Don't know her name, but the paramedics chest pumpin'
Thirty-something Black male OD'd off of pills
That he weren't prescribed, but they took his life
Left behind a daughter that don't really even know him
'Cause her mama thought he wouldn't make a living off of poems
But it was a long journey on a rocky road
Had a hoodie on and a jacket in the snow
Walkin' in the cold on the way to the studio

Dropped a couple mixtapes on the 'net
Niggas tried to front like I wasn't all that
But guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Guess what, bitch? I'm coming back
Signed to Fool's Gold, now everything is all gnarly
Now these bitches want my number to get up in the party
Came a long way from extension cords in the window
Borrow neighbor's power just to plug up the Nintendo
Where the oven's never closed and the stove's never off
Every winter so cold, niggas sleepin' wearing scarf
But I always tell myself that it's gon' get better
You know who you is? You the greatest rapper ever
So now the pressure's on to prove that voice right
Some people never knew they goals, knew mine my whole life
So now his turn's up, fixin' up to bat
Pitchin' singles to the label when I used to pitch crack
I never learned to rap, always knew how
Ever since a nigga eight, knew what I would do now
When I turned twenty-eight, they like, ""What you gon' do now?""
And now a nigga thirty, so I don't think they heard me
That the last ten years, I been so fucking stressed

Close my eyes, feel like I'm going down in an elevator at 90 miles an hour
And all I see is stars and they coming at me sort of like a meteor shower
Said, my forehead's sweaty, my eyelids heavy, feeling like I ain't going make it
Cause inside my head's like a firework show in the 4th July in Las Vegas
Said, I'm tripping, I'm slipping, feeling like I just can't move
I done took me a couple more pills
Next thing I know, I'm taking off my shoes
Said, I'm on walking on these clouds like marshmallows
Nodding off, smelling like rose petals
Zoning out, two-three, like the fiend in hell fire and angel wings
I'm conscious to that world, connin science 'bout that world
All these drugs up in me, it's a miracle I ain't mirror Kurt
I'm numb like a mortician, going dumb with Oakland bitches
They say you hella boosie, roll a backwood up with them cookies

Street smart, Ph.D
Dropped out for a slanging degree
9 on me, keep the devils off me
'Cause we was living in hell, couldn't afford property
Lil nigga gettin' frontin' from OGs
Oz of reggie bagged up in the Pelle
In a school hallways on a burnout celly
Leaving out of class early, caught a sale for 20
How long will it last?
Never ending race, chasin' cash
One lane going wrong way 'til I crash
Teacher find my sack, going nowhere fast

Tell me what I don't know
Last night homie got killed at the liquor store
Shot my nigga on the way to get a Swisher
Breaking down the weed when the call got received

We was so ambitious
All we really wanted was new Jordans and some bitches
Flashing bankrolls in the club taking pictures
Thinking we was grown men, really lil' niggas
Jumping dope fiends that's owing us for credit
Taking turns catching sales things copacetic
Slice your tomato if you owe us for the lettuce
Running through the sack of D sorta like Jerome Bettis
Naive to the outcome
Cuz hit the block, hit the stash and they found some
Lock us all up for a bag and some pistols
Now we in the county writing letters I miss you

Bounce that ass for that pussy, got a appetite
Geeked up, geeked up, pop a pill just like Mike and Ikes

I'm sweating like I’m in a rave
Been in this room for 3 days
Think I’m hearing voices
Paranoid and think I’m seeing ghost-es, oh shit
Phone keep ringing but I cut that shit off
Only time I use it when I tell the dealer drop it off
Had a threesome last night, ain’t matter what it cost
Couldn’t it get hard, tried to stuff it in soft
Had to fuck em both raw, keep my fingers crossed
Been grinding on my teeth so long it's swelling up my jaw
Nothing on but my bathrobe and pinky ring
Your worst nightmare for me is a normal dream
And if I learned anything
Is don’t nod off with ya motherfucking cigarette burning
Knocking on my door but I won’t answer
Residue on mirrors, Jojo dancer

And it's a downward spiral

Hennessy straight got my chest like a furnace
Drowning frustrations in a ocean of sin
Thinking irrational, I have no emotions
Cold cold world, some might say
Freezing on the snow, brain feel a bit frostbit
Nauseous, don’t know the last time I ate
But I eat these fucking rappers like fucking last steak
On death row, feel like I am

So I put it all up in these songs...

In the Caddy Ron Isley on between in the sheets
And a way a nigga work make a grip in a week

Sniff a gram and a half
Plus her pussy juicier than Shalamar curl bag
While she draw me a bath
Roll a blunt then passed
Jiggled and giggled her booty
Couldn’t do nothing but laugh
Credit cards separating
White lines on a mirror
Roll a 100 dollar bill

Flat screen porn on
Watching Asa Akira
Nothing on but my pinky ring
Sniff when I get up
On the balcony drunk

Put that thang in her caboose
Only way you hang is with a noose

Hanging with the devil off angel dust
For that money, in God we trust
All fall victim for greed and lust
Who you 'pose to trust when guns gone bust?

Just waking up, feelin' like a sin
Gotta keep a eye on your friends
Cause everybody hungry in them streets
Nigga rob ya grandma for something to eat
Know it's fucked up, that's how it be
Growing up living everyday in the D

Made a sculpture of me, but my dick was too thin
Paint pictures of me, but they never get my chin
One writing scriptures, bringing tears to the princess
Every time I indent, you can see the intent
Leave your mind bent, hanging onto every sentence
Have no apprentice, style uninherited
Laughing at you peasants 'cause my penmanship is excellence
Whenever in the presence, eyes get wide
I'm the town hero 'cause my words give 'em pride
And what they feel inside, I say the perfect words for
Some say I'm a prophet with the visions I get cursed for
Leave 'em all astonished, ride with the verbs
Make a grown man cry with strength of the words

Tears to Mona Lisa, Medusa to liquid
Flow can make Gandhi grab the burner, wanna shoot shit
Rhymes that'll make the Pope wanna get his dick sucked
Have Virgin Mary doing lines in the pickup
Make Sarah Palin deepthroat 'til she hiccup

Dearly departed, it's done when it started
So now that I'm livin' so harmonious (Harmonious)
Feelin' like Spartacus, Curry the ultimate
I am the best, there's no politics
Bitch, I'm ultimate
Ultimate
Bitch, I'm

I am the one, don't weigh a ton
Don't need a gun to get respect up on the street (Okay)
Under the sun, the bastard son
Will pop the Glock to feed himself and family (Sheesh)
By any means, your enemies, my enemies
We wet them up like a canteen (Damn)
The yellow tape surrounds the fate
Don't have a face, so now you late, open the gates (Damn)
Ultimate, infinite, flow is opium
Open the internet, photosynthesis
Put in parentheses, temporary
Very scary if I feel like Dirty Harry
Just might bust a bitch, never knew my life
But yet the question is, ""Is he fake? Is he real?""
What the message is, chop a bitch nigga up
I'ma sever it when I sever shit
I kill 'em, no Kony, these niggas ain't homies
Claim you the homie, I turn into Broly
Droppin' melodic, enter the cosmic
Flow like a prophet, lyrical toxic
Flow like a foreigner, I'm the torturer
Out of South Florida, call the coroner
Killed in the corridor, I'm the overlord
Rhymes like a sorcerer, I'm an animorph
Bitch, I'm a beast
Nigga, you tell me who fuckin' with me
K to the I to the N to the G
Claim you the hottest, but I disagree
Better learn something and get a degree
This for Lord Infamous, so R.I.P.​
Arrivederci, bitches lookin' thirsty

Why you wanna take my soul? I'm yelling out, ""Hell no!""
I can't even trust my friends, most of them might be foes

This is the wrath of Aquarius
I am the black metal terrorist, ain't no comparison
Humanitarian, bitch, I'm a veteran
Better than anyone comprehend
Snake in the grass, cut the copperhead
Hollow tips point at a copper head
Drop a head, poppin' the Glock 'til the copper dead
But Bishop killed Radames
That is the biggest hypocrisy
I don't see nobody stopping me
Bro, your whole life is a mockery
A militant, mind on a million
Civilian, I am the realest, bitch
No Gilligan, put me on an island
Smoking on an island 'til a nigga look Thailand
Spread through your crew like a motherfucking virus
Cloud 9 confederate, breaking up barriers
Federation in your area
If I'm a bitch, then I guess you a pussy, and pussies are scared of a terrier, woof
Run all your paper, killer Curry keep on catching the caper
Dominating, common denominator
Aftermath, you can just do the math later, as a teenager
I was an underdog under the Raiders, valuable player
Young Bo Jackson slammin' packs with a passion
Satisfaction with the lack of compassion
It's a maverick hella gaspin', but actually
I am that nigga entirely

And these halfway niggas and these halfway hoes
Wanna be buddy-buddy, they see you at a show
But be the main ones that be hating on the low
Wait, that's just irrelevant
They got the fact when you look at my melanin, woah
Cops killin' niggas, niggas killin' brothas, niggas hate each other, don't know
Where the fuck they came from, we the ones that paid dues
I don't watch Fox News, don't mean that all my foxes sly
Find a little white girl, but let you die
Gun like a veteran, breakin' off barriers, they just might call me a terrorist
Rather get caught with it than without it, if I keep it concealed when I carry it, I
Put them on paper
Send them to prison and give them free labor
Separate everyone, make sure they neighbors
Aftermath, after that, we can laugh later
Fuck all my haters
I raise a Black fist as black as the Raiders
Home of the Gators
Federation is my organization
All relation, no religion, no races
Black to Asian, we the nation of U.L.T.
True to you, so keep it true to me
Haters cannot put an end to me because I truly know who is my enemy, nigga

Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me
Let it float, let it float, let it float, let it float
Let it float, let it float by me

Inside this paper plane
Note my words are Navy sealed so here and I quote
Taboo and I are in the same boat
What's said from Pennywise, I guess we all float
Sky is the limit, I could die in a minute
Got my mind in a skillet, suicide not a mission
See the vibe very timid, I'm timid and very sad
Translated my thoughts and feelings, I pivot into the pad
Rapers turn to landscapers when they use hoes
Hoes turn to housewives when they see gold
Ice Cube with activator when I'm aggravated
Or decapitated when I lose my head since life is overrated
Two thousand feet, a thousand steps
I let it all sink to one thousand depths
Soon black balloons pop
Let it be the day the pain stop

Show my son to think so he can fly as high can be
Always show examples how they kill niggas like me
Thinking as straight as me, but call me crazy
Sun is my attitude, so I'm cool like JAY-Z
Ándale, ándale, my intelligence for threes

Cancel me like I ain't the number one G
Cancel me like you don't like ""Dance On Me""
Quickly they forget how you change on all these lies
You flashing all these lights, and you savin' these kids lives
And they hate you 'cause you're right, give me hell then, shit

Babe, when you hear the siren sounds
When the karma come back 'round, don’t let me down
Babe, there's a time to stand your ground
Even if one of them sounds, don't let me down

Eyesight is a gateway to a new day and the same hate
With a new height and the same feet on a airplane yelling, “Mayday”
With a good girl gone bad girl who went gay ’cause of date rape
That's a metaphor for the US 'cause they got us all in the same state
State of mind, brain is minimized, put me on the news, only criticize
Revolution will never be televised for the enemy, they never empathize
And I never voted, never sugar coat it with my finger itchin' and my gun loaded
When the fire open, let it be your moment
When I shoot the sheriff if he not demoted, then bang! (Bang, bang, bang)
This for Trayvon and Tree, burn the bush and chronic, speakin' honestly
We livin' in colonies, CNN sit-comedies
Monstrosity run rampant all throughout United States
Talkin' about “let's make a fort,"" talkin’ about “let’s make it great”
If the shoes fit, tie it, grab the guns and riot
Time to run with lions on the road to Zion
In this age of violence, time to grab the iron
When I pop the silencer, it's nothing but silence when–

But did I mention that my real intentions
Are on me really dealin' with the consequences
And I see your tone is very condescending
When I talk to you, but no you won't admit it
And I pity the fool
Been tryna vent, but you ain't tryna hear it
Like I'm not in here, but you gotta hear it
Just stop brushing me off to the side (Oh, shit)
Oh say, can you see a hundred dead bodies in the street
By the dawn's early light, double Sprite and a R.I.P. tee
So proudly, lights gleam, let the gun blaow in the night time

Come-come, here they come

When the karma come back 'round, don't let me down

Ronny J, listen up

I'm a gook!
If I told you that I wasn't then
A nigga wouldn't be telling you the truth
Back in high school, I admit I was a gook
But the way I rap had niggas fooled
Yeah, I'm a gook, niggas started skipping school, me and Monty and Raul
Hopping the fence by Carol City park
Fuck the next class, bitch, I'm already smart
Yet I'm a gook, see me growing out my hair cause I look like the nigga from Roots
Yeah I'm a gook, Denzel Curry been a gook
Nigga, that ain't nothing new
Yeah, I'm a gook, probably thinking that I'm fool if I told you that I'm rapping too
Yeah, I'm a gook, looking like that nigga Buu
Cut me off, I'm at the booth
Bitch, uh!

Jabbie told me we gon blow like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!

Loose, with a screw, loose from the Tre Deuce, smoking boof
Bitch, I always knew, that I was a gook
But how this gook ended up surpassing you
While you look at the views?
Made a hard album so what can you do?
I'm the Gook Runner, the Imperial
Shout out to Mook, that be my flesh
Niggas can't fathom that I am the best
I gave you Threatz, Ultimate next
Shoutout the Klan because that's on the set
Fucking with me, I will put you to rest
Lie and you'll remember to speak with your chest
Gooking forever I'm still at your neck
Bitch, I'm gooking forever so give me respect, bitch!

Jabbie told me we gon blow up like land mines
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
Jabbie told me we gon blow up like a land mine
I don't fuck with purp, that's the only reason Yams died
Nigga, I'm a gook, hella awky that's the truth
But I bet you I can even keep it 10 times better than you
I'm a gook!
From the days, I've seen thus far
People tell me that I gook on the daily
One day, I'm gon' be a star
I don't give a fuck if you're gonna hate me
New chains and brand new cars
People tell me that it's all gonna change me
But for now, my mind's on Mars
'Cause you know a nigga gook on the daily52Embed",https://images.genius.com/b1e87aef0e498102f23a03f8f301fae8.1000x1000x1.jpg

Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up
In this life, middle fingers up I don't fuck with a 95
I keep it true to me, why the fuck would I live a lie?
I'm living in this world, would you care if I live or die?
Are you down, then would you ride for me?
Because this life is so fucked up they telling lies to me
You are my main and as my main you'd better not lie to me
And I would tell you like Geminis there might be sides to me
She not my main bitch, I'ma tell you she's a side to me

Like, she assigned to me, but you are designed for me
And if I say I got your back then hold my spine for me
And if I couldn't shed a tear, girl, would you cry for me?
And if we was a couple doves, girl would you fly with me?
I'm overseas, what I oversee, ocean sea, see reflections of the way we supposed to be
Unluckily, we not at peace
That's the end of my clover leaf
Wouldn't care if you know it's me
Keep away until you notice me

Didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed
Not the same since my younger days, so far I came
Feel my pain till I can't complain, cause I'ma slide for a minute
Till I rise in the business, make a billion, show my niggas what up

Girl, are you out of your mind? I would think you were mine
You were a part of me, pardon me, parts of me died
Idolized you when I didn’t unite
You won't tell for the moment, but time will tell, but as of now

You didn't notice, but as of late, I think I changed

You giving me all of your stories in the littlest amount of time
You loving me is forbidden, loving you back is a crime
I wrote this poem for you, forever remain in my rhymes
I knew you wasn't normal ever since the age of nine
I, heard you were molested when you hit the age of five
So, in a sense I sensed that all your innocence had died
You, swallowing all of your pride, won't, let anybody inside
As you cry me a thousand lakes on my shoulder blade, I say
Everything's gonna be okay
I'ma hold tight 'til I see the next day with you
Stay with you, play with you, pray with you and pray to you
Curry killed the pussy hoping that I could kill the hate in you
Even if you don't wait for me, forever I will wait for you
Even if it's too late for me, forever I will wait for you
Watching your destiny fold in the grip of my palms

Me against the world, it's me, myself and I, like De La
Got in touch with my soul
Treadin' softly on the path down the rockiest road
Life isn't ice cream without Monopoly dough
The property grows in value, and rightfully so, I gotta have it
I see the way the people get treated, it's problematic
They ready to set us up for failure, it's systematic
But when I felt it, my eyes melted
The selfish are constantly profitin' off thе helpless
I'll nevеr do my team green, make the team green like the Celtics
The ones that ain't makin' it overzealous, they show and tell us
Throughout history, earnin' cheddar
They form and break out nickel-plated chrome Berettas
The same ol' story in a whole different era
I'm watchin' massacres turn to runnin' mascara, but anywho
For the pain, see what this Henny do
So we can see what lies beneath as we pour up a swig of truth
The sun sets as I sip a few
The sky turns a different hue farther from the color blue
The nighttime has arrived, I recline for the evenin'

This history right here
What's up, my nigga?
It's time to empower these niggas, man, do it for the city
We gotta give it to 'em raw, though, you heard me?

Hair is nappy, knotty
Fuck karate, I got me a shotty
Jumpin' in the door, kamikaze
Origami if the neighbors saw me
But I won't fold, oh no
That's how the young boy's ass got smoked
Buddy got jacked like MK4
Sub-Zero, put a nigga on, so
Iced out
This the price I gotta pay because I wanna be iced out
Have them lookin' at my face as they tellin' me lights out
Sleep is the cousin of death, knowin' NY not my state of mind
211's broad day, I had to live a life of crime

Get the product, then we out the door
Mama, I've been twistin' weed and now it's time to lock the fro
Blowin' dro
Call me knotty head 'cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the project, know this life ain't meant for us
Bitch, I can't be touched
Get the product, then we out the door
Mama, I've been twistin' weed and now it's time to lock the fro
Let it go
Call me knotty head and if I ever go
Tell my mama that I love her 'cause tomorrow not for sure
I would never know

This the way it is, I gotta get it how I live
Knotty-headed niggas

Hair is nappy, knotty, pack a pistol when I'm in the party
Life is melancholy, sellin' flock when they think it's molly
Bitches be givin' me sloppy, my pockets on Andy Milonakis
Bumpin' Speaker Knockerz, ""Rico Story"" when I see the coppers, damn
Golds in my mouth and my dreads lookin' like a palm tree
Plus you know what a nigga's skin tone is, so that's why they fuck with me
Opposition remain obsolete when aimin' and targetin'
Monday to Sunday all you niggas, we slangin' like Pistol Pete, peace

Get the product, then we out the door
Mama, I've been twistin' weed and now it's time to lock the fro
Blowin' dro
Call me knotty head 'cause I don't give a fuck
I was raised off in the project, know this life ain't meant for us

Uh huh, to be or not to be? (Huh)

If it ain't homicide, I don't commit
Y'all throw a fit when you don't got a fit
If you put out a hit
Bet you the killer ain't gon' make a cent
Bitch, it's a Miami nigga, no Moonlight
Let's take it back to the crib (Aah!)
One of my homies, he pull the gun on me
He turnin' cold on me like meet the maker
So super phony as if he don't know me
I see what they told me about the hater
And I wasn't even phased, in the hottest of the blaze
Talkin' 'bout a nigga changed with a pocket full of change
Brain disorder, blame this for the pain in Florida
Bipolar, vibe over, time slower I'm sober, now I sorta see (huh)
What is going on with me? (huh)
Gotta shout-out  G

Put her on the team 'cause we both makin' dollars

If she was a bop, I would hit, then I'll drop her
Hang with the bros 'cause you know blood thicker

Promise Heron I'll put my fist up, after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fuckin' flow that's-s so belittles, man
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas – nigga, listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it – in turn, these critics and interns
Admittin' the shit spitted, just burn like six furnaces
Writ, it affixed, learnin' them digits and simultaneously
Dispellin' one-trick-pony myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fuckin' six-nigga energy
And crawlin' down 'fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shoutin', thrashin', these niggas done let the kraken out
Crack-a-lackin' like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga

Whippin' hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
Brutus in that booth, double scoop, hock, vomit up
Subrocin' thud, knockin' niggas teeth-loose
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cop – rollin' with that flow swamp

Welcome to enemy turf, harder than immigrants work

Get up off the pavement, brush the dirt up off my psyche
Psyche, psyche

Can I get that, oh… let me get that beat in my headphones, louder

It's probably been 12 years since my father left
Left me fatherless
And I just used to say I hate him in dishonest jest
When honestly, I miss this nigga, like, when I was six
And every time I got the chance to say it, I would swallow it
Sixteen, I'm hollow, intolerant, skip shots
I storm that whole bottle, I'll show you a role model
I'm drunk, pissy, pissing on somebody front lawn
Trying to figure out how and when the fuck I missed moderate
Momma often was offering peace offerings
Think, wheeze, cough, scoffing and he's off again
Searching for a big brother, Tyler was that
And plus he liked how I rap, the blunted mice in the trap
Too black for the white kids, and too white for the blacks
From honor roll to cracking locks up off them bicycle racks
I'm indecisive, I'm scatterbrained, and I'm frightened

Craven and these Complex fuck niggas done track me down
Just to be the guys that did it, like, ""I like attention""
Not the type where niggas trying to get a raise at my expense
Supposed to be grateful, right?
Like, ""Thanks so much,"" you made my life harder
And the ties between my mom and I are strained and tightened
Even more than they were before all of this shit
Been back a week and I already feel like calling it quits

And this is painfully honest
And when I say it I vomit, on cloudy days when I'm salty
I play the hate to the logic
State to state for the profit, it ain't a stain on me, nigga
My momma raised me a prophet, I play for dollar incentive
And where I'm walking, it's studded, and half-retarded, I stumble
To where she park when she visit, I grab the bottle and chug it
I see the car in the distance, I know the dark isn't coming
For the moment, if I could hold it
You see, see, it seems that

All my dreams got dimmer when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
And loving you is a little different, I don't like you a lot
You see, it seems like, um
You might also like
I'm coming back, I gotta handle business
Vanish to my sleeper seat, left you at terminal three
I'll meet you down at baggage claim in a couple weeks, a fortnight
When you parade my homecoming, don't cry
You know I can't live in any place I visit
To live and die in LA
I got my Fleetwood Mac, I could get high every day
But I'd be sleepy, OCD and paranoid, so
Give me Bali beach, no molly, please, palm, no marijuana trees
Your hickeys on my aorta, and tattoos you could only see
When I'm playing surfboarder, put whiskey in that salt water
I emptied every canteen
Just to wear that straight-edge varsity you think's cool
They called me soft in high school, thank God I'm jagged
Forgot you don't like it rough, I mean, he called me a faggot
I was just calling his bluff
I mean, how anal am I gon' be when I'm aiming my gun?
And why's his mug all bloody? That was a three-on-one
Standing ovation at Staples, I got my Grammys and gold
Polka dots on my Brit, I'm not supposed to be stunting
It's all melodic, this song
I catch this vibe in my sleep, but I'm just jet-lagged is all
And restless

All my dreams got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Nightmares got more vivid when I stopped smoking pot
Loving you's a little different I don't like you a lot
I mean… fuck
I don't know what we're about
What good is West Coast weather if you're bi-polar?
If I'ma need this sweater, I'd rather be where it's cold
Where it snows, I see how it goes
I put the flowers in bowls, I know they're coming in droves
You'll only miss when it goes

Yo, I'm a hot and bothered astronaut
Crashing while jacking off
To buffering vids of Asher Roth eating apple sauce
Sent to Earth to poke Catholics in the ass with saws
And knock blunt ashes into their caskets, and laugh it off
Twisted, sicker than mad cattle, in fact I'm off
Six different liquors, with a Prince wig plastered on
Stop screaming, bitch, you shouldn't be that alarmed
When Big Lips is in the attic, armed with an addict's arm
Earl puts the ""ass"" in ""assassin""
Puts the pieces of decomposing bodies in plastic
Puts them in a pan and mixes it up with scat
Then gobbles it like fat black bitches and catfish
It so happens that I'm so haphazardous
I'll puke a piece and put it on a hook and fucking cast the shit
I'm askin' that you faggot rap actors take action
And get a hall pass for this class-act shit
How the fuck I fit an axe in a satchel?
Slip capsules in a glass, she dizzy rascal
Party staff baffled, asking where her ass go
In my room, redefining the meaning of black holes
Go on, suck it up; but hurry, I got nuts to bust
And butts to fuck and ups to shut and sluts to fuckin' uppercut
It's O.F., buttercup, go ahead, fuck with us
Without a doubt, a sure-fire way to get your mother fucked
Ask her for a couple bucks, shove a trumpet up her butt
Play a song, invade her thong
My dick is having guts for lunch, as well as supper
Then I'll rummage through her ruptured cunt
Found the mustard
Fucking nosey neighbors notice something's up
""What you doing?"" – nothing much
Would shout some other stuff
Got to fucking bounce, guess the bouncer's had enough of us

No, fuck that, nigga, I got you

Grab mittens, who have to spit blizzardous
Actually, flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then
Dash to Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Racquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and filetted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Ha, vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, mama and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, uh, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezel stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea-kettle songs
(Bitch-ass niggas!)

Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon

Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch

Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose with spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms

Alright
Ugh, ugh, ugh

Good grief, I been reaping what I sowed
Nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
I been living what I wrote
And all I see is snakes in the eyes of these niggas
Mama taught me how to read 'em when I look
Miss me at the precinct getting booked
Fishy niggas stick to eating off of hooks
Say you eating, but we see you getting cooked, nigga
I don't act hard, I'm a hard act to follow, nigga
Like it or not, when it drop, bet he gotta listen
Chasing dragons, tryna make it happen, on a mission
If you step into the shadows, we could talk addiction
When it's harmful where you going and the part of you that know it don't give a fuck
Pardon me for going into details
3-7-6 was a brothel, we had females coming every hour on the dot
And the shit sound like a gavel when it knock
Focused on my chatter, ain't as frantic as my thoughts
Lately, I've been panicking a lot
Feeling like I'm stranded in a mob
Scrambling for Xanax out the canister to pop
Never getting out of hand, steady handling my job
Time damaging my ties
Who turn to get up? Get dude turned to dinner quick
You circus niggas, you turning into tricks
I was making waves, you was surfing in 'em
Dealing with the stomach pains just from birthing niggas' shit
Cut the grass off the surface
Pray the lawnmower blade catch the back of a serpent nigga, shit

Snakes sliding in the street

Pigs riding in 'em
I'm a target, so it's hard to even eye me in 'em
If he ain't dying for me, then I ain't riding with him
There's no time for that
Making sure my man wallet's straight
Like a collar when you iron that
Thinking 'bout my grandmama
Find a bottle, I'ma wallow and I lie in that
Um, I just want my time and my mind intact
When they both gone, you can't buy 'em back

My grandma's passing
But I'm too busy tryna get this fuckin' album crackin' to see her
So I apologize in advance if anything should happen (Cut that bitch off!)
And my priorities fucked up, I know it, I'm afraid I'm gonna blow it
And when them expectations raising because daddy was a poet, right?
Talk all you want, I'm takin' no advice, nigga
I'm 'bout to relish in this anguish, and I'm stressin' over payment (Cut that bitch off!)
So don't tell me that I made it, only relatively famous
In the midst of a tornado, misfitted, I'm Clark Gable
I'm not stable, (I'm not stable) abrasive as fuck and they all (Cut that bitch off!)
Pay me, I'm chuckling cross-faded in public
Heart racin' 'til blunt is lit, (Like he don't give a fuck again, right?)

""Hey Thebe, nigga, what's up nigga? I heard you back, I need them raps, nigga. I need the verse, I don't care about what you going through or what you gotta do nigga, I need bars, sixteen of 'em.""

I don't fuck with too much of y'all's shit
Judgin' by the pants and the mall grip
Gully, in the vans with the dark tints
I'm a start-shit type nigga (Cut that bitch off!)

Ridin' in the Jeep, I'mma side-swipe niggas
What's your life like? That's alright nigga
Hammer in the left ready when the price isn't
Right got the whip and I ain't got the license for it
And Jill got me living like my life is golden
Sitting on the sofa feeling high and dormant
If we could smoke another while the mic records it (Cut that bitch off!)
The nicest doin' it, who the fuck you staring at?
Acting like you've never seen a tooth that's carat-capped
Bars hotter than the blocks where we be at
Stuntin' these niggas gon' flop like Divac

Late for everything, my face to the cement
That's how I always seen it
I spent days faded and anemic
You could see it in my face, I ain't been eatin'
I'm just wastin' away
Looks like the way that River Phoenix went gon' end up my fate
And when they drag me out the gutter, mail the ashes to my mother
Twist the spliff if I don't finish my plate
Slip a fist up for my niggas in chains, my mental was caged
See, I ain't been to prison but the feeling's the same
Shared sentiment, when and if the pen hit the page
As of late, I've been watchin' every bitch in my space
Shit's just lookin' different with age
Try to make some sense of all this shit in my brain

It's me and my nibbling conscience

I've been alone for the longest
It's trouble, the way that we joggin'
Nothin' gon' save us or stop us
Me and my nibbling conscience
Nigga, I'm fixin' to give up
I've been alone for the longest
This spliff, I ain't splittin' no time soon
My brain split in two, it's rainin' a bit
I hope it's a monsoon, my face in the sink
I'm seein' my mom soon, I'm faded, I stink
Stay in it, alright..? (Faded, I'm stayin' in...)


I got my grandmama's hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated
And not by nothin' by myself, my second thoughts, my sec

My hands, I start to cry when I see 'em
'Cause they remind me of seein' her
These the times that I needed her most 'cause I feel defeated
And not by nothin' but myself, my second thoughts
My hectic process of thinkin' and all my doubts, and I think
I know Nak in there sleepin', he on the couch, that's my brother
Give me a boost when my confidence need it, so I love him
To tell the truth, I got a problem with eatin', I be druggin'
To tell the truth, I'm not supposed to be off in here
I'm supposed to be sleepin', but I be turnin' and tossin'
To tell the truth, I miss my partna dem
To tell the truth, you can't be loud when you're the wrongest, fam

Shrunk and widened with the bumps in my personal finance
It hurt 'cause I can’t keep a date or put personal time in
Or reverse to the times when my face didn’t surprise you
Before I did the shit that earned me my term on that island
Can’t put a smile on your face through your purse or your pocket

""Oh... me? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm just tryna say somethin' before... I... I... drop it off.""

I feel like the Tom Sawyer for real niggas
Looking for a problem, revolver under the Hilfiger
No bluff needed, we will kill niggas
So try me if you want, bruh, I promise I'm with all of that
Late night shooters, got 'em thinking Johnny Carson back
Trying to win this white man's game with my heart intact
All off a dollar and a dream that I really had
Kind of hard to sleep when your thoughts is in the streets
Norf Norf is the side where my family stay
Big Baby Jesus, I can't wait
Until the money coming in, spend it all on guns and rims
I ain't nothing but a nigga, ain't no reason to pretend

Kept the sticky in a Stussy pouch
Ski mask, bloody 'Preme hoodie tossing doobies out
The window of the hoopty, night black as Paul
Mooney at the movies but the moon was out
Food was always optional
Eating nothing but hard punches to that abdominal
Closed fist chronicles, sold sniff, Momma knew
Baggies laying 'round, peanut shells at a carnival
Stomping clowns, welcome pussy niggas to the romper room
Buckshot'll cover a whole torso like a parka do
In a park at two, plotting, trying to garner loot
Split it with his big road dog, call him Marmaduke
Searching for a shard of truth and found, uh
Couple bucks bought his cousins lunch
Another Dutch, stiff collar on the button-up
Hood, rich, wild, and 'bout to run amok
Road to Hell paved with cement
Covered trussled drugs, toughen up

Better run right home when the sky turn black

Act like you don't know the name
Only time I ain't eating when the chocha stanky
Listening to ""Pre,"" getting throat while I lane-switch
Bitches by the three licking coke off the pinky

And if they hated in a passive tense
Now, they hound your dick, and you ain't ask for this
Now you surrounded with a gaggle of a hundred fucking thousand kids
Who you can't get mad at when they want a pound and pic
'Cause they the reason that the traffic on the browser quick
And they the reason that the paper in your trouser's thick

Then another six days, back to Sunday when it's done again (Shit)

Look, I got hoes in my britches
Big-up Dill and Britches, full part coming soon

Just checking and balancing
Checks and the salaries testing my friendships

So long to every bitch tryna get intimate

Feet aimed at the jaws of the running mouth
Disdain for the law since a fucking child

Ma said, ""Wake up son, good morning""
I rolled out of bed, greeted mama with a yawn, then
Paused to scratch and itch, and went down to the kitchen
Fixed a plate of eggs and bacon, glass of OJ Simpson
Just as I was about to dig in
A thought jumped in my head, school was to be attended, shit
I paid my thoughts no attention
'Cause I wasn't tryna kick it with this bitch that just ended it with me
But Mama wasn't havin' it
So I grabbed my bag and split out the door and saw the whore that I'd rather kick
It seems kinda brash but it's the hash, I mean, the harsh truth
She runs shit, she's the jock, I'm the horseshoe
She's gorgeous, when niggas see it, jaws hit the floor, so
When she left, it didn't break my heart it broke my torso
Making my eyes ache, stalking your MySpace
Posted a new pic, I mean it when I say that I fucking hate you
But
Maybe if you looked in this direction
I'd pick my heart up off the floor and put it in my chest then
Feel the fucking life rushin' through my body
But you got a guy that's not me, so my wrist is looking sloppy
Come on, let's cut the bull like a matador

Another one cops three (Yeah) then Bodie hands you off 10 more
But some white guy rolls up in a car

Waves you down and pays for the eight
How many vials you got left? (15)

Count be wrong, they’ll fuck you up

Quarter brick, half a brick, whole brick, ayy nigga
Time to whip these zippers in the kitchen with the same nigga
All I know is selling weed and water, dope and yay nigga
Money on my mind, don't do the crime unless it pay nigga
New 650 Bimmer coupe, I'm fucking in a foreign car
Got diamonds in my Rollie face, I'm bout to cop a Audemar
Top down on a bitch when I ride by, I feel like fuck the law
Got diamonds in my Rollie face, I'm bout to cop an Audemar

We kick them hoes out, ain't no room service, we ain't bringing no breakfast in
Got an oval office in my house, bitch suck me off like a president

So much pussy, look like I'm sellin' it
And the polices know that I'm sellin' it
I did the one and the two with the heroin
And my nigga was snitchin', he tellin' it
I had to jump off a war with the Mexicans
Gotta get me a brand new plug
I run out of dope and I'm out of my element
Yeah, uh, bitch, Google my government, but that's not my name

Ho, I play for the rings
Every ho that I got is a side bitch
I ain't never gon' fuck on the main
Better Alex Trebek, I don't answer those questions
Jeopardize how far we done came
We are not one in the same, we can rock the same thing

Still too cool to love these hoes
All I wanna do is fuck these hoes
Still too cool to love these hoes
All I wanna do is fuck these hoes
(I love you, Freddie)

Once upon a time 'round '99 (Yeah)
I took a chick to the prom with a big behind (Aye)
She had a cute face, a thin waist, a bright smile (Yeah)
Titties mediocre, but ass was like, blaow
Might have been two thou' when I met that hoe
But on the low I used to sweat that hoe, I had to let that go
'Cause baby had me with a hell of a crush (Yeah)
Love letters on her locker, I ain't give no fuck
What other niggas thought about me (Still don't)
'Cause I was all about we, me and her 'til I D-I-E (Yeah)
Made me want to do some shit like carve her name in a tree
Like we was K-I-S-S-I-N-G
But little did I know she had a dude
With hella money, hella jewels, I was just another nigga in school (Yeah)
A straight fool, for thinking I was special or different (Yeah)
Lost my respect for the rest of the bitches (Ha)
I played hoes and shank hoes for bankrolls (Rolls)
Never thought they'd fill my heart with pain though
I would laugh when a broad made my niggas feel blue (Yeah)
But the jokes ain't funny when the joke's on you (Haha)
Let me stroke something boo, let me get that pearl (Yeah)
Touch your softest spot, let me in your world (Come on)
And you can be his girl, and that nigga can remain your man (Uh huh)

I had a bad bitch from Nap named Nicole
Nicole used to keep a nigga dick on swole (Yeah)
She knew I had a girlfriend, but she love my pole
And when she saw me with my woman, then she lost control
And went crazy, ""Freddie I can't believe you played me (Man)
People told me that niggas from the G was shady (Yeah)
You forgot you didn't wear a rubber when you laid me
I'm pregnant and it's your baby"" (Shit)
Hell of a bind, these hoes put me through a hell of a time (Real)
Met a girl last year that I thought was mine (Yeah)
Came all the way to NY to see me rhyme
Flew her ass out to LA for Christmas time
And shit was fine, we on the same beat
And she ain't got a problem with me being in the street
I know I ain't her one and only, but I'm hoping I ain't one of many
Baby pretty, but she tryna play me silly, 'cause she really
Wasn't thinkin' 'bout religion when she tell me the dick bomb
But then she up and left me 'cause I practice Islam
I guess Mom told her that the boy ain't right (Yeah)
And she gon' pray to Jesus Christ to take me out of her life
And out of her sight, she keep it undercover (Yeah)
I really used to mean it when I told her that I love her (For real)

I done did a lot of bad things just to get change
I done took it to some levels that a lot of niggas won't go
Take a life just to get a name
Came up with the crackheads, thugs and the cut-throats
Bloodshot from the blunt smoke
Man I'm so high that I can't even look my own momma in the eyes
Kicked out through the front door
She said the way a nigga livin', if I die, she won't be surprised
Tears on the Bible, she prayed for me
This can't be the life that she made for me
Got her lying to police when they raid for me
If there's a Heaven, will they open up the gates for me?
I wanted money for the summer, make a nigga trunk knock
Gang signs out the window, screamin' out, ""Fuck cops""
Soft dope, hard dope, get it all one stop
Slung crack rock, never had a wicked jump shot, yeah
Middle school, it was no joke
Hats broke to the right in the hall, it was all Folks
Little Lord had to lay low
Had a .38, I kept it in my locker, you ain't even know
I wasn't from their hood so the Westside niggas
They ain't really have no reason to respect a nigga
And since I went to school with them motherfuckers
Niggas from my hood actin' like they ain't accept a nigga
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out
Broad day with the strap out
Can't forget it, don't regret it, gave a nigga somethin' to rap about
All that I could do was lash out
Get a couple down niggas, put the mask on, cash out

Fuck rap, dope game put a nigga on
Dope game, rap game got a nigga stressed
Heavy smokin', heavy drinkin', runnin' through a check
Got me trippin', diamonds drippin' off a nigga neck
Runnin' through a hundred bitches, who I'm doin next?
And my girl at the crib got her own
She don't need a dog nigga like that
It be a hole in my motherfuckin' soul
If see another nigga wife that
Don't like that but it's like that
Steady tryin to keep my cool in a game full of fake niggas
Backstabbin' and snake niggas
Do a song with you, talk about you, smile in your face niggas
Shouts out to the nigga Snow
We was tryna take the world just like Tony and Manolo
But he shot me at the front door
He ain't want to see another nigga happy, that's a no-no

Yeah, yeah
Diego, roll me one up, my nigga
Yeah, yeah, Kane, yeah

The future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
I admit that I was timid at a younger age, nigga
Daddy asked me what I wanna be, I said, ""A paid nigga""
Whippin' extras out the pot, I gave myself a raise, nigga
Heaven sent, I can't remember the last time I prayed, nigga
So the Devil introduced me to cookin' cocaine, nigga
On the blade, seven days, ain't bathe or shave, nigga
I was, thuggin' with my trey-eight
Motherfuck a president, I got a Presidential Day-date
I run a check up like a Chase bank
The police open up the package if your shipment come a day late
I just beat a rape case—groupie-bitch I never fucked
Tried to give me ten for some pussy that I never touched
At a certain level, system tried to test a nigga's nuts
Nigga hire like eleven lawyers—had to level up, yeah

Living this life, just me, myself and I
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)
If I gotta be by myself, I'ma be alright
(Level up, you know a nigga had to level up)

Got me in this foreign prison, monkey in a cage, nigga
Bail paid, locked me up for an extra 30 days, nigga
Barely let us use the shower, ain't bathed or shaved, nigga
I was, sittin' in a cell missin' show dates
Commissary late, I'm postin' pictures with the toothpaste
Barely eat the food, stress'll make a nigga lose weight
Enter the mental of a nigga that wish he knew his fate
Shit these bitches do to try to get your cash
Erica visit, can't wipe her tears from behind the glass
Choppin' the porcelain up for years, said I'm suckin' glass
I beat the DEA and the task, now I'm on my ass
Future started yesterday, nigga
Every minute feelin' different, I am not the same nigga
Donald Trump gon' chain us up and turn back to slaves, nigga
Got the recipe for dope, my reparations paid, nigga
Feel like that at some point, really I should feel ashamed, nigga
They kill us, we killin' us, but that is not the way, nigga
Money tree up in the stripper club, I'm throwin' shade, nigga
Did destruction on your flow when I paved the lane, nigga
Chest to chopper, blow your chest out, where your heart at, nigga?
Black Tony, Babyface, better scar that nigga
Sent the hit out, I'm just waitin' on the call back, nigga
Shoot them pussies, burn it up, don't bring the car back, nigga
Gangsta G, I fucked the industry, them crackers say I'm too aggressive
I turned myself into a boss without a fuckin' question

Slammin', used to sleep on the floor with a Kel-Tec
Got a bag I can't bag yet because it's still wet
Repo man, I pay him a visit, ain't paid his bills yet
Brain hemorrhage, blunt-force trauma, I make him feel that
I wrap and seal that
Sent out the bricks that had the Nike Swoosh stamps, I'm just doin' it for the camp
Nigga showed 'em to the plug, now he shoppin' behind my back, uh
One thing about that bitch karma, she comin' back
If you trappin', keep a strap close
Nowadays, this shit became a trend to snake your homies out 'cause everybody backdoor
But everybody Black, though
I let the fiends catch a bean, usеd to vomit off the secondhand crack smoke
Nigga got that PTSD from tеstin' the key
Gums numb, hope I didn't purchase work from the F-E-Ds
'Cause every time I see the judge, it's like a scary movie
Fuck the court, real nigga can't do no jury duty
Internet done altered this shit through a different game now
I don't rap about dead opps, I let his name die
Shame how they blackball Kane, they scratched my name out
I pushed it longer than I expected to get my name hot

They wanna take me out this game like Sha'Carri
Black Illuminati, touch Big Rabbit, streets need a body
I got all of them leeches away from 'round me
You ain't rich enough to get me hit, pussy, go up the bounty, uh

Turn the witness to Stevie Wonder, ho, you ain't seen shit

Now I push the goons through the boondocks in the Countach
Penthouse in the city, my bops givin' me rooftop
Told 'em free my nigga G-Weeder, ho, let the Whoops out
You feel my energy, they gon' remember me
Ain't never had a friend like me, your enemy my enemy
Lambo crashed the whip and got plates in both shoulders
If he didn't live through that accident, this shit could've been over, yeah

They wanna take me out this game like Sha'Carri
Black Illuminati, afghan doggy straight off the poppy
I ain't trust him, had to dust him like Christopher Moltisanti
And it hurt my heart to hurt you, but nigga, streets need a body, yeah
I don't house these hoes, bitch, get a hobby
She ain't workin', then you ain't got a wifey, you got a Tommie, yeah
I got all of them leeches away from 'round me
Bulletproof the Escalade, I got iron like Robert Downey, nigga, yeah

Fuck you lil' niggas (Uh)
(Triple-S exercise)
Kane
Kiss, haha
It's what we do, nigga
I don't do the Chrome Heart, I just do the home art
You can catch a headshot or you can catch a dome dart
Go ahead and put the kids to sleep, this the grown part
'Fore we knew what Billboard was, we had our own chart
Strapped and they pull the car over, you take your own charge (Take that)
I ain't never worked for nobody, I sold my own hard (That's right)
Smoke a fat one in the back right in my own yard
Playin' dominoes with my man, he in the boneyard
Now I can pay for the jet right on my own card
Niggas tryna go man on me, I'm in the zone, God
Hand-to-hand with it, I ain't never played the phone, God
Calisthenics and cardio, just tryna tone, God (That's it)
Your man got the semi, but he ain't poppin'
My youngin got the bricks in the hemi, and he ain't stoppin'
Lil' extra in the beginning to get him coppin' (Uh-huh)
He ain't worried, 'cause if they get him, I get him Cochran (I got him)
He know not to fuck with them bitches, they get him hot then (He know)
Stay low, finish the work, he get a drop Benz (Yeah)
They just wanna be around money, but they are not friends (Nah)
Until you fall back from 'em, that's where the plot ends (Yeah)

They gotta ram it, you don't ever let the cops in (Never)

Kane, nigga, on the blade
I think, I think niggas forgot who, you know, who gave
Who gave these niggas this flow, you know what I'm sayin'?
Baby Scarface

I first tasted cocaine in 10th grade
Homie at the table choppin' Rick James
Sent the package off from Texas, it's been six days
Keep it sweatin' like a pig until that bitch came
Nigga had to keep a job, livin' off in my momma's spot
Fuck it, I'ma bust a fuckin' jugg, I'm a juggernaut
Pop a zone and drop it off in that water, we was cookin' out
Loud packs and molly powder all these niggas pushin' out
Feds lookin', cause I peddled paint to these poor folks
The realest niggas that I know ain't never sold dope
The hardest niggas that I know ain't never served time
Soon as I got me thirty thousand, I hit the bird line
And I brought that dog back to the set, niggas know me for that
Shout out to my niggas from D.C. with them scorpion packs
Keep this strictly business, you can't mix up your homie with that
One day you might have to clap a nigga, no glory in that
Feel like I'm outgrowin' all my friends, niggas thinkin' small
Gon' have to write them all a check, just to get the shit resolved
Then turn right back around and write them another one when they trick it off
Get successful and watch how quickly niggas get in their feelings, dawg
Get successful and watch how you immediately become their competition
Niggas worse than a side bitch, they can't quite stay in a position
Don't know what niggas crave more, money or a-fuckin-ttention

Felt so pimpish when Alexys put me in the foreign whip

Takin' my black queens for granted, got me ignorin' them

Names I be callin' her, nigga know you be doggin' her
What kind of man is you to you little niece and yo' daughter and 'em?
I’m posted at the stove with that yola, that soda lockin' in
Ving Rhames guns and butter, niggas get margarine
Pussy niggas can't play they part, we dearly departed them
Quick like OJ Simpson, you Bart, Homer, and Marge and 'em
I rap but I keep weight, and I know the streets take
Niggas out the game, my baby momma told me be safe
Turned around and said, ""Fuck safe, I stay dangerous""

Rob me a nigga
Rob me a, rob me a nigga
Cause the bills too high, this nigga right here too fly
And right now I might just rob me a nigga

The liquor got me lurking and looking for a lame nigga
To set up for my next lick
In the Chevy, about to roll up the stress, with a Tec
And what he got on his neck, got him a death wish
It's kinda funny cause he used to be my nigga tho
We was breaking bread, flipping bricks like a year ago
Shit can get into a nigga's head when his digits low
Make you wanna send one of your friends to his funeral
Maybe me and him was never friends in the first place
Don't mean a thing cause we share the same birthplace
Same city, same hood, but we down to kill each other for a dollar
Cause we want it in the worst way
Money talk and bullshit gon walk a marathon
And I ain't scared of getting killed cause I'm getting mine
And if they ever try to raid, I'mma hit the fuckin pigs with the K's
I ain't tryna do a lick of time
Spend all my last money, the bills too high
His jewelry, his whip game, the wheels too fly
I'm thinking about murder every time we cruise by
Heard he got like 84 elbows of blue fire
In the basement, muthafuckas still think basic
Thinkin' I won't show up and erase 'em, but I ain't gonna chase 'em
I'mma be up in his crib waiting
""Bitch where the cash? I can taste it""
Put em on their faces: what you know about kidnapping
And holding a nigga's whole family for ransom?
When your stomach empty it's easy to understand it
Got me out here taking them penitentiary chances
""Born in this world of tears, will die laughing""
Put that on the headpiece right above my casket
Still in the game, my batteries still lastin
Bout to put some gas up in my Caprice Classic, and...

Bet this hundred round drum pussy nigga thinkin twice
Fore he try to run, shots spit, and the cops come
All they seen was my golds and a black mask
Throw the car round the corner, tinted up with no tags
All these niggas wanna flash, Ima put it to they ass
With the K out, ask a nigga, “Where da sack at?""
Give it here, you wanna die for that rolex?
You can either get your life or that watch back
Ima shoot you point blank, I’m just hoping you think
You can take it as a loss, you can get it back
Nigga, buck and get shot, that’s the street code
I’m leave you there, do you, that’s how the shit go
Just another episode, A-K explode
In his head, left a smoke hole
Be a shamed if you died over fake shit
But that’s a lesson, if you out here on some fake shit
Come and robbin everyday, know the young nigga hungry
They be murkin for a quarter brick
Know they kill a whole fam for the whole thang

All the little homies strapped, so they look plain
Gun shots rang out, nigga, see flames

We be lookin for your shit fore your shit come

Snow said: ""Let's hit the awards,"" but we ain't dressin' up
Showed up in a tank top and chucks, he in a fuckin' tux
Textin' Ross to get some advice, he keep me buttoned up
I disrespected bro several years ago, I was fuckin' up (Yeah)
Now I love him like my momma son
House up in the hills ain't shit 'til you get your momma one
You a certified crack baby, I ganked your momma funds
Pray the Lord forgive me for selling dope during Ramadan, uh
Duha keep a nigga stable
Them crackers mark a nigga grave before you touch the cradle
I sent a ton off to the Moes 'cause I was more than able (Feen)
They let the GDs in the door, the Lords was at the table (Feen)

Uh, yeah
Rest in peace Big Time, nigga
You know what I'm sayin', nigga? (Broadway)
That private school shit is expensive (Triple S)
Ayo, roaches on my cereal boxes, in Gary living poor
Same meal Saturday morning, we watchin' Diff'rent Strokes
Diego shakin' up with me, Ced and them niggas flippin folks
I was sellin' dope when Kanye was workin' at River Oaks (Yeah, yeah)
I did it with no radio
Had a million dollars before I ever met Ebro (Yeah)
'Cause up until this point my activities was illegal (Yeah)
I never made a chart, I ain't let it fuck with my ego (Fuck a ego)
What I drop spark fear
I had the album of the year, bitch, you can ask Nasir
The gangsta rapper of the year runnin' like ten years straight
Sometimes I feel like all my flowers comin' ten years late (That's how I feel, bitch)
But fuck it (That's how I feel, nigga)

Had to be twice as nice as these niggas for y'all to notice me
King Rabbit, nobody over me
If I had a time machine
The younger Fred would be buying bricks from the older me
If I had a time machine I would bring Chad Butler back

Lifestyles of the insane
Eastside thug nigga, I'm the shit, you a shit stain
I let the boxframe switch lanes
Not a pretty nigga, but I got some game for a bitch brain
And I lay it on so thick
Charge it all to a broad, heard a pimp nigga quote this
And I'm allergic to a broke bitch
I think I need my medicine, I had to po' up 'fore I wrote this
And doing dirty keep a nigga with a deep pocket
Dope fiends and the cluckheads keep shopping
Steady praying that the yayo keep locking
Keep a strap cause the jackboys keep robbing
Got me pulling up slow
Whip another clip and put my pedal to the floor
Slamming Cadillac doors, working wood like a pro
Ass sit on nothing but that leather, whatcha know, how you living, nigga?
Lifestyles of the insane
Roll the kill, pop a pill, crack a seal, I resist pain
Niggas looking for that big stain
Dirt weed, dog food, fye kush, niggas flip 'caine
Think I lost my religion
Stepping on a pack, break 'em off in the kitchen
Chevy topped off with the chrome in the engine
Niggas gotta floss, that's the cost of this pimping, I'ma pull up slow

Motherfucking white chalker, might've caught ya
In the streets with your pants down
Tell 'em call the paramedics, nigga man down, ease up
If you thugging, get your Gs up
And never fake, never fraud, never fold, never freeze up
A black mask, black tee'd up
The motherfucking dope game feed us, how you living, nigga?
And rest in peace to my motherfucking homeboy
But hold your tears, he ain't die, he just a fuckboy
You might as well be a dead man in my eyes

A pack of backwoods, dirty styrofoam, and a pocket full of stones
And my Cadillac Brougham, I'ma pull up slow

Yeah, rock solid nigga
Solid as a motherfuckin' rock, bitch
Yeah, nigga

When you fall, who you gon' land on?
Niggas foundation is shaky, ain't shit to stand on
A man's born with the only guarantee to live and die
But will I die before I live, 'fore I begin to fly?
Nigga, I can't deny when I'm not high, I miss that rush, that shit be callin' me
Demons never rest, I go to sleep, them bitches follow me
I just bought a AR for my dog, he walked the dog for me
Breakfast and promethazine with Ocean Spray and broccoli
Chase these hoes and I act like I can't keep these bitches off of me
They only fuckin' a nigga that got the most dollars in your squadary
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
That Bentley, Benz or Beamer, shippin' B's, I don't be in it
Not to let these bitches see me in it, fuck a ceilin'
Nigga wanna be me, even Steve could see the G in him
She work in the mornin', get that pussy in the PM then
I get in it then I jetted, it was a fly by, red bottoms, the thigh high
And every time she see me, she's sayin' ""I don't know why I
Fuck with niggas like you 'cause at first, you would play the shy guy""
Give me that pussy once and I always got it like the Wi-Fi, bitch
I went to visit my nigga, he caught him a charge, his cards was fraudulent
Time to go get me some yayo, I know that Andrea gon' lease that car for me
I remember when Dukie lost his arm in fuckin' armed robbery
When I seen his shit was danglin', almost felt my heart stoppin' G
Stop it G, drop it G, so much weed, forgot to breathe
Some niggas take the trip I took, but they don't get to leave
Came out that bitch, I'm speakin' Russian, German, Guapanese
Can't let these niggas stunt my growth from livin' for my seed

Yeah, for sure nigga
We came from nothing nigga, from shit nigga
For real

Dolo and the pour up
Got me tore up from the floor up
Gang signs, gang handshakes every time a nigga show up
All the real niggas know us
Back in '09, me and Lam, we was looking for a way out
But ain't nobody want to show us
Riding 'round, selling blow, shotgun doors out his Volvo
Must have sowed a whole O up
And you stuck it out with me, I love you like a brother
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have no rap career or nothing
I know you hate the fact that I'm so loyal to my street affiliation
But my niggas need a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
Willie and Diego need a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
My nigga Butter hit me for a pack, I'm out here thuggin'
And now the DEA, they checkin' on me when I'm gettin on a plane
Double life, it got me ducking undercovers
I just want to be legit man, shit man
And every time I touch the dope, I say that this gon' be my last flip man
I got a shorty that's willing to sell it for me
She my lover, my homie, the devil cursed me with a pimp hand
I hope my daughter never lives this type of lifestyle
Creeping under streetlights as a night child
My uncle still can't put the liquor or the pipe down
Meanwhile I'm in this kitchen whipping up the white gal
Plus I got addictions of my own, boy
The pills into laced blunts got me gone, boy
The Oxycontin and heavy syrup got me looking in the mirror
Saying, ""Is you a dope fiend or a dope boy?""
Smoking on some shit that I can't pass to a nigga
Eyes shiny than a bitch, glass to a nigga
Down to kick in the door, .44 mags to a nigga
Got some habits I pray that I never pass to a nigga
All about the dollar signs, fuck the sympathy
And fuck police cause they killing you and killing me
Slanging and banging, my paper stay getting fatter
So do black lives matter when you 'bout to kill your enemy?
I need to know it, drop that paper boy don't be heroic
You'll get a trip to see your Jesus if you're reaching for it

The only one who make it last forever is Keith Sweat
You ever see a body lyin' dead in the streets yet
Then eat breakfast? Swallow forced beliefs like police justice
If my city is like yours
Then serials scratched, fingerprints is wiped off
If people seem to always have somethin' to fight for
But still end up in the state pen or the psych ward, it's lights off
They catch so many casualties, it's like war
That's the reason I don't believe in the hype y'all

Yo, my memoirs are like the Anarchist's Cookbook
Meets the Tom Ford spring/summer look book
Some people wanna see me hanging from a good hook
Instead I hang with a language and slang in
The anguish and pain fit as well cause it came with us
After all these years carrying this shame with us
Now the entire planet is going insane with us
Seven year old kids carrying flame spitters
Fortified fences, mortify senses
Crossfire missed my little daughter by inches
Chemical dependence, medical expenses
But no amount of money on earth can buy vengeance
Writing a life sentence, sirens, fire engines
Tyrants seen through the eyes of the wide lenses
Senseless crimes cause some of us want to drive Benzes
But are you tryna ride with us or against us?
As long as they kill us
And go to Wendy’s and have a burger and go to sleep
They gon' keep killing us
But when we die and they die
Then soon we gon' sit at a table, and talk about it, we tired
We want some of this earth
Or we'll tear this goddamn country apart!

Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy
I blew cool from AC, ayy, Obama just paged me, ayy
I don't fabricate it, ayy, most of y'all be fakin', ayy
I stay modest 'bout it, ayy, she elaborate it, ayy
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ayy
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ayy
If I kill a nigga, it won't be the alcohol, ayy
I'm the realest nigga after all

If Pirus and Crips all got along
They'd probably gun me down by the end of this song
Seem like the whole city go against me
Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!
Man down, where you from, nigga?
Fuck who you know—where you from, my nigga?
Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga?
This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga
Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself
Uh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where **** hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up?
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk?
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from AK's, AR's, ""Ayy, y'all—duck""
That's what mama said when we was eatin' that free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct
Make sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess

Every time I'm in the street, I hear—
Yawk! Yawk! Yawk!—

Wake yo' punk-ass up
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin', nigga)
Hood ('Sup, cuz?)
It ain't nothin' but a Compton thang
G-yeah, how we do

Fresh outta school 'cause I was a high school grad'
Sleepin' in the living room of my mama's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed (Watch out, cuz)
My pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leavin'
In fact, I got fired 'cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery, the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up (Sup?)
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foamin' at the mouth
I was straight tweakin', the next weekend we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleedin'
You know the reasons but still'll never know my life
Kendrick a.k.a. ""Compton's Human Sacrifice""
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin' shit since the '80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt-nakeds
Dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit
Block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it's Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, yeah, that's cool
Shit, the hood took me under, so I follow the rules
But, yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep colors is doin' the same thang
Pass it to the left, so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-bys in the hood lately, yeah
Couple of IV's with the fuckin' spray-can
Shots in the crowd, then everybody ran
Crew I'm finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip, yeah
Trip, we in the hood still
So, loc, grab a strap 'cause, yeah, it's so real, yeah
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grand's where a mothafucka stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen, would you believe me?
Perceive me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons, would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of bein' a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill 'em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizin' the option
Of livin' a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinkin' and drive
Hit the powder, then watch this flame that arrive in his eye
Listen, coward, the concept is aim and then bang it and slide
Out that bitch with deposit, a price on his head, the tithes
Probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough, Compton, USA
Made me an Angel on Angel Dust, what?
​m.A.A.d city

Nigga, pass Dot the bottle, damn
You ain't the one that got fucked up
What you holdin' it for?

Now, I done grew up round some people livin' their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feel, some people wanna kill their sorrow
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, lookin' to make a vow soon
That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup I see the crowd mood
Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me
Nigga, why you babysittin' only two or three shots?
I'ma show you how to turn it up a notch
First, you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
All the girls wanna play Baywatch
I got a swimming pool full of liquor and they dive in it

I am your conscience, if you do not hear me then you will be history, Kendrick
I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes
I see the feelin', the freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
This how you capitalize, this is parental advised, and apparently, I'm over-influenced
By what you are doin', I thought I was doin' the most 'til someone said to me

And I got hunger pain that grow insane, tell me, do that sound familiar?
If it do, then you're like me, makin' excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of a bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you jokin', why you laugh? Don't you feel bad? I prob'ly sleep
And never ever wake up, never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust, but just when I thought I had enough

I got, I got, I got, I got—
Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain, and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle, though, ambition flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got—
Realness, I just kill shit ’cause it's in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that’s him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you's a, you's a, you's a—
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don't exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I've been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction
Burners, boosters, burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier’s DNA (I’m a soldier's DNA)
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn’t have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I'm gon' shine like I’m supposed to, antisocial extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power's here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
You might also like
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
This is why I say that hip hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a better life, I'm rollin' several dice, fuck your life
I-I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I live a be-, fuck your life
Five, four, three, two, one
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin'
Money and power, the mecca of marriages
Tell me somethin'
You mothafuckas can't tell me nothin'
I'd rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you in the Matrix
Dodgin' bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin' up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin' in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy, walkin' in the buildin'
Diamond in the ceilin', marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I've been goin' hammer
Dodgin' paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin' sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin' all the fakes
Phone never on, I don't conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder—these are the breaks
These are the times, level number nine
Look up in the sky, ten is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain't shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain't sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder—our DNA

He'll make it (He'll make it)
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
Woah (Woah)
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'

I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!,"" X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (No mo')
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him

Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
""I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed.""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap

The great American flag is wrapped and dragged with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street

It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge

I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock

I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast
Like this in a long time, don't you see that long line?
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream, ""It's alive!""
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe

Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad (He mad!), but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question

Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?

King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—(What's the yams?)

The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
(Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (Oh no!)
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (A two-man cell)
Something's in the water (Something's in the water)
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller (Oh yeah!)

Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (Oh yeah)

By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*

Every second, every minute, man, I swear that she can get it
Say, if you a bad bitch, put your hands up high
Hands up high, hands up high
Tell 'em dim the lights down right now, put me in the mood
I'm talkin' 'bout dark room, perfume
Go, go

I recognize your fragrance, hol' up, you ain't never gotta say shit, uh
And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty
Of champagne, cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that
She wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Nigga, don't approach her with that Atari, nigga, that ain't good game, homie, sorry
They say conversation rule a nation, I can tell
But I could never right my wrongs 'less I write it down for real, PS

Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright

I really hope you play this 'cause, oh, girl, you test my patience
With all these seductive photographs and all these one-off vacations
You've been takin', clearly a lot for me to take in, it don't make sense
Young East African girl, you too busy fuckin' witcha other man
I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane, take you and your momma to the motherland, I could do it
Maybe one day when you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it's alright here in the city and you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin' that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell
But I can never right my wrongs unless I write 'em down for real, PS

Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want

You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it
And I know just, know just, know just, know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song, alright
Every time I write these words they become a taboo
Makin' sure my punctuation curve, every letter here's true
Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, I'm talkin'
Poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines
Sincerely, yours truly, and right before you go blind, PS

Anytime
You can get it, you can get it, you can get it, you can get it

A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!""
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope— 
You might also like
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told""
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me

Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh

""Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?""
""Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!""
""Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time.""
""We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga.""
""Bring a nigga back a black!""
""Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga... Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back.""
""Bring a nigga back a black!""
(*Hangs up*)
""Ahh, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?""
""Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now.""
""Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!""

Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?

Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power (Money is power)
Yours is ours (Yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst

What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst

Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins, for I not know—)
My best days, I stress days
Say ""fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say ""See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
""Lord God, I come to You a sinner""
(Lord God, I come to You a sinner)
""And I humbly repent for my sins""
(And I humbly repent for my sins)
""I believe that Jesus is Lord""
(I believe that Jesus is Lord)
""I believe You raised Him from the dead""
(I believe You raised Him from the dead)
""I would ask that Jesus come into my life""
(I would ask that Jesus come in my life)
""And be my Lord and Savior""
(And be my Lord and Savior)
""I receive Jesus to take control of my life""
(I receive Jesus to take control of my life)
""And that I may live for Him from this day forward""
(And that I may live for Him from this day forward)
""Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood""
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
""In Jesus' name, amen""
(In Jesus' name, amen)
Alright now, remember this day

Everything black, I don't want black (They want us to bow)
I want everything black, I ain't need black (Down to our knees)
Some white, some Black, I ain't mean black (And pray to the God)
I want everything black (We don't believe)
Everything black, want all things black
I don't need black, want everything black
Don't need black, our eyes ain't black
I own black, own everything black

Six in the morn'
Fire in the street
Burn, baby, burn (You, you, you, you, you)
That's all I wanna see (You, you, you, you, you)
And sometimes I get off watchin' you die in vain
It's such a shame, they may call me crazy
They may say I suffer from schizophrenia or somethin'
But homie, you made me (You, you, you, you, you)
Black don't crack, my nigga
I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
Been feelin' this way since I was sixteen, came to my senses
You never liked us anyway, fuck your friendship, I meant it
I'm African-American, I'm African, I'm black as the moon
Heritage of a small village, pardon my residence
Came from the bottom of mankind
My hair is nappy, my dick is big, my nose is round and wide
You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You're fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I'm a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin' my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin' a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

I said they treat me like a slave cah me Black
Woi, we feel a whole heap of pain cah we Black
And man a say they put me inna chains cah we Black
Imagine now, big gold chains full of rocks
How you no see the whip, left scars 'pon me back
But now we have a big whip parked 'pon the block
All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
Once I finish this, witnesses will convey just what I mean
I mean, it's evident that I'm irrelevant to society
That's what you're tellin' me, penitentiary would only hire me
Curse me 'til I'm dead, church me with your fake prophesizing
That I'ma be just another slave in my head
Institutionalized manipulation and lies
Reciprocation of freedom only live in your eyes
You hate me, don't you?
I know you hate me just as much as you hate yourself
Jealous of my wisdom and cards I dealt
Watchin' me as I pull up, fill up my tank, then peel out
Muscle cars like pull-ups, show you what these big wheels 'bout, ah
Black and successful, this black man meant to be special
Katzkins on my radar, bitch, how can I help you?
How can I tell you I'm making a killin'?
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice
The blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice

All them say we doomed from the start cah we Black
Remember this, every race start from the block, jus 'member dat

I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015
When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it's generational hatred
It's genocism, it's grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I'm African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I'm Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you — no, fuck y'all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it's threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin' maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin' with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don't matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET 'cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

Is this mic on? (Hey, move this way, this way)
Hey, Hey! Hey! Turn the mic up, c'mon, c'mon
Is the mic on or not? I want the mic
We're bringing up nobody, nobody
Nobody but the number one rapper in the world
He done traveled all over the world
He came back just to give you some game
All of the little boys and girls, come up here
(Ah, one two, one two, what's happening, fool?)
Come right here, this is for you, come on up
I done been through a whole lot (Kendrick Lamar!)
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil wanna put me in a bow tie (Make some noise, brother!)
Pray that the holy water don't go dry
As I look around me
So many motherfuckers wanna down me
But enemigo never drown me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me
And (I love myself)
Huh, when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
(I love myself)
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't seem shy

Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on the scheme, uh

I duck these cold faces, post up fi-fie-fo-fum basis
Dreams of reality's peace (Oh, yeah)
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky could fall down, wind could cry now
Look at me motherfucker I smile-
And (I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?

Baby, what about you? Come on

(Crazy, what you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep moving, (Keep moving) turn the mic up
(Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confidence, everybody lack confidence
How many times my potential was anonymous?
How many times the city making me promises?
So I promise this, nigga
(I love myself)
Uh, and when you lookin' at me, tell me what do you see?
(I love myself)
Ahh, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police

I went to war last night
With an automatic weapon, don't nobody call a medic
I'ma do it 'til I get it right (Oh no)
I went to war last night (Night, night, night, night)
I've been dealing with depression ever since an adolescent
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could never take the lead, I could never bob and weave
From a negative and letting them annihilate me
And it's evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body—
(Offstage Argument)
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids, bro
2015, niggas tired of playin' victim, dog
Niggas ain't trying to play vic— TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
How many— Yan-Yan, how many we done lost?
No for real, answer the que—, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This—, this year alone
Exactly, so we— we ain't got time to waste time, my nigga
Niggas gotta make time, bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
The judge make time so it ain’t shit
It shouldn’t be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that, bro
You know that
It's— it's mando, right, it's mando
And I s— I— And I— And I say this because I love you niggas, man
I love all my niggas, bro
Exac— enough said, enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on, because that shit petty, my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon' do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen, listen to this:

I promised Dave I'd never use the phrase ""fuck nigga""
He said, ""Think about what you saying: ""Fuck niggas""
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty; king royalty - wait listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don't recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time

Uh-uh, fuck that

Eight doobies to the face, fuck that
Twelve bottles in the case, nigga, fuck that
Two pills and a half-weight, nigga, fuck that
Got a high tolerance when your age don't exist

Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feelin' that he feel today
You know when you part of Section.80
You feel like no one can relate
'Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana endorphins make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin' cough syrup like it's water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one of our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
'Less it comes with an 808 (A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank (Technology bought my soul)
Lookin' around and all I see is a big crowd that's product of me
And they probably relatives relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is Black, she Black too
Purple Label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head, then she look at me
She got ADHD

Woah-woah, woah, woah-woah, woah (Don't got a limit, just give me some more with it)
(They always told me ADHD did it)
Woah, woah-woah

And then she started
And then she started feelin' herself like no one else in this apartment
""Beg your pardon? Oh, I rap, baby, how old are you?""
She say twenty-two, I say twenty-three, ""Okay, then we are crack babies,"" damn
""Why you say that?"" She said, ""Where my drink at?""
""I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors and the police relax""
I stood up, shut the blind, closed the screen, Jumbotron
Made to the back where she reside, then she said, ""Read between the lines,"" yep
Hope that I get close enough when the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up when the Nuvo start to drown
Her body, and I know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It's nothin' we can do now, somebody walked in with a pound (Woah)
Of that Bay Area kush, she looked at me, then looked
At it, then she grabbed it, then she said, ""Get it understood""
""You know why we crack babies? Because we born in the '80s
The ADHD crazy""

Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ""The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart""
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...

Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Earth is no more, won’t you burn this muh’fucka?

With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice

Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things

If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs

Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
(Pull them panties to the side now)
Now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines

I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
Damn

God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all

Verse 2 says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America
I love you, family, and I pray for you
God bless you

Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy, every nigga is a star
Every nigga is a star, ayy
Who will deny that you and I and every nigga is a star?
Hit me!
When the four corners of this cocoon collide
You'll slip through the cracks hopin' that you'll survive
Gather your wit, take a deep look inside
Are you really who they idolize?
To Pimp a Butterfly

At first, I did love you
But now I just wanna fuck
Late nights thinkin' of you
Until I get my nut
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
You might also like
When I get signed, homie, I'ma act a fool
Hit the dance floor, strobe lights in the room
Snatch your little secretary bitch for the homies
Blue-eyed devil with a fat-ass monkey
I'ma buy a brand new Caddy on vogues
Trunk the hood up, two times, deuce-four
Platinum on everythin', platinum on weddin' ring
Married to the game and a bad bitch chose
When I get signed, homie, I'ma buy a strap
Straight from the CIA, set it on my lap
Take a few M-16s to the hood
Pass 'em all out on the block, what's good?
I'ma put the Compton swap meet by the White House
Republican run up, get socked out
Hit the press with a Cuban link on my neck
Uneducated, but I got a million-dollar check like that
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
(Everybody get out)
At first, I did love you (Love you)
But now I just wanna fuck (I just wanna fuck)
Late nights thinkin' of you (Of you)
Until I get my nut ('Til I get my nut)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board (Across the board)
Destroyed, but what for?
Yo, what's up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keepin' it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anythin', see, my name is Uncle Sam, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (That's why I'm kind)
Don't have receipts (Oh, man, that's fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché? Then say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white-collar in you
But it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you
Because you make me live forever, baby
Count it all together, baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better, baby
Your horoscope is a Gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two C-notes
Too much ain't enough, both we know
Christmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it, Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five
Yeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)
Lookin' good when you're on top (We’re on top together)
You got a medal for us
Leavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home
We should never gave
We should never gave niggas money
Go back home, money, go back home

Easy money
It's about to be a surgical summer
Chop the tops off the coupes
The cuatrociento' ochenta y ocho
The Spider joint
And you know we gotta cut the heads off these snakes, right?
Watch the body drop

Drug dealin' aside, ghostwritin' aside
Let's have a heart-to-heart about your pride
Even though you're multi, I see that your soul don't look alive
The M's count different when Baby divides the pie, wait
Let's examine why
Your music for the past few years been angry and full of lies
I'll start it at the home front, ""I'm On One""
Dennis Graham stay off the 'Gram, bitch, I'm on one
You mention wedding ring like it's a bad thing
Your father walked away at five—hell of a dad thing
Marriage is somethin' that Sandi never had, Drake
How you a winner but she keep comin' in last place?
Monkey-suit Dennis, you parade him
A Steve Harvey-suit nigga made him
Confused, always felt you weren't Black enough
Afraid to grow it 'cause your 'fro wouldn't nap enough
Since you name-dropped my fiancée
Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyoncé
Sophie knows better as your baby mother
Cleaned her up for IG, but the stench is on her
A baby's involved, it's deeper than rap
We talkin' character, let me keep with the facts
You are hiding a child, let that boy come home
Deadbeat mothafucka playin' border patrol, ooh
Adonis is your son
And he deserves more than an Adidas press run; that's real
Love that baby, respect that girl
Forget she's a pornstar, let her be your world, yuugh!
How dare you put Ye in my verses?
I'm selfish, I want all of the curses
I'm pre-bookin' the churches, me versus three hearses
If we all go to Hell, it'll be worth it
Already aligned with the greats, and on that same note
The only ones I chase are two ghosts
Still givin' you classics, that's the only thing that dates me
OVO 40, hunched over like he 80—tick, tick, tick
How much time he got? That man is sick, sick, sick
I got the devil flow, nigga—six-six-six
Surgical summer with it—snip, snip, snip
And you don't really want it with him

(W-W-W-What is it?)

Twenty-plus years of selling Johnson & Johnson
I started out as a baby-faced monster
No wonder it's diaper rash on my conscience
My teething ring was numbed by that nonsense
Gem Star razor and a dinner plate
Arm & Hammer and a Mason jar, that's my dinner date
Then crack the window in the kitchen, let it ventilate
'Cause I let it sizzle on the stove like a minute steak
Nigga, I was crack in the school zone
Two beepers on me, Starter jacket that was two-toned
Four lockers, four different bitches got they mule on
Black Ferris Bueller, cuttin' school with his jewels on
Couldn't do wrong with a chest full of chains and an arm full of watches
What I sell for pain in the hood, I'm a doctor
Zhivago, tried to fight the urge
Like Ivan Drago, ""If he dies, he dies""
Like Doughboy to Tre, if he rides, he rides
Throwin' punches in his room, if he cries, he cries
We don't drink away the pain when a nigga die
We add a link to the chain, inscribe a nigga name in your flesh
We playin' on a higher game of chess
Once you delegate his bills, who gon' fuck his bitch the best?
A million megapixels of the Pyrex
Started on the scale, digital my only Timex
Nigga, this is timeless, simply 'cause it's honest
Pure as the fumes that be fuckin' with my sinus
Nigga, this is Simon Says, Simon Red

Instrumentals from my mama's Christmas party
Trouble's on my mind
I still smell crime, my little brother cryin'
Smokers repeatedly buying my Sega Genesis
Either that or my auntie was stealin' it
Hit the pipe and start feelin' it
Ooh-wee, cut me some slack, weed never did that
This was different, jeez louise, please help me relax
Quantum physics could never show you the world I was in
When I was ten, back when nine ounces had got you ten
And nine times out of ten, niggas don't pay attention
And when it's tension in the air, nines come with extensions
My daddy turned a quarter-piece to a four and a half
Took an L, started sellin' soap fiends bubble bath
Broke his nails misusin' his pinky to treat his nose
Shirt buttoned open, taco meat laying on his gold
I said, ""Daddy, one day, I'ma get you right with thirty-six zips
One thousand grams of cocaine, then your name will be rich
Now you can rock it up or sell it soft as leather interior
Drop some ice cubes in it, Deebo on perimeter""
He said, ""Son, how come you think you'll be my connect?""
I said, ""Pops, your ass is washed up, with all due respect""
He said, ""Well, nigga, then show me how it all makes sense""
Go figure, motherfucker, every verse is a brick
Your son dope, nigga
Now reap what you sowed, nigga (Please reap what you sowed, nigga)
I was born in '87, my granddaddy a legend

The game's fucked up
Niggas’ beats is bangin', nigga, ya hooks did it
The lyric pennin' equal the Trumps winnin’
The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until ""Annie""
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy
'Cause I'm ’posed to juggle these flows and nose candy (yugh)
Ferrari, my 40th, blew the candles out
Tom Brady’d you niggas, I had to scramble out
They be ridin' these waves, I pulled my sandals out
Jefe Latin my Grammy, I went the Spanish route
Oh, now it’s okay to kill Baby?
Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I'm the liar?
Shit, I’ve been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire
Now who do you admire?

Them prices ain't real without inflation
I done flew it, I done grew it, been a conduit

Let Steven talk streamin' and Shazam numbers
I'll ensure that you gettin' every gram from us
Let's cram numbers, easily

Beef is best served like steak: well done
Get a gun in your face, bitch nigga
Beef will have you praying to God
Move your kids, have you hiding your mom
Beef is when you hide behind them other niggas
But they ain't killers they ain't pullin' them triggers, fuck niggas
Beef will have you keying our cars
Heartbroke, yours don't look like ours

Them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
Throwing that flag up running around you hot shit
Taking half of everything you get
Yeah them niggas ain't dying for you
Them niggas ain't dying for you
And we know that

Contract all fucked up
I guess that means you all fucked up
You signed to one nigga that signed to another nigga
That's signed to three niggas, now that's bad luck
Damn that shit even the odds now
You better off selling this hard now
You call it living out your dreams
You can't fly without your wings
You get it
Jeremy Scott's all camouflaged
You can't hide it from yourselves, career sabotaged
I was really in that Travelodge
You just lying through your catalogues
Where the blood and the battle scars
We the ones that judge juggling the gavels on
Put me to the body, nigga
First 48 put us to them bodies, nigga
Round here we don't play that
A to the K that, spray that, lay back
You can keep your beats, nigga
We'd much rather share your bitch, nigga, bitch nigga
3 million can't hide that
It shows in the homes I done tried that
That's why you'll never be my neighbors
Smile as you waving but we know you niggas hate us
Fuck you playing games for
Don't be scared get everything you came for
They got you talking that big shit
Little do you know we don't miss shit
Them niggas using you as a pawn
You see they never loaded they guns
Now you out here all by yourself

Came from the bottom, no one said it would be fair
Now I'm on this money, loungin' like it's a beach chair
Papa don't preach, a-all we do is just reach here
Raised 'round killers, we just happy to be here
Spot 'em, got 'em, let your soul pay your dues
While my hoes doin' magic, voodoo Moulin Rouge
That's a tactic that they use, fuck 'em high, then suck 'em dry
Before you know it, her Q7 is buzzin' by

Valentino summers and wave runners
Chains on my niggas like slave runners
Drug dealers anonymous
How many Madonnas can that Mazda fit?
My brick talk is more than obvious, it’s ominous
Garages, the phantom, ghouls, ghosts and goblins
Blonde mohawk the collection I’m Dennis Rodman
The money count is the only moment of silence
Cause hush money balances all this drugs and violence
Hat trick under my mattress
Date I stop still has an asterisk after it
After all I can make a call
I can baptize a brick
As I wash away my sins like a catholic
Who the fuck ain't mastered this
America’s nightmare's in Flint
Children of a lesser God when your melanin’s got a tint
And I can’t even mention what I sent or what I spent
'Cause my name in 18 wheelers is evidence
I put my boos in those cruise collections
Life’s a bitch
A to Z on her shoe collection, take your pick
Paid in full like ’86, Gs on my body
The new Gucci has less monograms, God’s got him
Let he without sin cast the first stone
So I built that all glass quad level first home
Shatter all of your misconceptions
Hold all of them missing weapons
You thought I would miss my blessing

Pass codes, we past this
Pass time, Presidential
Rolexes, both sexes
Blue bezel we both flexing
Big diamonds, we Bowflexing
Pitch dope, touch down
Both sports, I'm Bo Jackson
Your bitch fronting, that's you
My bitch stunting, that's me
I break it down, then break her off
I'm breaking bread, and that's key
We everything that they talk about
Know them haters be watching
Them bitches lurking -- your page locked
And they still know when you shopping
They still know that I'm balling
You still know that I'm all in
Your ex nigga, your next nigga
Gon' hate the fact that I'm spoiling
Whoo! But you earned that
Now where the fuck did you learn that?
We turnt up, we turnt out
We too far gone to ever turn back
These women ain't shit but hoes with tricks
Baby girl, you different
When you're not around, it feels like something's missing
And I know you keep it real
Never tell no lie
Know you heard what they say
True love is hard to find
I just might trust you with my drugs
Trust you with my money
Just might trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Girl, I'll trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money
Might just trust you with my drugs
Might trust you with my money, girl

Please don't mind
I just need some time
These requirements
Just gotta make sure you meet all mine
Standing there staring, with your bow-legged stance
Trust being nothing you could hold in your hand
Hustle in the hood, strong with the bands
Look at you as something more than a ho I could smash
Or being something bad I could bone at the bag
Pole in my pants standing at attention
When you step out of the shower and your ass is wiggling
Glance at the ceiling
Now your glass is empty
Thinking backwards, really
I done grabbed a vixen
That supposed to be a fitter after video
Stacks'll really blow
Dancers get exposed
Missing you when you not around
We text each other when out of town
You remain the same no matter up or down
These other women stay pretending
Money come and they help us spend it
But'll fuck my niggas in the very minute
I was down and out and had to go to prison
Kinda high role play, acki
And again I say I like these hoes14Embed",https://images.genius.com/6e863462f9401219e3773b05eb383f11.1000x1000x1.jpg

Drug dealer Benzes with gold diggers in 'em
In elevator condos, on everything I love

This ain't a wave or phase, 'cause all that shit fades
This lifestyle's forever when you made
They tweet about the length I made 'em wait
What the fuck you expect
When a nigga got a cape and he's great?
Oven's full of cakes that he bakes, still spreadin' paste
The love just accentuates the hate
This is for my bodybuildin' clients movin' weight
Just add water, stir it like a shake
Play amongst the stars like the roof in the Wraith
Get the table next to mine, make our bottle servers race

These are the games we play, we are the names they say
This is the drug money your ex-nigga claim he makes

To all of my young niggas, I am your Ghost and your Rae
This is my Purple Tape, save up for rainy days
And baby mama wishes, along with the side bitches
They try to coexist, end up wishin' you'd die, bitches
Stood on every couch, in the A at the black party
No jewelry on, but you richer than everybody
You laugh a little louder, the DJ say your name a little prouder
And we don't need a globe to show you the world is ours
We can bet a hundred thousand with my safe hold
My numbers lookin' like a bank code

Ain't no stoppin' this champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin', the laws from watchin'
With Ye back choppin', the cars and the women come with options
Caviar facials remove the toxins
This ain't for the conscious, this is for the mud-made monsters
Who grew up on legends from outta Yonkers
Influenced by niggas straight outta Compton, the scale never lies
I'm two-point-two incentivised
If you ain't energized like the bunny for drug money
Or been paralyzed by the sight of a drug mummy
This ain't really for you, this is for the Goya Montoya
Who said I couldn't stop, then afforded me all the lawyers
The only kingpin who ain't sinkin'
Chess moves are made, my third eye ain't blinkin
Stay woke, nigga, or get out
Still pull them whips out, still spread the chips out
Might buy your bitch some new hips and yank her rib out
The message in this music, all my niggas had to live out

The Colgate kilo, the hood needs whitening (Skrrt)
We fishscale niggas like we all Pisces
Your bitch in my bubble like I'm still typing
She hopin' that you let her go like a kite string
Your eco-friendly jewelers, you keep recycling
Cartier bustdowns just not my thing
The B in the center of that left and right wing
The only time you'll ever see me next to Breitling (Skrrt)

They put me on lists with these niggas inexplicably
I put your mansion on my wall, are you shittin' me?

We got different Saab stories, save your soliloquies

Never trust a bitch who finds love in a camera
She will fuck you, then turn around and fuck a janitor
Set the parameters
You either with the pro ballers or the amateurs
I won't let you ruin my dreams or Harvey Weinstein the kid
Good mornin', Matt Lauer—can I live?
Look at my new digs
The rooftop can host a paint-and-sip for, like, forty
The Warhols on my wall paint a war story
Had to find other ways to invest
'Cause you rappers found every way to ruin Pateks
It's a nightmare, yeah
I'm too rare amongst all of this pink hair, ooh!
Still do the Fred Astaire on a brick
Tap-tap, throw the phone if you hear it click
Art Basel-in' the bezel
Your bustdown is bust-down and don't match the metal
Lower level's where you settle at
I'm the pot callin' the kettle black
Where there's no brake pedals at
Between God and where the Devil's at
Had to double-dutch and double back
Then hopscotch through where the trouble's at
Exactly what the game's been missin'
This fire burns hot as Hell's Kitchen

Blunted in a 600, blunted in a 600

Yuugh, I drops every blue moon
To separate myself from you kings of the YouTube
I am more U2, I am like Bono with the Edge
In Mexico, fuck Donald and his pledge
Legend has it, the wrist is magic
The left is Patek, Philippe's replaced by Matsuhisa
Ignore most requests for the feature
Unless it’s getting played on the beach in Ibiza
While she fucking Nesha and she sucking shisha
Can’t you see my Total; Pam, Kima, Keisha
I’m aiming for the moguls, why y'all niggas aiming at the locals?
And rap niggas broke like them, they’re mere hopeful
Still wishing on a star
The last one to find out that Baby own the cars
The final trilogy of Jaws
The grills like, interior gauze
It feels like, still white
Matching Missoni looks African on me
They tryin’ pin this trafficking on me like Mano and Tony
My thoughts spilling over
The soft ceiling’s open, I Cross-Fit the coca

Scoring from the heights but I wanted mine purer

No reading, no writing, made us savage of men

Droppin' a thousand ain't much

On a missile to turn this whole town into dust
Don't make a sound, baby, hush
I am the living swipe right, on the mic I'm a slut
I don't know how to not spit like a lout
I'll spill a pound of my kids on your couch

Half of a mongrel and mythical team
Villainous treacherous things
Legend says El is a spawn out of Hell
The myth is my mama's a murderous queen
Your life can end like in Godfather 1
You get the gun as I christen my son
If I die today and it's Hell I should pay
Tell the Lord ""Mikey said, ""Fuck, it was fun""""
Every new record's my dick in a box
We get a doozy, the moola's a lock
You're getting used to me doing no wrong

You wanna kick it, I'll give you the rocks

I'll pull a sword on you simps
Just with a flick of the wrist
Get your neck giving up mist
Me and Mike skip away whistlin' and grin
Every day's golden when you only win

Bullyin' bastards and beatin' on beats
Sounds like a day at the beach, preach
I keep it middle school, step on your feet
Before you can speak, blaow! to the teeth

We move among the ones you think are meek
You think I'm lion, you right, see my teeth
Don't be a bore when I'm roaring vamoose
Hunting's no fun when your prey doesn't move

Fashion slave, you protestin' to get in a fuckin' look book
Everything I scribble's like an anarchist's cookbook
Look good, posin' in the centerfold of Crook Book
Black on black on black with the ski mask, that is my crook look
How you like my stylin' bruh? Ain't nobody smilin' bruh
'Bout to turn this mothafucka up like Riker's Island, bruh
Where my thuggers and my crippers and my blooders and my brothers?
When you niggas gon' unite and kill the police, motherfuckers?
Or take over a jail, give them COs hell
The burnin' of the sulfur, goddamn, I love the smell
Blanket to pillow torchin', where the fuck the warden?
And when you find him, we don't kill him, we just waterboard him
We killin' them for freedom 'cause they tortured us for boredom
And even if some good ones die, fuck it, the Lord'll sort 'em

We, we out of order, your honor, you're out of order
This whole court is unimportant, you fuckers are walkin' corpses
I'm a flip wig synonym livin' within distortion
I'll bite into a cyanide molar before you whores win
I'm a New Yorkian, I'm fucked from the jump
I wear my Yankee so tilted I actually walk with a hunch

A wise man once said, ""We all dead, fuck it""
Just spit it disgustin', youngin', and hold your nuts while you gunnin'
I listened, tatted the sentence on my dick last summer
Now I'll never get that phrase off my brain, it's no wonder
I'm here to buy hearts, I got hundreds, honey
The cheaper the parts, the better buy for the money
I'm trained in vagina whisperin', glistenin'
Waitin' for their christenin'
I know the neighbors can't help but listen in, uh
A dirty boy who come down on the side of dissonance
I can't even relax without sirens off in the distances
Not shittin' you, little buddy, this fuckin' island's a prison
The only solace I have is the act of conjugal visiting
My solitary condition's preventin' conjugal visits
Though mainly missin' my missus, they keepin' me from my children
Conditions create a villain, the villain is given vision
The vision becomes a vow to seek vengeance on all the vicious
Liars and politicians, profiteers of the prisons
The forehead engravers, enslavers of men and women
Including members of clergy that rule on you through religion
So strip your kids to the nude and then tell 'em God'll forgive 'em

Call her a skin job and my honey dip will backflip for you
You playin' God, your eye sockets she gon' rip into
We sick of bleeding now the trey spray and victim you

Dump cases when facing to cop pleas when we seizing the pump
With reason to dump on you global grand dragons

Blew up the spot with that new bop

I don't wanna sound unkind but the sounds I make
Are the sounds of the hounds that are howling
Under your bed, I'm here growling
Same time, under the blanket, you're cowering

Cowering like cowards cowering in
Concrete showers in Rikers Island
Victims, we the wolves that's wilding
We often smilin' at sights of violence
Acting brave and courageous
Ain't advantageous for health and safety
So when we say, ""Run the jewels""
Just run 'em, baby, please don't delay me
And that goes for a guy or lady
The fam, goddamn, we fuckin' crazy

Get a crowd to they feet and a soul to its options
I'm a fool for the win, I been made
To be loud while these other cats drowning in softness
In a urn or the dirt get tossed in
With a grin or a smirk, get accosted

Or a nun in a cumshot—stop it
Big beast in a cage with a heart full of rage
It seems I can't behave
You could try 'til you die, oh well
You failed, it seems the world can't be saved

You can all run naked backwards through a field of dicks
Fuck the world, don't ask me for shit, that's word to B.I.G

But I've woken up and it don't exist
Soak it in, I need no assist

Me and El-P got time to kill
Got folks to kill, on overkill
He hangin' out the window, I hold the wheel

I'm talkin' crazy, half past the clock is cuckoo
You rappers doodoo, baby shit, just basic boo boo
I'm Shaka Zulu, Mansa Musa, my money's beaucoup
My beats is bangin', fuck what you rappin', who produced you?
I slapped the snot, take what ya got and Run The Jewels you

You itsy bitsy, furry frightened and frickin' sickly
A little prickly, dick on display for winter swimming
Look at these kiddies, Mike, I'ma rat-a-tat 'em for livin'
I deal in dirty work; do the deed and then dash—ditch 'em
I'd lend a hand but it's stuck in a fist and gun position
We run a brand where destruction's the number one commitment
It's all a joke between mom contractions and coffin fittings
So we disappear into smoke like we're fuckin' magicians

No hocus pocus, you simple suckers been served a notice
Top of the mornin', my fist to your face is fuckin' Folgers
We might be giants, standin' on little dandy shoulders
You punks is pussy, proverbial pansy panty holders

Get a dose, a dirty code to go, been cold since Co-Flow
Got a wire or two unlodgin', I'll set a fire down below
I'll hang it up when you say, ""Sorry, I didn't know""
Prolly got a year or ten to go, so let's go
I don't really know how to go slow
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker's cold (Ayy)
You in the wrong mode, you open and closin' your hole, it's a no go
This whole world's a shit moat, filled to the brim like Gitmo
When you think it don't get mo' low it limbo 'til the sticks on flo'
All oppression's born of lies, I don't make the rules, I’m just one guy
All due respect, if getting spit on's how respect is now defined
Hungry for truth but you got screwed and drank the Kool-Aid, there's a line
It end directly at the edge of a mass grave, that's their design
Funny fact about a cage, they're never built for just one group
So when that cage is done with them and you still poor, it come for you
The newest lowest on the totem, well golly gee, you have been used
You helped to fuel the death machine that down the line will kill you too (Oops)
Pseudo-Christians, y'all indifferent, kids in prisons ain't a sin? Shit
If even one scrap of what Jesus taught connected, you'd feel different
What a disingenuous way to piss away existence, I don't get it
I'd say you lost your goddamn minds if y'all possessed one to begin with

We back on our shit, and it's cold as fuck

The way I see it, you're probably freest from the ages one to four
Around the age of five you're shipped away for your body to be stored
They promise education, but really they give you tests and scores
And they predictin' prison population by who scoring the lowest
And usually the lowest scores the poorest and they look like me
And every day on the evening news, they feed you fear for free
And you so numb, you watch the cops choke out a man like me
Until my voice goes from a shriek to whisper, ""I can't breathe""
And you sit there in the house on couch and watch it on TV
The most you give's a Twitter rant and call it a tragedy
But truly the travesty, you've been robbed of your empathy
Replaced it with apathy, I wish I could magically
Fast forward the future so then you can face it
And see how fucked up it'll be
I promise I'm honest
They coming for you the day after they comin' for me
I'm readin' Chomsky, I read Bukowski, I'm layin' low for a week
I said somethin' on behalf of my people and I popped up in Wikileaks
Thank God that I'm covered, the devil come smothered
And you know the evil don't sleep
Dick Gregory told me a couple of secrets before he laid down in his grave
All of us serve the same masters, all of us nothin' but slaves
Never forget in the story of Jesus, the hero was killed by the state
Just got done walkin' in the snow
Goddamn, that motherfucker cold
Just got done walkin' in the snow

Smoke from the loosie drift, hold it like a crucifix
Blow from the nose, I'm a dragon to a gnome
Got a average of being excellent; the median just dope
Like the ratio of heroin to laxative that's sold
Authorities have spoken, demanded your pure devotion
Get magnetized to the ground while the falcons of murder close in
I chose to go guano, y'all know, kinda batshit
The bright lights of fuckery stuck in me, automatic
I’ll teabag a piranha tank, heart barely beatin'
A wild one who’ll swim like directly after he's eaten
While holdin' a toaster oven that's plugged with a fork in it
'Cause death by electrocution's like life in New York, i'n it?
Should've been a dentist, mom said it pain's the way that my craft expresses
Born in a little shop of horrors that I can't even afford to rent in
Where's the exit?
Wanna talk shop, I can chop it up with X-Acto touch
What's the rush?
Autograph skin flaps, tag 'em up
I don't brag enough, you de facto suck
A lot of you new to the El Producto milieu
Kinda like, ""Fuck is you?""
I'm a little black spot on a sun of lies
But I'm not too high to say I'm the truth
I line the booth to catch blood like a Bateman
Nathan sacred, I'll mace a play pen
Jewel runner, bitch, make the name stick
Not for sale, but I'm taking payments

Good pussy, good marijuana that be my medicine
And I'm a mixture of MJG and the Weathermen
A revolutionary bangin' on my adversaries
And I love Dr. King but violence might be necessary
'Cause when you live on MLK and it gets very scary
You might have to pull your AK, send one to the cemetery
We overworked, underpaid, and we underprivileged
They love us, they love us (Why?)
Because we feed the village
You really made it or just became a prisoner of privilege?
You willin' to share that information that you've been given?
Like who really run this?

If I got a billi' and the bitch recordin' me, I'm like, ""Who cares?""
What I wouldn't be is on TV stutterin' ta-ta-talkin' scared
So the question is when Don's at home with that traitor ass bitch alone

That was me in BK on Atlantic
Never looked both ways, ran in traffic
Pops went away but I stayed, vagrant
Placed where the steel and cement became nature
Love what you did with the place, it looks gorgeous
Cityscape where the blood of good men courses
And the dreamers are bull trapped in porcelain
Take a knee to the gods and get horse shit
Wanna live for the thrill? They'll arrange it
Got a bevy of imps to spit hatred
Shit'll get in your head and cause panic
Have you desperately begging to get famous
Get your dignity dirty and left orphaned
Sanity on the fringe of distorted
Who are they to just take shit and hoard it?
Who am I that I don't get my portion?
The most impressionable minds
Get molested and informed by manipulating forces
Don't fret, little man, don't cry
They can never take the energy inside you were born with
Knowing that, understand you could never be poor
You already won the war, you were born rich
You can only take the energy you had
Going back to the realm or the home where your lord is
Whoever, whatever that lord is
Couldn't give a fuck if you ever made fortunes
Fuck anyone ever tryin' to run that bum shit
Send 'em to the flames where the orcs live
Them and the lost minds thinking they're smarter than us
Don't understand love's importance
And we can weaponize that, bring 'em back to the truth
Where the ashes and dust got formed in

The beat breaks and your teeth break
Keep your canines embedded in my knuckles as a keepsake
It would seem your veneers just mere souvenirs
Falling out your mouth and on to the landscape
Me and El-P do the secret handshake
Then I pummel punch a pumpkin head punk in his pimple face
'Til he's punch drunk 'cause he's sweet as a pound cake
(Ain't he pussy, Mike?) Yeah, El, I'll say
Into the wild, wild style ghetto child running wild
Where the lions and the owls stay
The powers that be even offered up reprieves
Told us they ain't take us out if we bow to our knees
But they can give that to the kings and the queens
And the worshipers of idols and followers of things
'Cause I would rather be in the jungle with the savages
It's kill or be killed, and I'm working with the averages
My professor emeritus
Say we been cursed being brought to the AmeriKKKas
How you raise a whole human single parent
No marriages, no sense of heritage?
Planned Parenthood helping plan miscarriages
But I'm lucky mommy already had a narrative
Product of a teenage love, my arrogance
Derives from the pride in the job my parents did
Named Mike, I was told it was godlike
Even danced with the devil, came out alright
Okay, honor y'all? No way
Still spell AmeriKKKa with the triple K
Word up to Spice 1 and O'Shea

We return from the depths of the badlands
With a gun and a knife in our waistband
Went to war with the Devil and Shaitan
He wore a bad toupee and a spray tan
So high now, hoping that I land
On a Thai stick, moving through Thailand
On the radio, heard a plane hijack
Government did that like they cooked crack
I move in a world of conspiracies
Obey no rules, I'm doing me
Smoke kush, transport to the airport
Customs found a joint in my passport
Pulled cash and I gave him what he asked for
Goddammit, it's a motherfucking miracle
Small bribe, made it back into America
Hit Uber and maneuvered out the area
Rhyme animal, pit bull terrier
Rap terrorist, terrorize, tear it up
Brought gas and the matches to flare it up
Militant Michael might go psycho
On any ally or rival
Born Black, that's dead on arrival

My dick got a Michelin star, I'm on par with the best ever took the gig
I'm a super cat, from don dada to dusk, don't bother to touch
I got firm clutch on the grip and the bucks
I might ghost ride a tank, take a ride to the bank

Don't flash weak shit to the Shark Tank judge

Beware of horses
I mean a horse is a horse of course, but who rides is important
Sitting high with a uniform, barking orders, demanding order
And I'm scared that I talk too much about what I think's going on
I got a way with this, they might drag me away for this
Put me in a cage for this, I might pay for this
I just say what I want like I'm made for this
But I'm just afraid some days I might be wrong
Maybe that's why me and Mike get along
Hey, not from the same part of town, but we both hear the same sound coming
Woo! And it sounds like war
Woo! And it breaks our hearts
When I started this band, didn't have no plans, didn't see no arc
Just run with the craft, have a couple laughs
Make a buck and dash, yeah
Get a little dap like ""Yeah I'm the fucking man!"", yeah
Maybe give a little back like, ""Here, I do what I can""
It's all jokes and smoke 'till the truth start schemin'
Can't contain the disdain for y'all demons
You talk clean and bomb hospitals
So I speak with the foulest mouth possible
And I drink like a Vulcan losing all faith in the logical
I will not be confused for docile
I'm free, motherfuckers, I'm hostile

Choose the lesser of the evil people, and the devil still gon' win
It could all be over tomorrow, kill our masters and start again
But we know we all afraid, so we just simply cry and march again
At the Dem Conven my heart broke apart when I seen them march mommas in
As I rap this verse right now, got tears flowing down my chocolate chin
Told the truth and I've been punished for it, must be a masochist 'cause I done it again
""Ooh, Mike said 'uterus'""
They acting like Mike said, ""You a bitch""
To every writer who wrote it, misquoted it
Mike says, ""You a bitch, you a bitch, you a bitch""
Add a ""nigga"" for the black writer that started that sewer shit
I maneuver through manure like a slumdog millionaire
El-P told me, ""Fuck them devils, Mike, we gon' be millionaires""
I respond with a heavy ""Yeah""
Big bruh says ""Fuck that, toughen up
Stay ready, write raw raps, shit rugged rough""
The devil don't sleep, us either
El spits fire, I spit ether
We the gladiators that oppose all Caesars
Coming soon on a new world tour
Probably play the score for the World War
At the apocalypse, play the encore
Turn around, see El, and I smile
Hell coming, and we got about a mile
Until it's over I remain hostile

Mere mortals, the Gods coming so miss me with the whoopty-whoop
You take the devil for God, look how he doin' you
I'm Jack Johnson, I beat a slave catcher snaggletooth
I'm Tiger Flowers with a higher power, hallelu'
Life'll get so bad it feel like God mad at you
But that's a feeling, baby, ever lose I refuse
I disabuse these foolish fools of they foolish views
I heard the revolution coming, you should spread the news
Garvey mind, Tyson punch, this is bad news
So feel me, follow me
Devil done got on top of me
Bad times got a monopoly
Give up, I did the opposite
Pitch perfect, did it properly
Owner killed by his property

This life'll stress you like Orson Welles on the radio
War after war of the world'll make all your saneness go
And these invaders from Earth're twerkin' on graves you know
Can't wait to load up the silos and make your babies glow
It's so abusive you'll beg somebody to roofie you
They'll snatch your hope up and use it like it's a hula-hoop
And it's a loop, they talk to you just like their rulers do
These fuckin' fools have forgotten just who been foolin' who

Killer children of men on the throne, roving with no atonement
Got me feeling like I'm Clive Owen rowing through a future frozen
The flow's a burning wind, blowing to your coast
Now in cages 'cause we rode the waves of your explosions
Done appealing to our killers, man, to stop the bleedin'
This song's a dirty bomb for they dirty dealings
Boots on the roof, I'm Charley Mingus dumping through the ceiling
Master P-in' on these lost Europeans thievin'
Shit be grim, and De La born a reaper
Born in the beast and fixin' feast tearin' its features
The world surges, the nation's nervous
The crowds awaken, they can't disperse us
We ain't at your service
Won't stay sedated
Won't state our numbers for names and
Remaining faceless

We ain't asleep, we rope-a-dope through the flames

So fuck you fuckboys forever, I hope I said it politely

You meet another pair better - highly unlikely
And if I can't rap, then maggot fuck, then fight me

I move with the elegance of an African elephant
I presented the evidence, eloquent as the President
Evident, it's with emphasis, I deserve me a championship
But before I banana clip, I'ma chill so my man can rip
Little man against Hellion with the heart of a orphan
I got the words of a murderer and a eye for distortion
You take a slice of my portion, I'll take a piece of your profit
I drive at illegal speeds and keep an OZ in my pocket
We run the jewels in your town, a quarter pound on my person
I'm known for pounding the stage, I'm talking burning and cursing
Producer gave me a beat, said it's the beat of the year
I said ""El-P didn't do it, so get the fuck outta here!""
You wanna hang? Bring your throat, I got stools and a rope
I'm a slang pope, haranguing the land with a man's flow
A new addition to the art of the old code
That's fully retarded and put a part in your bold dome (Ay, El)
Ay, we the villains, we antagonist bad guys
Mercy me, merciless me putting pain in they sad eyes
It's time for Skywalker talkers meet the true Darth Vader
I hit your mom in '03, but a G ain't ate her
So baby boy, you should tighten up and show some respect
Before I Melvin on you, Jody, put my arm on your neck
Or worse yet, be the reason your girl want a divorce
Be at her crib with your kids saying ""Fuck your fort, lil' nigga!""

'Nough of your bummy shit, it's numb to the core, sure
You suck a good dick for the fame and couldn't resist getting played
I fuck like I'm headed to war, I'm really not playing no games
But tag me, goddamn it, I'll kill the carrier mentions my name
Hey, I'm a soldier of fortune, a mercenary on beat
I'm merciless, I'll torture MCs, tie up both of they feet
If they refuse to run the jewels, we beat the bottoms of feet
I'm talking grip pliers, guys, to the top of your teeth
Hey, me and Jaime killed the competition, top of the heap
Is where we stayin' when they corpses resting under our feet
I sent they mom a little cash and a sympathy letter
Told her she raised a bunch o' fuckboys, next time do better, bitch (Run The Jewels)

We the old Atlanta, new Atlanta; future of the city
Daddy Fat Saxx don't give a damn
'Cause can't nan' new nigga get with me
Now it's true, niggas are simply simple-minded, simple Simons
Being dumbed down by the local radio stations by designin'
But what I be rhyming? No payola is required
My bank account obese as fuck while yours sits on a diet
Nigga, your lease is up, you're fired; quiet, that's how the boss talk
Retain ownership on everything, every car bought
And paid for, no neighbors 'cause I'm sitting on acres
Went to Vegas, jumped the broom
'Cause I wasn't trippin' on papers
Or no prenuptual agreement for mama
If we broke up and she took half, I'd still be sitting on commas

How long before the hate that we hold
Lead us to another Holocaust?
Are we so deep in it that we can't end it?
Stop, hold, ever call it off
It's too clear, nuclear's too near
And the holders of the molotov
Say that ""Revolution's right here, right now""
And they ain't callin' off

Wake up, roll an eighth up
Throw a double finger with a fist
Here at the abyss
I will be your tour guide
It is war time, check your wrists (Ready, kids?)
Over to your right, shine a light
Got a bevy ready for the fight
I just wanna live, I don't wanna ever have to load a clip
Only hunt bliss
I am still a kid in my heart
But these motherfuckers sick
They don't give a shit, not at all
They don't even want to let you take a little piss in a pot
Listen along
They don't want your love, shit is bugged
Motherfuckers steady getting rich from the blood
Love when you beg
Trust, I would sooner put a puckered pair of lips to the sun
You might also likeLove will survive
Run out under iridescent lights for our lives
I will be surprised if we ever got the feeling so alive as tonight
Wild for the night
Look into my eyes
I am standing at your side for the fight
Minds over might
Swear to God
They could barely even see the dog
They don't see the size of the fight

Wake up
Drink water
Smoke blunt
Clean, oil my Kalashnikov
Stockpile ten for me and friends in case shit get to poppin' off
The evening news givin' yous views
Telling you to pick your master for president
Been behind the curtain, seen the devil workin'
Came back with some evidence
I'm here to tell you don't let 'em tell you what's right wrong
Make love, smoke kush, try to laugh hard and live long
That's the antidote
You defeat the devil when you hold onto hope
'Cause kinfolk life is beautiful
And we ain't gotta die for them other men
And I refuse to kill another human being
In the name of a government
'Cause I don't study war no more
I don't hate the poor no more
Gettin' more ain't what's more
Only thing more is the love
So when you see me
Please greet me with a heart full
And a pound and a hug

Save my swollen heart
Bring me home from the dark
Take me up, take me up, take me up
Take me up, take me up, take me up

Up, up, up
Up, up
Up, up, up, up, up, up

Seen the devil give a sermon in the church
Seen an angel dancing in the club
Tryin' to feed a baby so I threw a thousand in the air
And blessed her with a hug
I done been down so many times
Walked on, like a dirty rug
And now that I made it, can't fake it
Gotta give me what I'm truly worthy of
(Worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy, worthy)
And I don't know how much it really means to be right
(Means to be right, means to be right)
And what a joy it'd be to see some peace in this life
(Peace in this life, peace in this life)
And it occurs to me that maybe we ain't even really seein' it right
Here in the dark
Hoping just to see a beam of the light

Really fell out the lane with this shit
Man, print this shit: I'm a misfit
Got a style from the guts of the most irrational beast in the district
Born to the next-gen system
Slow water drip to the temple to live in a prison
When the walls don't appear to your vision
One floor down from that mall's that prison
Where shower stalls'll get all y'all missin'
Pardon me, I got half-wit vision
But fuck I know? I just crawled here, cap'n
Pass me the baton, the rest o' ya'll batten the hatches
In fact, better scram, I'm a bastard
On the lam in a hatchback blasting some rap shit
Trying not to slam into traffic
With my feet on the wheel and my hands
Through the moonroof laughing, let's crash this
See, the truth from the womb is a fool-proof plan
To be doomed while the damned do they dances
So I move through the room like an animal fooling a master
But I don't got love for the hand with the food
Matter fact, I am drooling at that shit
I don't only bite, but I'm rabid
Try to pet my fucking head again
And I'mma put a tooth through the flesh
Of the palm that you jack with
This city just screams black magic
And the threat to my heart got traction
Maybe should've never started this path
Every time I get a chance to advance, it's backwards
No thanks to my very own actions
Get a couple good drinks in the kid
I can flip on a friend, take a drug, fuck a chick that I shouldn't
Oh god, I am one of those mad men

Trying not to walk crooked while this anchor's dropped
But I been out on them choppy waves and it's hard to say
Where this land begins and that water stops
I got sea legs
I got sea legs

Real shit, I came for the jewels
I'm the killer of kings and fools
I'm the reason the season for treason starts this evening
And this evening, the odds ain't even
People praying to the gods but the gods ain't even listening
Don't matter if you're Muslim, Hebrew, Christian
When death runs in the distance
There will be no 'mercy me's
There will be no reprieve for the thieves
There will be no respect for The Thrones
No master mastered these bones
Your idols all are my rivals, I rival all of your idols
I stand on towers like Eiffel, I rifle down all your idols
Niggas will perish in Paris, niggas is nothing but parrots
I write for the writers that write for the liars
That impress you and your parents
Is this real or another dimension?
Am I trippin' here in the kitchen?
Am I a victim of my convictions?
I feel my sanity slippin'
And I think I like the freedom
Cannibal, animal, rappers I eat 'em
Even in Dubai, I smoke like it's legal
Bitch so exotic, she rode on a zebra
Made in America, home of the eagle
Home of the anger, home of the evil
Do what I do for the good of my people
Holding my lane, smoke jane in a Regal
Trying not to walk crooked while this anchor's dropped
But I been out on them choppy waves and it's hard to say

It be feelin' like the life that I’m livin' man I don't control
Like every day I’m in a fight for my soul
Could it be that my medicine’s the evidence
For pigs to stop and frisk me when they rollin' round on patrol?
And ask “Why you’re here?”
I just tell 'em cause it is what it is
I live here and that’s what it is
He chimed “You got a dime?
I said “Man, I’m tryin' to smoke and chill
Please don’t lock me up in front of my kids
And in front of my wife
Man, I ain’t got a gun or a knife
You do this and you ruin my life
And I apologize if it seems like I got out of line, sir
'cause I respect the badge and the gun
And I pray today ain't the day that you drag me away
Right in front of my beautiful son”
And he still put my hands in cuffs, put me in the truck
When my woman screamed, said “Shut up”
Witness with the camera phone on
Saw the copper pull a gun and
Put it on my gorgeous queen
As I peered out the window
I could see my other kinfolk
And hear my little boy as he screamed
As he ran toward the copper begged him not to hurt his momma
'cause he had her face down on the ground
And I’d be much too weak to ever speak what I seen
But my life changed with that sound

You want cash or hope, no clash, matter fact get both
Go without get turnt to ghosts
You know that's the law, deal done by the shake of claws
It ain't a game if the shit don’t pause
And I find you odd, so convinced in the truth of y’all
That the true truth’s truly gone
And yes there's a they, any time a man say there's not
Then you know that he lost the plot, what can I say?
Truth’s truth when denied or not, like its true crews ride the cock
Fair enough, the way that the beat bump do sound tough
I made it in the dark like Civil War surgery
Woke up in the same air you huff, early
By twelve o’clock the whole Earth felt dirty
Street Lamps stare when you walk watch the birdie
They’ll watch you walk to the store they’re recording
But didn’t record cop when he shot, no warning
Heard it go pop, might have been two blocks
Heard a kid plus pops watched cop make girl bleed

Told the dawgs I'd bring it back, it was a seal of faith
Before no car notes, baby girl, she played the tourist guide
Got the keys into my city, now she know the rides
Got new money, got new problems, got new enemies
When you make it to the top, that's the amenities
Packin' out Toyota like I'm in the league
And it ain't a mosh pit if ain't no injuries
I got 'em stage divin' out the nosebleeds (Alright, alright, alright)
And she hit that booger sugar 'til her nose bleed (Alright, alright, alright)
Bounce that shit forever, she on both knees
She was talkin' 'bout forever, got a whole week (Alright, alright, alright)

She keep my dick jumpin' up, feel like I'm Moby

This is the real action: the pot party, the trippers, the grasshoppers, the hip ones
All gathered in secrecy and flying high as a kite

Hmm-hmm
Just know what this about
Hmm-hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm
Palm trees, oceans, fresh air, that can break your heart

Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hm
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's not who you are)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God)
Hmm-hmm (That's just not your job)
Hmm-hmm (Stop tryna be God, God)

Ride for it every night
Visions and these angles tight
Truth be told, I never try
Diamonds are the wife of life
All three Rollies look alike (Hm)
After two you get a hook-up price
Stripper never worked a nine-to-five (Hm)
Delta and I ship it overnight (Hm)
Stop tryna be God Almighty (Hm)
Fuck the money, never leave your people behind, yeah
It's never love, no matter what you try
Still can see it comin' down your eyes
'Cause they did not create commandments (Ooh-ooh)
When you hustle, always make it fancy (Ooh-ooh)
The signal's far from what you can be (Ooh-ooh)

Stop tryna play God Almighty
Always keep your circle tight
I been wantin' shit my whole life
I'm warning you, better not try to play God tonight
If I love her, I'ma pass on her
First rule of war, you find an act on her
You can't win a trophy or a plaque off her
But never turn your back on her
'Cause they did not create commandments
When you hustle, always make it fancy
The signal's far from what you can be
'Cause air traffic controls the landing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You won't succeed tryna learn me
Stick to the roads in my journey
Stay out of court when you got the attorney
She say she love, but want to really burn me

Is it the complex of the saint
That's keepin' you so, so, so still still?
Is it a coat of old paint
That's peelin' every day against our will?
Is it too long since the last
Open conversation you had? Oh, no
And did you see the void in the past?
And can you ever see it comin' back?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?
Well, can you always be a step ahead of it for me?

Don't talk to the boy 'bout comparisons, shit
Or come to the boy on some arrogant shit
The weapons we got are some terrorist shit

I told her I don't got no cash and she said she could wait on a rack, on some Arabic shit
I pull out a million and stare at the shit

Man, fuck all that spinnin' the narrative shit

And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? (Cool)
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em

Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you, I've been looking
Stop the waiting 'fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
""You don't understand me""—what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah, it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar-honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Ugh!

20/20, 20/20 vision
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, eye
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
So...
Can I get a kiss? (Can I get a kiss?)
And can you make it last forever? (Make it last forever)
I said I'm 'bout to go to war ('Bout to go to war)
I don't know if I'ma see you again (See you again)
Can I get a kiss? (Can I?)
And can you make it last forever? (Can you?)

Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window

I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are

Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand (Ayy)
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone (Gone, nigga)
New magic (Woo), new magic, new magic wand

My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine

Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)
(Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone)
Please don't leave me now (I can make her leave)

Please don't leave me now (Don't leave)

Please don't leave me now

I wanna be found, passenger in your car (Don't leave)
You wanna be mean, mixed signals don't park (I can make her leave)
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand (Don't leave)
We can finally be together

You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck? You not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one? Evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
(Run, run, run, run)
I'll pick you both
(Run, run, run, run)
It's not a joke, murder she wrote

Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, but the walkin' depends
If you can’t understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
And let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't—
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned

I never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good

I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled

You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house

Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled

And Salem, my love (I know)

(You're the best around)
See I get jealous (Fuck)
And if I see that nigga (If I see him)
I just might kill him, haha (Look)

A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na

A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now, she tryna patch me up, but

If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude

Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See, when I'm with my friends, I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time

Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine

Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...

I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Forreal, you need to go somewhere, like, get some bitches or something
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck

They say the loudest in the room is weak
That's what they assume, but I disagree

Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely (Woo)

Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony (Woo)

Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago

You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh (Hahaha)
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars (Skrrt)
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed

Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy (Ohh, woo)

My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes (Nah)
Like a vasectomy, what have I done? (Ohh)
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone (Who)
Mirror, mirror on the wall (Who)
The loneliest of them all (Me)

Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet

You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it

Satan's gettin' jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferrin' us
Books on not givin' a fuck is what they're referring us (Wolf Gang)
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us (Bitch)
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead, I rap about fucking bitches and gettin' heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby (Ah)
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhymin' pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox

Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours (Umbrella)

Got a nigga shakin' like the calmest, fucking Haitian (Ha-ha)

I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick (Hate dick)
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She runnin' 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose (On God)
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops

Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome (La, la)
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressin' pourin' out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler, The Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands (Bitch)
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's tryin' to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleadin' squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex Mix, she bleedin' from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirrin' ruckus, throwin' sets up, yeah (Wolf Gang)
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin (I hate you)
Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossin' the border (Arriba)
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
'Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Angel's daughter (Fuck Mary)
I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starvin' Nigerian kids barfing (Blegh)
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playin' leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, ""Yeah Bob, this nigga's sick""
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead (Skinhead) since India Arie (India Arie)
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said ""Fuck coke"" and now I'm snortin' Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket (Casket)
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out ""Fuck faggots""
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic

Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing

Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five

In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, ""Fuck shit""
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, ""Hi,"" I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
""Analog"" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the ""Tron Cat"" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch

This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible (Why don't you jump, you fucking pussy?)
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit (Fucking faggot)
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick (I'll show you)
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts (Pistol, I got one!)
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs

Tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale!

They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Um
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, bend my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
She thinks you're getting cash, no, bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait, turn this up, bitch, this my jam (Where the drums at?)
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig​ger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned
(I'm just fucking around)

Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty?
Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on

Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing (Uh)
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a Bimmer, E46
Have you heard ""48""? Motherfucker, I'm great (Yeah)
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do, I go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like (Fuck that disease, bitch!)
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down, I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare
On the same damn bus like, ""You're going to jail now""
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty?
Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone

How much wood could a woodchuck chuck
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck? Bitch, suck dick
Motherfuck' you and your opinions
(Can you kick it?) Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I'm a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I'm badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!

How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well, if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me
Tryna set mood, little RedTube, fuck lotion
I don't need lube, dry fist suits me (Yeah)
Up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound
The shit's kind of disgusting, fap time
And before I flatline, Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like—

Oh, shit, aw, fuck

Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-

This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go 'head and fucking eat
My father's dead, well, I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano 'cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga, I'm Satan's son

My mother raised me, a single parent, so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important, I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves

Simple, but probably not, fuck em

I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls: the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot, like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
'Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this

I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like ""Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?""
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school

Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made ""Sarah"" to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
""Fuck me,"" the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church

I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died (I'm so sorry) No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys

I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating

My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail

Wow, umm

Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it (Fuck, I can't sing, whatever, look)
We met through mutual friends (Mutual friends)
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana, but I had to pretend that I wasn't
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, ""I don't know""? (I don't know)
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, because

'Cause, girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young (For me, uh)
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (No)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)

A six-year Difference, uh
Is a ten year Sentence
And with the pigment on my skin
I don't want to be another Statistic
You bring me joy, joy, joy, joy
And you fill a void that was once missing
And I can say I'm in love

And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up (Woo!)
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God, yo)

When you're thirty-five, I'll be forty-one
And when I'm twenty-seven, you'll be twenty-one, yo, this is dumb
And when that time comes for that 1-8, I'll probably run
'Cause I'm fucking terrified, yo, this is dumb, you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally, you're older than me, and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention ""hang"", I'm thinking 'bout a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds, um
But I found my wings, fuck
But you're too fucking young
I really like you
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
I don't know what to do
And, girl, you stole my heart, but you're too fucking young
Funny thing about this is, by the time you hear this
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love (Oh my God)
It won't even matter, I'll be in the clear, haha
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young, ha

Boy, I know that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy, I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared (I know)

I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I'll exit and wait a while
Just say the word, girl
Can't you see the answers are all there?
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you, girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all, baby, it's just you and me
But you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin’ hurts
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young

For your boy
I'm watching Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
Nigga

Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me, nigga, you not important
I'm focused (Two, three, four)
Bring in the horns

They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkins a faggot, please come and get me (Two, three, four)
Said I suckin' at your neck, like a hickey, boy, I'm sicky (Two, three, four)
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me a demon (Yeah)
And a terrorist? Goddamn it, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber (Two, three, four)
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nig​ger
I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat (Man...)
Cherry Bomb the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound (Two, three, four)
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, 'bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust (Woo)
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beast is loose (Two, three, four)
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes (Why, oh, why don't they like me? They don't like me, oh)
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more Section 8
And what we ate was the steaks, now our section is great (Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, don't they like me?)
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my nigga, pass 'em a plate
'Ye!

Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me? (Two, three, four)
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks (Two, three, four)
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas (Two, three, four)
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin' (Two, three, four)
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' (Yeah)
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me (Two, three, four)
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em (Two, three, four)
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me ""Are you still down?"" (Two, three, four)
Yeah, my nigga, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on (Two, three, four)
I know they told they white daughters, ""Don't bring home Jerome""
I am the free nigga archetype (Woo)
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon (Ask the deacon)
It's funny, when you get extra money (Two, three, four)
Every joke you tell just be extra funny (Yeah, yeah)
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny (Two, three, four)
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me (Woo) (Two, three, four)
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (Skrrt!)
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level (Two, three, four)
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God (Two, three, four)
He said, ""I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"", uh (Woo)
For your boy
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room
Damn (Two, three, four)

Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction
Been exhausted, I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers
Hold your fuckin' ponies, my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely, I eat pussy like Shoney's, yeah
It's Tunechi, homie, Master of Ceremonies
I knock 'em down, Domino effect, no pepperoni, I swear
It's them Golf boys, like them Hot Boys (Yeah)
For the nine-nine and two-thousand, but it's the two-thou' and (Yeah)
The one-four and the one-five, yo, what up, Wayne?
What up, Slime? Nigga, go hard
Yeah, I'ma go hard like before came
Got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad, and she give brain
That's that road head (Yeah), that's a dream car
Got a full tank of that same year I was born
That's that one-nine-nine-one, 'nother nigga like I, you won't find one
'Cause, nigga, I'm a god, a divine one; Tune! (Two, three, four)
My trigger finger wise, but my .9 dumb (Yeah)
Middle finger blind, so it's fuck A-N-Y-one (Um)
Fuck, skate, and die son, a hundred ways to die, son
I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rollie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda, oh my goodness
Wayne, them bitches ugly, these niggas colder than Tommy buddy
Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel (Black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling (Two, three, four)
Boy, let's get a scrimmage and cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German, you bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow and get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was
Fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot, ugh! Son, you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus (That's too harsh)
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchini
I know, it ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange, nah, faggot, it's Golf Wang386Embed",https://images.genius.com/4e9f66f62fdc9420b7b69482ae69c248.400x400x1.jpg

But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch

Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down

Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats

How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)
How many lawyers you got? (A lot)

Break it on down, I break it on down
I break it on down, I break it on down
Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left, I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand-up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
Question
How many faking they streams? (A lot)
Getting they plays from machines? (A lot)
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem (Hmm)
I never say anything (Nah), everybody got they thing (True)
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes (Hmm)
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it ""a lot,"" I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gon' pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
How much money you got? (A lot)
How many problems you got? (A lot)
How many people done doubted you? (A lot)
Left you out to rot? (A lot)
How many pray that you flop? (A lot)

Can't leave without it (I can't leave without it)
I keep a stick for the war (Stick)
Checks I deposit (Checks I deposit)
Money just stick with the boy

Lot of model bitches check for me
Nigga, don’t check for me 'less you got checks for me
I kept a stick like a hobo, no checkin' me
Way back when D-Lo had the spot in Trestletree
So many hoes, had to get a vasectomy
She left her body home and brought her neck to me
I did a walk-through, they sent a jet to me
Y'all niggas show price less than my travel fee
One of my arms worth a ticket
Watch so much that a car came with it
Back in the day I used to rob with no mask on
Shit on my wrist, I woulda killed the whole house for
And I went to school high, I ain't go to class though
I was with the OGs learnin' 'bout the glass bowl
Caught me with a deuce five, mama kicked my ass, bro
Break yourself, leave his brains on the dashboard
I'm with Ced and Lil Baby (Yeah)
We got four choppers that’s full (21)
Way before rappin’, on God, I was trappin', sneakin’ my Glock in Lacura (On God)
I got my K from Osama Bin Laden, lil' nigga, he signed this shit (Straight up)
I'm 4L gang, if you reach for my chain, then a nigga gon' die in this bitch (On God)

Runnin' this shit, what the fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Skinny jeans stuffed with them hundreds, they poke out
S65, I'm in a robot
I'm a real one, ain't running from nobody

Ain't sparin' no bitch, give a fuck 'bout a blowout
If we wanna smoke with you, boy, you can't go out
Still gettin' money my label don't know 'bout
Court-side with the vibe with her toes out
Rich nigga, I come straight out the poor house
Trap goin' crazy right there by Morehouse
Dead end, me, Ced and more ahks
Bought a Benz, doubled back, bought a trap house

I lost all my friends countin' bands and I copped a Benz
Pulled up with no army, just the guap and I'm spendin' it
No, no, never lendin' it, that's all for me
I stay greedy with the dollar, givin' no 'pologies
All these mans with they fuckin' hands out, tryna spare some
I don't never stress, no, I got plenty peso
I been all alone, on my own in my new mansion
Everybody says I went ghost, jump in my Phantom
Paparazzi always tryna press up on me
Ever since I blew up, I don't know nobody (Know nobody)
Yeah, I blew 80 bands only for you to leave
Hey, I know somewhere that my mama prayin' for me (For me)

I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe (For me)
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth (For me)
If she wanna dance, let her dance for the money, ooh
I don't need no friends if you really wanna know the truth
I lost all my friends countin' bands in the Bentley coupe
Diamonds on me doin' handstands, Rosé on my tooth

Grind hard, nigga, grind hard, I done grind hard
Late nights playin' b-ball with a decoy
I was on the corner with the robbers and the d-boys
Now I'm on the charts, man, this shit is unbelievable
Mama, it's a lot of secrets that I had to keep from you
Got in so much trouble, thought the teachers had beef with you
And it paid off 'cause we livin' like the Greeks and Jews
Used to leave your stove runnin', stove runnin' (21, 21)
Now it's Louis rags when my nose runnin'
Got it out the mud, I don't owe nothin'
You pussy ass niggas, I ain’t on nothin'
Wanna see me fucked up 'cause they poor hustlin'
The same niggas with me back when I was head itchin'
Man I'm having nightmares that the feds listenin'
You fake gangstas pump fakin' and they scared snitchin'
The coupe fast and it's fucking up the dash digits

Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money

It's a bag on his head, I'ma pick it up
It was money in the house, I used to stick it up
Got your main bitch chillin', splashin', tryna lick it up
Dick ridin', niggas always tryna flick it up
I ain't tryna take no pictures, bitch I'm rollin' Swishers
I count my back end then I jump out with that pistol
If you ain't suckin' dick you get a early dismissal
We got your wifey at the spot, she tryna lick a pickle
I just went and bought a Lamb and it cost a nickel
And I came from the bottom and it feel good
And I went platinum, still in the hood
And I take the gang with me everywhere I go
Why these niggas hatin' on me? Man I don't know
Ain't a place in the world that I can't go
And I got a hundred racks inside a Go-Go
And I get a hundred racks for a show, show
Wanna give a bitch my heart but I can't though
I can't fall in love with a stank ho
Lil' bitch I fell in love with the bank ho
And you know I love that good drank, ho

And I put it in her stomach and I made that lil' bitch ride me
You're my old school runner, you're my old school runner
But my new school runnin', it costs more than a hundred
You lil' niggas so bummy (21)
Make a diss song, they gon' wrap you like a mummy
My young niggas geekin' on boot like zombies
They hungry, up it on you then they tell you, ""Run it""
I stole cars, drove them like go-karts (facts)
Niggas actin' like bitches, they got both parts (cat)
And I came from the gutter, I don't got no heart
And I'm straight up out the gutter, I don't got no heart
Nigga when they killed my brother, I had to go hard
Put that chopper in his face and then I Bogart
Niggas tryna cross me, I don't understand it
I'm just tryna take care of the family
And I'm sippin' Codeine, not Brandy (21)
And I'm sippin' Codeine, I'm an addict
You go to jail, can't depend on a bad bitch
She fucked and sucked him tryna keep up with the fashion
And I'm really, really rich and I ain't braggin'
Sometimes I really can't believe this shit happened
Who woulda thought I'd make it rappin'?
I almost lost my life when I was trappin'
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the money
Numb the pain with the money, numb the pain with the

(Zaytoven)
(Metro Boomin want some more, nigga)

Rags to riches, nigga came from the bottom
Hood rats, now a nigga fuckin' on models
Ridin' in the foreign, remember ridin' on MARTA
Grind got harder and my mind got smarter
I was gettin' bags for the cheap
When I ain't had money, I was robbin', nigga
I was gettin' bags for the free
21 Gang, they were right beside me
And they still with me, nigga, I'm on TV
Couple niggas switched up, bitched up, fuck 'em
I can't go nowhere without a pistol or a rubber
I'm too, too player to put a bitch before my brother
I'm too street smart, nigga, to serve a undercover
Niggas tryna clone a nigga's shit, damn, woah
Used to drive a hotbox, shit, Lambo'
Niggas want a handout, shit, mine broke
I grinded for this shit, I grinded for this shit
Can't change on my gang, niggas still here
Kinda hard to change my ways 'cause the shit real
Niggas rappin' 'bout shit they ain't even lived
Niggas lyin', I can hear it in their ad-libs
I'm poppin' Percocets, bitch, not Advil
It's kinda fucked up what they did to Black, damn
If I catch him in the trap, I'ma whack him
I catch that boy in traffic, nigga, I'ma whack him
Nigga, try to keep up with this fashion, uh
Makin' sure my kids happy, yeah
They dependent on their daddy, yeah
Tryin' not to let the streets distract me
I know it's bumps in the road like acne
Had to sell dope, I couldn't be an athlete
I'm a solid young nigga, you can ask C
The internet ain't gon' help you, understand me

I'm a street nigga, yeah, I'm famous
I'm a rapper, nigga, and I'm gang-bangin'
Everybody kill a nigga, what you claimin'?
Everybody get it with your nigga flamin'
All these chains on a nigga like I'm stranglin'
Ran off with your money, nigga, guess we straight then
You knockoff gang-bangers ain't bangin'
In the hood everyday, I'm hangin'

And I come through when the gang need
And I wear shades, so they can't see
And I pay them lawyers and the bond fees
Nigga, one thousand, I'm beyond G
I put my main bitch inside Givenchy
Niggas still askin', ""Can you front me?""
My old ho sayin', ""Boy, you growed up""
Promethazine, it got a nigga slowed up
Too solid, pussy-niggas can't disclose us
Went and seen Eliantte, and he froze us
I'm too street to walk around with my nose up
Especially to the niggas knew me 'fore I blowed up
Savage Mode drop, now my price'll go up
Streets cold, nigga, they ain't showin' no love
Niggas get in front of judge and they fold up
Face shot, hit that boy with the whole dub
I'm a street nigga, yeah, I'm famous

I think Mengistu Haile Mariam is my neighbor
Whoever it is moved in and put an automated gate up
Repainted brick walls atop which now cameras rotated
By eight, the place dark, one light burn later
Razor wire like a slinky
Rumor is parcel bomb took the secretary right eye and pinky
Evenings, he take a snifter of whisky on the veranda
I wonder what he's thinking
In the morning, the maid brings coffee from the kitchen
Some nights strange music plays, I lay in bed and listen
Downstairs I hear my mother breaking dishes, my father trippin'
It's been quite bad lately, high tension
Galvanized steel security fencin'
To get through the day, give myself a mission
Anything what get me out the house a blessin'
His bodyguard chews khat, spits black in the rhododendron
Blacked out Range rumble when he start the engine
Avocado tree hang over the property line

I must confess kabiyesi, this detention seems to look well on you
But, so does captivity look well on a lamb we are fattening up for the feast. Or, perhaps as you say, on a wife we treat with special favor because she is going to bear us a child.

Black astronaut, cop a space suit and jet off my steps
Challenger launch burnin' bright, burn to death
Burn in the firmament, charbroiled, catch the hair
Black boy burned crisp, pursed black lips
Black marionettes dance limp over the pit
The kindly ones distant as the winter's sun
A mad woman whistlin', you can hear it if you listen
That's that empty pipe hissin', that's him crying and twitchin'
That's the vanishing point in the distance
Between us just the glass thickness
Cracked mirrors flash rictus
Skin pulled tight to the skull, that's the sickness
Seepin' through my leaky windows and broke fixtures

Nah man, you can't smoke that here (Gotta go, man. You gotta go)

Burnt offering in the desert
Shining city up on the hill, I burned it like Nebuchadnezzar
This world, hard to even take its measure
Three rooms filled with Incan treasure
Still strangled the king 'cause it's now or never
It's a freedom in admitting it's not gonna get better
Washing your hands of people you known forever
I'd be a liar if I feign surprise, a goat eats where it's tethered
Treat African proverbs like Vegas flyers, I float above the peasants
Too clever by half, halftime down twenty
I'm not that good at math, but common sense, I got plenty
(It's fuckin' over)
In person, these rappers' watches look temptin'
The chain say envy, but PTSD keep me countin', never spendin'
My accountant is a head full of bad memories and sad endings
It's all payment pending
I'm not concerned with generational wealth, that's its own curse
Anything you want on this cursed Earth
Probably better off gettin' it yourself, see what it's worth

The photograph of young Tutankhamun
Spaghetti links tangled like ramen
Everything behind the mask rotten
I tell people I keep it so you not forgotten, but that's cap
I thought pillars of salt, but she too smart for lookin' back
Mid-eighties in the rear-view of a gold Mercedes
Midday sun make the crocodiles lazy
Money phone pocket dial, run come save me
Sweet old ladies poisoning pigeons in the park
For a lark, make mine strychnine, life is a zipline in the dark
Spare me the Hallmark Karl Marx
I was in the Dollar Tree break-room playin' cards with quarters
Stop loss posters on the wall, brick and mortar
I watched the planet from orbit, remorseless

Real observant in split-second decisions
Quick to kill a merchant (brr)
Child of God, might stray away at times, though I'm still a servant (Blockworks)
In the hood with the hoodlums where the killers purgin'
Niggas workin' with the Agency, makin' me really nervous
In the hills so far, can't even get no service
Out of range, learned the tricks to the trade and all the inner workings (the ins and outs)
Dug down in my soul and did some soul searchin' (yeah)
All I found was a police report for a missin' person (uh)
Every time I pay the connect, make a bigger purchase
Tryna run this bag up, fuck buying them bitches purses (fuck that ho)
Mirror image of the block, I paint a picture perfect
Our father who art in heaven all a nigga worship (our father)
Movin' at a slow pace, I used to get discouraged
All gas, no brakes, never did reverse it (skrrt skrrt)
Freestylin' on that road, never did rehearse it
On the janky promoter's tour through the Chitlin' Circuit
Where we at?
Game time

Dre shot his uncle for beatin' his mom
Beat the case, started eleventh grade like nothin' was wrong
A few classmates made the news, police pursuits
Reg flew off the dirt bike like a carton of eggs
Came back stutterin' with a limp and a dent in his head
Beautiful dreams he said he had when he was dead, twice on the table
On the bright side, they only gave him house arrest once they seen he disabled (good lawyer!)
Some couldn't wait to kick they kids out
Others had to do it 'fore gangs shot up the house
Annie used to lock her little brother in his room and we'd fuck on the couch
Doggie; she didn't like to kiss on the mouth
Switched schools, the rumors was gettin' loud
Men hate women, make up lies and spread 'em around
I grew up on the line 'tween north and south
I-95, two airports, triangular trade routes
E'rything we say mispronounced, flipped and bounced
Use the wrong word on the phone? SIM cards are switchin' out
Superstitious, cut my face out the pictures
Apartment complex a speed bump for the stick-ups
E'rything smooth but the gun just hiccuped
Central American ubermensches in the bed of a pickup

Waves on wharves, war washed the poor
Never broke again, what he said on the farm
Next day they was gone
Back by nightfall, they swung in the maw
Hung by daylight, the day was long
Sweep water out with the dipper
Salt in the mouth of a river
Mangrove thickets, man's soul was broken mirrors
False witness, wolf tickets
Nowadays scavengers come before the wolf's finished
Teeth bare, bristlin', they not scared, somethin' different
The huts was empty, coal still warm in the kitchen
Cannibal tours, they came on all fours
Waterborne, eyes like Jaws
Bones litter the beach, gnawed
Cracked meat out the beast's claws

African Queen on the ships deck
Shipwrecked Europeans swimmin' with the virus
Shot out like God's semen
""Fuck the world"" Pac's screamin'
Crack missions for the heathens
Boats listing from the stealings
Smoke drifting from holes in the ceilings

The future isn't flying cars, it's Rachel Dolezal absolved
It's autonomous computers sendin' shooters back in time at the behest of defunct message boards

In a place called now buyin' flowers and leaves
Black soap, crack, choke under masonic sword
From where they tax hold two thousand dollar reward
Found on the road, dead, pulling cotton from thorns
Scary hour, heretic, kicks canary
Travel Fox, wouldn't step in blood, wouldn't 
Bend the bitch one-eighty, what she asked for

Mogambo, the new world in motion picture entertainment
Mogambo, unforgettable adventure in untamed Africa
Africa, known for centuries as the white man's graveyard
The heat and fury of the jungle tears
The veneer of civilization from these women
No holds are barred as they fall in love with a man who lives for adventure

Facing existential threats, my advice, kill ‘em dead
No regrets, the devil’s rejects writ large
Observe the precepts of a benevolent god
Blue-eyed Prometheans in the heart of darkness.
Land of the monsters. Walk like Quetzalcoatl amongst the conquered
Dick hard
Put myself in the stars, his woman in the dirt
Face down, ass up, doing God’s work
Go native, the world is yours. (It’s mine, it’s mine, it’s mine)
The sound of Maxim's gun still sends a chill up my spine
Empire of the Sun, never sets
A Christian’s duty is never done
You can bet on significant returns to all shareholders
King Solomon's mines, just give me a hundred experienced soldiers
The knowledge of good and evil, sweet nothings whispered by cobras
Useless baubles given to greedy chiefs
Lies told with the practiced ease of an old thief
When they hung the poor nigga, I felt a certain relief

With that holy trinity, who can argue my divinity under two red suns
Return like Kipling’s dead son, summoned by monkey paw
A thousand Philistines slain with a donkey’s jaw
Gave them the rule of law, schools, roads, jobs, clothed and shod
Still, they fled to the land of Nod

Empire fat like a cow, slaughtered for the feast

Crowd you off that jumper, couldn't even hit the net
And they happy to see you back around the way
Eager to front yay, rock
Take a dutch up the block

Game on tilt, working them flippers

Ain't no 'next', you out the picture

Life crawling by the bottom of the screen like a news ticker
At least you tried, right nigga?
Put that syrup in the mixture
Feeling like the vic, every sip helps the shoe fit ya
Everything that glitters, old gold, ice cold, thrice-fold
Catch the Holy Ghost and the Spirit waiting for Christ to call
But it's all business, even God waiting for the price to fall
That's how they do, y'all
That's life, might as well heist the ball

Cold fryer full of old grease
You don't work, you don't eat
The wind didn't blow for a week
Birds fly east searchin' for green
Open beaks in the nest, money machines
Flutterin', flags, covetous hags
It's not really movin' if it's not movin' fast
Mouth full of glass
Mouth full of glass
Water like a mirror, cut the gas with precision scissors
Bent to the task as if gravedigger
When it was slow cut each other's hair with clippers
Bullets cuttin' through dead air lookin' for victims
Vickers, VSM stamped on the ammunition
That's unusual though
Usually you sit there, the sun come and go
The moon float, horses thrown overboard kick fast, then slow
It don't really mattеr which
Thick mist, piff smoke, draw straws from clenched fists
Sinkin' ship, human souls in thе hull
He got the whole world in his hands, ice cold
Open them palms up, turned black as a ghost

Nothin' ever happens 'til it do
Waterproof boots, almost new
Moms shook her head, ""you shouldn't wear a dead man's shoe""
Nothin' ever happens 'til it does

Nothin' ever happens 'til it does
Muchos problemas if you don't have it for the plug

In tight spaces I learned not to speak
Submarine skirtin' mountain peaks
Fernando Po's Black Beach
Yemeni traders off the coast of Mozambique
Packed bodegas, akh in the weeds
Gold shimmerin' in the reef
African water in the lengths of the piece
Tha Carter III pour out a double parked Jeep

At the corner the water waist deep

Money went same as it came
Money spent, it was all pocket change
End of the day, day-traders make minimum wage
Pennies on the dollar once it's all said and paid
Penny stocks, stocking cap pulled over the face
Out of habit, the presidents facing the same way
Somebody made a killing, I just dug the grave
Capital gains, and gains (And gains, and gains)
Skim the indictment for old code names
Little Sambo grinning on a can of pomade
Dueling banjos open the stock exchange
Paper chasing, it hard to stay on thе same page (It is)
""No hard feelings"" the turn of phrasе, Twain adapted for the stage
A lifetime in the game, now the league folding
Contracts voided, Mohamed Atta, fly in the ointment
It's hot on these streets monsieur, I might shoot a Arab
If it's hot on the beach the plug just jet to Paris

One in a million makes a killing off the curb
Nine ninety-nine thousand, nine ninety-nine in the dirt
A sign above my head to count how many patrons served
Every time the number flips somebody get what they deserve
God is watching but I guess he got a lot of cheeks to turn
Ain't no shoulder colder once the fire die from bridges burned
Keep your mind off what is mine or you'll be smilin' on a shirt
It ain't ever over 'cause the fat lady forgot the word
Rain or sleet or famine and disease, I'm in the streets steppin'
With a reason, somebody deceased dangling from each necklace
Stuck inside the belly of the beast, she forty weeks pregnant
Might pull out the hammer, hit your knees and check your reflexes
Feeling like a million bucks - all twenties
And all I got is time and I heard that this shit's money
So you can count on me if you ain't in a big hurry
If you got mouths to feed I'ma make sure they stay hungry
God bless the child that took yours and got away with it
Won't testify if he caught and holla, ""They did it""
Thought all this time that he bought was what he'd take with him
Fiends take the drugs and have dreams with his face in 'em

Swimmin' in palm oil out here

King of all blacks, I eat human hearts
I let things fall apart, motorcars rustin' in the garage
Granadillas wild in the yard, vines climbin' burglar bars
The roof fell in, on God, it's full of stars
I swam in the dark, sun fled, the moon large
Fire leap from Perry's Black Ark
Slash and burn, the past is never far
Reaching with chopped arms, lopped hands, no spare parts
The band played ""Those Were the Days,"" I watched 'em hang
I ate red red in the stadium stands
From crumbling balustrades, I watched 'em dance
Like drill rappers

You have your price
It's rather high
How high?
Gallows high

They grew fat in famine
Our mortarless fortresses lie abandoned
Alien monoliths still standin', pantin'
Super Ape, put a candle in a skull for a lantern
Light a dutch in Haarlem, Amsterdam, steps of a mansion
Speaking Afrikaans, British accent, I want mine from back when
Thebe said the wind get the ashes in the end, bruv
The guerrillas severed every inoculated limb, left 'em with stubs
Ziggurats on the Nile, bought the house and tore it down

Find my way home, white man left a lamp lit

The pistol burnin' on this mystical journey
Sold parallel paradise, postcarded vision souvenir
Missile launchin' redemption
Church faculty sniper bullets close to the king and moshpit Bleeding marksmen
Bloody footprints, ran from crime scene, crooks involved
The carousel ring backwards, exorcism
Possession of the cookie jar

Almighty God, who created heavens and earth, I ask now that every demon power in this building will be broke. Lord, weak, but we're not defeated!

This thing was broke from the jump
No point going back and forth over who did what
My character arc: Rolling Loud to Shakespeare in the Park
You get stabbed, stagger off in the dark
I'm waiting in the wings, understudied every part
I lied 'cause I loved her, I never crossed my heart
Showed my face, but left right when it started to start
A man apart, drink alone, packed bar
A stack'll turn a stan to your man at arms
A little gas, crash dummies flying out the cars

New Years Eve, I snuck in the Clicquot

It's no church in the wild
My uncle told me they can't bury that many bodies
They burned 'em in piles
It was dark, I could see his teeth, it wasn't a smile
Fire in the hearth, fire in tipped bottle
Long slip, sharp hiss, eyes sunk in they hollows
My heart used to sing, crossing the old Goethals
Money for the plug, Megabus apostles looking for the love
You don't gotta open it up, I got wide nostrils
Woolly hair, feet made of brass
Ghost over Teddy Pendergrass if I see the devil moving fast
Send lookin'-ass niggas through the looking glass

All the ministers have Mercedes, or the new Peugeot
That's when you kinda know, it's that kinda show
They the type, hit your blunt, just let the run go
I'd rather come through your front door (like so)
Shorty can't eat no book, what I told Ta-Nehesi Coates
The room was thick with smoke
CD changer had a remote, remote battery low
I laugh, 'cause sadly you think it's a joke

Told my children Western education is forbidden
Might as well sell what's left of your Ritalin
No loose ends, took an acetylene torch to the filaments
Told my children Western education is forbidden

Lines like Aikman in '95, whole team high
Plot twist, told Leon, ""Lett me drive""
Took my sweet time, the scenic route
The leaf, kaffir lime
Hit police with crisp hand signals, then the peace sign
Wood burnin', we don't slice up this type of pie
Gears turnin', certain e'rything I learned in community college was a lie
Called him, the call's comin' from inside
Farenheit was set in '99, but it wasn't fire this time

Spot on 116 must've had the cops in they pocket
Hydro jars, fifty a pop, line out the door
This back when we had the nerve to call brickweed chocolate
Stacy said her sister's boyfriend had the new hot shit
Gave me the plug like a stock tip
I found religion, I'm a prophet
Loved that girl, but knew we wouldn't work like Harden on the Rockets
Clouds cleared, I'm looking at the city like jihadis in a cockpit
Prices so fucking high, I had to do 'em dirty just to make a profit
Splits like Spotify numbers
A whole lotta green, just me and the punter
Down for the team, saying all the right things
But feeling like Harden on the Thunder

We was raised on paraquat, scraped and fought
By the grace of God, everybody else got caught

At the same time, pedaling to school as a child
Under a canopy of jacarandas, it ain't change much
Colorful trees still surround us, L's get touched
Baby-faced, staring out the window of a school bus
Twenty years later, same wistful look but shackled up
Bearded down, momma kissed his forehead good luck
Tears anoint the crown
He lied to her anyway and toasted that night over pounds
Sterling, whispers in whirlwinds
Polaroid pictures, edges curling
At the auction
The contents of one storage space, sight unseen, going once
Sixteen, seventeen, cracking Philly Blunts
Half the smarts, but twice the heart
Look at the picture, eyes had a spark
Sputtering, at the bar mutterin'
Money comes and goes
Broke today, but tomorrow who knows?
Ten years ago she was just some hoe
Five years after that, I'm in love

Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
'Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearin' less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I never seen before

Runnin' out of pages in your passport
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

These days, all I do is
Wonder if you're bendin' over backwards for someone else
Wonder if you're rollin' up a Backwoods for someone else
Doing things I taught you, gettin' nasty for someone else
You don't need no one else
You don't need nobody else, no
Why you never alone?
Why you always touchin' road?
Used to always stay at home
Be a good girl, you was in the zone
Yeah, you should just be yourself
Right now, you're someone else
You used to call me on my cell phone

Oh man, oh man

I learned the game from William Wesley, you can never check me
Back to back for the niggas that didn't get the message
Back to back, like I'm on the cover of Lethal Weapon
Back to back, like I'm Jordan '96, '97
Woah—very important and very pretentious
When I look back, I might be mad that I gave this attention
Yeah, but it's weighin' heavy on my conscience
Yeah, and fuck, you left The Boy no options

You gon' make me step out of my fuckin' frame
You gon' make me buy bottles for Charlamagne
You gon' make me go out of my fuckin' way
I waited four days, nigga, where y'all at?
I drove here in the Wraith, playin' AR-AB
I'm not sure what it was that really made y'all mad
But I guess this is what I gotta do to make y'all rap
I mean woah, can't fool the city, man, they know what's up
Second floor at Tootsies, gettin' shoulder rubs
This for y'all that think that I don't write enough
They just mad 'cause I got the Midas touch
You love her, then you gotta give the world to her
Is that a world tour or your girl's tour?
I know that you gotta be a thug for her
This ain't what she meant when she told you to open up more
Yeah, trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Yeah, you gettin' bodied by a singin' nigga
I'm not the type of nigga that'll type to niggas

Walked in, ""Ill nigga alert! Ill nigga alert!""

And my latest shit is like a greatest hits
Goddamn, ain't no wishing over on this side
Y'all don't fuck with us, then we don't fuck with y'all
It's no different over on this side
Goddamn, should I listen to everybody or myself?
'Cause myself just told myself:
""You're the motherfucking man, you don't need no help""

And to them hoes I'm everything—everything but gentle
But I still take my time (Time)
Man, I guess I'm just old fashioned
Wearing retro sh—, that's old fashion
Nigga, see what I'm saying, no closed caption
I paint pics, see the shit, good sex, need to hit
Keep a broad on the floor year 'round like season tickets
I plead the fifth, drink a fifth, load the nine
Leave you split, in the half, smoke a half, need a zip
My new girl is on Glee and shit
Probably making more money than me and shit
I swear to God I got 99 problems but a bitch ain't one
I got 99 problems, getting rich ain't one
Like I got trust issues
I'm sorry for the people I've pushed out
I'm the type to have a bullet-proof condom
And still gotta pull out
But that's just me and I ain't perfect
I ain't a saint but I am worth it

What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that
'Cause

I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl, that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown-ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the seventies on your own
My mother is sixty-six and her favorite line to hit me with is
""Who the fuck wants to be seventy and alone?""
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy, was she wrong
That was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't?
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl, I felt like we had it all planned out
I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give, but you cannot take love

Fuck bein' on some chill shit

And I don't feel that shit, not even a little bit
Oh, Lord, know yourself, know your worth, nigga
My actions been louder than my words, nigga
How you so high, but still so down to Earth, nigga?
Niggas wanna do it, we can do it on they turf, nigga
Oh, Lord, I'm the rookie and the vet
Shoutout to the bitches out here holdin' down the set
All up in my phone, lookin' at pictures from the other night
She gon' be upset if she keep scrollin' to the left, dawg
She gon' see some shit that she don't wanna see
She ain't ready for it; if I ain't the greatest, then I'm headed for it
Yeah, that mean I'm way up (Way up)
Yeah, the 6 ain't friendly, but that's where I lay up (Lay up)
This shit a mothafuckin' lay-up

Been cookin' with the sauce, Chef Curry with the pot, boy

Ayy, who the fuck them niggas is, boy?
OVO, man, we really with the shits, boy
Yeah, really with the shits, I should prolly sign to Hit-Boy 'cause I got all the hits, boy (Ha-ha)
Fuck all that ""Drake, you gotta chill"" shit
I be on my Lil Mouse drill shit
Fuck all that rap-to-pay-your-bills shit
Yeah, I'm on some Raptors-pay-my-bills shit
All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger
I got 40 in the studio, every night, late night
Gotta watch that shit, don't want to make him sicker, that's my nigga
Oh, Lord, got a whole lot to show for it
I mean, we could really get it, we could go for it
I'm just here for the bucks and the billis, nigga
Don't make me kill one of the GOATs for it (Arf!)
I run this shit, they like, ""Go Forrest
Run Forrest, run Forrest, go Forrest""
Yeah, I mean you already wrote for us
Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us?
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this?
They ain't made me what I am, they just found me like this
I was ready... fuck that, I been ready
Since my dad used to tell me he was comin' to the house to get me
He ain't show up

The other night Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to
She said they love me unconditional
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg
Damn, okay, from that perspective
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant, they ain't movin' at all
But when they need a favor, who do they call?
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems askin' what was said and who was involved
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough, I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
'Cause if I run the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'
No pun intended, but they smellin' defeat in the air
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?
They tell him that he talkin' crazy but he doesn't care
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'
We already got spring 2015 poppin'
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Good God Almighty—like back in the old days
You know, years ago they had the A&R men to tell you what to play, how to play it and you know, whether it's disco and rock
But, uh, we just went in the studio and we did it
We had the champagne in the studio, of course
You know, compliments of the company
And we just laid back and did it
So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you
Because we had a ball
Only real music is gonna last
All that other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow

Cash rules everything around me, frikki-frikki-frik
C.R.E.A.M.; get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the money, dollar-dollar
D-d-d-d-dollar-dollar, dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)
Cash rules everything around me, C.R.E.A.M
Get the-get the-get the-get the-get the
Get the-get the-get the-get the mon-mon-money
Frikki-frikki-frikki, dollar-dollar-dollar bill, y'all (Y'all, y'all)

Yeah
Uh, after hours at Il Mulino
Or Sotto Sotto, just talkin' women and vino
The contract like '91 Dan Marino
I swear this guy Michael Rapino's boosting my ego
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now
Debates growin' 'bout who they think is the best now
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now
I hear you talking, say it twice so I know you meant it
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants
Or work with their parents
But thinkin' back on how they treated me
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance
Make everybody have to go through security clearance
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn
With the ink I could murder, word to my nigga Irv
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin', dog

Uh, I had Benzes 'fore you had braces
The all-black Maybach, but I'm not a racist
Inside's whiter than Katy Perry's face is
Yellow diamonds in my Jesús
I just might learn to speak Mandarin
Japanese for the yen that I'm handlin'
International Hov, that's my handle
My saint's Changó, light a candle
El Gran Santo on the mantle
Case y'all didn't know, I speak Spanish too, uh
Shout out to World Wide Wes
Everywhere we go, we leave a worldwide mess
Yes, still Roc La Familia
Says a lot about you if you not feeling us

Five hundred million, I got a pound cake
Niggas is frontin', that's upside-down cake
Get 'em a red nose, they clown cakes
They shoulda never let you 'round cake
Look at my neck, I got a karat cake, uh
Now here's the icin' on the cake
Cake, cake-cake, cake-cake, uh
I'm just gettin' started, oh yeah, we got it, bitch
I've done made more millionaires than the lotto did
Dame made millions, Biggs made millions
Ye made millions, Just made millions
Lyor made millions, Cam made millions
Beans'a tell you if he wasn't in his feelings
Uh, I'm back in my bag
My eyes bloodshot, but my jet don't lag
A pair of Jordan 3's, tryna chase this cash
Gucci airbag just in case we crash
Uh, last night was mad trill
I'm fresh out of Advil—Jesus, grab the wheel

Yeah, uh
Look, fuck all that ""Happy to be here"" shit that y'all want me on
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog
Like I should fall in line
Like I should alert niggas when I'm 'bout to drop somethin' crazy
And not say I'm the greatest of my generation
Like I should be dressing different
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us
Like I didn't study the game to the letter
And understand that I'm not doin' it the same
Man, I'm doing it better
Like I didn't make that clearer this year
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself
But I thought ""Fuck it"", it's worth it to share 'em
With someone else other than Paris for once
I text her from time to time, she a mom now
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound
But I think she's straight
'Cause she supported since Hot Beats
Right before Wayne came and got me out of the back room
Where I was rapping with Jas over beats that I shouldn't have
In the hopes for the glory
He walked right past in the hallway
Three months later, I'm his artist
He probably wouldn't remember that story
But that shit stick with me always
Couldn't believe when he called me
You never know what could happen to you
And I just spent four Ferraris all on a brand new Bugatti
And did that shit 'cause it's somethin' to do
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg
Nothing was the same, dawg370Embed",https://images.genius.com/b428ba956c42c7e1bb1d56e729702724.486x486x1.png

Did I go out? Yeah, I went out, I went
I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit
Wine or water?
Did you say something about a cold drink? I don't know
I'm delirious

Cups of the rosé
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy
But I've been drinkin' so much
That I'ma call her anyway and say

Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up, I know he's not around, oh, oh

I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flight's in the morning

And sittin' talkin' 'bout bitches that we almost had

Outta the women I sponsor 'til it all goes bad
But, shit, it's all good
We threw a party, yeah, we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah, we threw a party
I was just callin' 'cause they were just leavin'
Talk to me, please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin' off me
Paid for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bet that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while, girl, they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin' a hard time adjustin' to fame
Sprite in there mixed up
I've been talkin' crazy, girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on
Fuck, I'm sorry

Tell me, have you heard that lately?

Gotta do what I gotta do
Yeah
Uh

All my exes live in Texas like I'm George Strait
Or they go to Georgia State where
Tuition is handled by some random nigga that live in Atlanta
That she only see when she feels obligated
Admitted it to me the first time we dated
But she was no angel and we never waited
I took her for sushi, she wanted to fuck
So we took it to go, told 'em don't even plate it
And we never talked too much after I blew up
Just only ""hello"" or a ""happy belated""
And I think I text her and told her I made it
And that's when she text me and told me she prayed it
And that's when I text her and told her I love her
Then right after, texted and told her I'm faded
She asked what have I learned since getting richer?
I learned workin' with the negatives could make for better pictures
I learned Hennessy and enemies is one hell of a mixture
Even though it's fucked up, girl, I'm still fuckin' with ya, damn
Is it the fall? Time for me to revisit the past
There's women to call, there's albums to drop, there's liquor involved
There's stories to tell, we been through it all, damn
Interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my dressing room, confusing me with questions like
You might also like
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?

Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright

Uh, so much for being optimistic
They say love is in the air, so I
Hold my breath 'til my face turn purple
Keep a few bad bitches in my circle
My nuts hang like ain't no curfew
Bitch, if you wave, then I will surf you
I flew jet, she flew commercial
But we still met later that night
After my session, she came over
I was aggressive and she was sober
I gave her a pill, she started confessin'
And started undressin' and asked me to hold her
And so I did, but that was last month
And now she's texting me asking for closure, damn
She say this shit gon' catch up to me, I keep tissue paper
We eat each other whenever we at the dinner table
She say she hate that she love me and she wish I was average
Shit, sometimes I wish the same and I wish she wasn't married
Promises, I hope I never break 'em
Met a female dragon, had a fire conversation
But interviews are like confessions
Get the fuck up out my bedroom, confusing me with questions like
Do you love this shit?
Are you high right now?
Do you ever get nervous?
Are you single?
I heard you fuck your girl, is it true?
You gettin' money?
You think them niggas you with is with you?

And I say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright
And we say hell yeah, hell yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, fuckin' right, alright
And we say hell yeah, yeah, yeah, hell yeah
Fuckin' right, damn right, alright, aw, yeah

Why you gotta fight with me at Cheesecake?
You know I love to go there
Say I'm actin' lightskin, I can't take you nowhere
This a place for families that drive Camrys and go to Disney
They don't need to know all of our business
You wildin', you super childish, you go to CVS for Kotex
In my Bugatti, I took the key and tried to hide it
So you can't drive it, and put on mileage
Then you find it, awkward silence
Mama is a saint, yes, she raised me real good
All because of her I don't do you like I should
Don't make me give you back to the hood

How many girls have slept in this bed?
Say a different number than the one that's in my head
Lying to protect you, I be doing that a lot
My past checkered like the Louis you just got
Married in our twenties, now, where the fun in that?
My city love me like a college running back
Pack a bag, you gon' end up staying where I'm at
Took you from the hood and I could never give you back
I just wanna let you know that someone love you back

First things first: rest in peace, Uncle Phil
For real
You the only father that I ever knew
I get my bitch pregnant, I'ma be a better you
Prophecies that I made way back in the Ville
Fulfilled
Listen, even back when we was broke, my team ill
Martin Luther King woulda been on Dreamville, talk to a nigga

One time for my L.A. sisters
One time for my L.A. ho
Lame niggas can't tell the difference
One time for a nigga who know

Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved
Don't save her, she don't wanna be saved

No role models, and I'm here right now
No role models to speak of
Searchin' through my memory, my memory, I couldn't find one
Last night, I was gettin' my feet rubbed by the baddest bitch
Not Trina, but I swear to God, this bitch'll make you call your girl up
And tell her, ""Hey, what's good?
Sorry, I'm never comin' home, I'ma stay for good""
Then hang the phone up and proceed to lay the wood
I came fast like 9-1-1 in white neighborhoods
Ain't got no shame 'bout it
She think I'm spoiled and I'm rich 'cause I can have any bitch
I got defensive and said, ""Nah, I was the same without it""
But then I thought back, back to a better me
Before I was a B-list celebrity
'Fore I started callin' bitches ""bitches"" so heavily
Back when you could get a platinum plaque without no melody, you wadn't sweatin' me

I want a real love, dark-skinned Aunt Viv love
That Jada and that Will love
That leave a toothbrush at your crib love
And you ain't gotta wonder whether that's your kid love
Nigga, I don't want no bitch from reality shows
Out-of-touch-with-reality hoes
Out in Hollywood bringin' back five or six hoes
Fuck 'em then we kick 'em to the do', nigga, you know how it go
She deserved that, she a bird, it's a bird trap
You think if I didn't rap she would flirt back?
Takin' off her skirt, let her wear my shirt, 'fore she leave
""I'ma need my shirt back"" (Nigga, you know how it go)
One time for my L.A. sisters

There's an old saying in Tennessee—I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee—that says, fool me once... shame on... shame on you
Fool me—can't get fooled again

Fool me one time, shame on you (Ayy)

Fool me three times, fuck the peace sign
Load the chopper, let it rain on you (Bop, bop, bop)

My only regret was too young for Lisa Bonet
My only regret was too young for Nia Long
Now all I'm left with is hoes from reality shows
Hand her a script, the bitch prolly couldn't read along

Now all I'm left with is hoes up in Greystone
With the stale face 'cause they know it's they song

Or even back when I was up there in Mohammed crib
Paying seventeen hundred for the rent, money well spent
No heater, but a nigga made heat, may I vent?
Had a thing for ya, even wrote the song ""Dreams"" for ya
‘Cause I had dreams for ya, thoughts of a ring for ya
Childish shit, you know child and shit
Anonymous flowers sent, you know coward shit
Now a nigga signed to Hov, took a power trip
Back home, I'm grown now, and the city's my throne now, huh
The same clubs that I used to get tossed out
Life got Kriss Kross'd: totally crossed out
‘Cause now I'm in this bitch and I'm totally bossed out
Old chicks crying ‘cause they know that they lost out
But I'm still on you, I'm still on you
My drink spill on me, while I feel on you, I'm sayin'—

She on a power trip, she got me where she want a nigga
Wife'ing in the club, man, my homies gon' disown a nigga
Like, ""Give me twenty dollars, dollars!""
Ass stupid, how you get to college, college?
I'm in your city and I'm wonderin' if you're home now
Went and found a man, but I'm hopin' you're alone now
Can't help but feeling like I dropped the ball, cliché
I used to pop up on you at the mall each day
Now, typically I kick game like Eastbay
But you got a nigga freeze-framed yelling: ""Please play!""
For Pete's sake, homie, pull it together
Just fuck her one time and be through with forever, but—

Yeah
Let me take y'all back, man
As I do so well
Wadn't nuttin' like that
Man, it wadn't nuttin' like that

First time, she was in my math class (Uh-huh)
Long hair, brown skin with the fat ass
Sat beside me, used to laugh, had mad jokes
The teacher always got mad, so we passed notes
It started off so innocent
She had a vibe and a nigga started diggin' it, uh
I was a youngin, straight crushin', tryna play the shit cool
But a nigga couldn't wait to get to school, ‘cause when I seen
Them thighs on her and them hips on her and them lips on her
Got me daydreamin', man, what
I'm thinkin' how she rides on it, if she sits on it, if she licks on it
Make it hard for me to stand up, as time goes by
Attractions gettin' deep and
Wet dreamin', thinkin' that I'm smashin' but I'm sleepin', I want it bad
And I ain't never been obsessed before
She wrote a note that said, ""You ever had sex before?"" Damn…

I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

I wrote back and said
""Of course I had sex before,"" knowin' I was frontin'
I said, ""I'm like a pro, baby,"" knowin' I was stuntin'
But if I told the truth, I knew that I'd get played out, son
Hadn't been in pussy since the day I came out one, but
She don't know that, so she done wrote back and told me
""Oh, you a pro, homie? Well, I want you to show me
My mama gone for the weekend
So Saturday, baby, we can get to freakin'.""
That's when my heart start racin' and my body start sweatin'
Baby, you done woke my lil' man up
I'm thinkin' how that body look naked when you layin' on the bed
Teacher, please, don't make me stand up, I wrote back like
""Yeah, baby, sound like a plan.""
Still tryna play it cool, sound like the man
But I was scared to death, my nigga, my stomach turnin'
Talkin' shit, knowin' damn well I was a virgin, fuck

Know you finna bone for the first time?
I'm hopin' that she won't notice it's my first time
I'm hopin' that my shit is big enough to fuck wit'
And most of all I'm prayin', ""God, don't let me bust quick""
I'm watchin' pornos, tryna see just how to stroke right
Practice puttin' condoms on—how it go? Right
I'm in her crib, now a nigga palm sweatin'
With a pocket full of rubbers and an erection
That's when my hands start touchin' and her face start blushin'
And a nigga roll over on top and then she
Get my pants unbuckled and her hands start rubbin'
On me, ooh girl, don't stop, it's time for action
Pull out the condoms real smooth, yeah, just how I practiced
But right before I put it in, she flinched and grabbed it and said
""I wanna get somethin' off my mental
I can tell you're a pro, but baby, be gentle, ‘cause—""
‘Cause I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no
And I ain't never did this before, no

Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now
I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it
A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how
My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!
I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real
We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still
I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still
And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell
Love yourself, girl, or nobody will
Though you a woman I don't know how you deal
With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels
I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you
You wake up, put makeup on
Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong
No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on
Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""
What it's like to have a crooked smile
You might also like
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)

To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling
You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling
You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure
And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure
‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'
So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'
Take it from a man that loves what you got
And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not
Now is it real? Eyebrows, fingernails, hair
Is it real? If it's not, girl, you don't care
‘Cause what's real is somethin' that the eyes can't see
That the hands can’t touch, that them broads can’t be
And that’s you, never let 'em see your frown
And if you need a friend to pick you up, I’ll be around
And we can ride with the windows down, the music loud
I can tell you ain’t laughed in a while
But I wanna see that crooked smile
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
We don't look nothin' like the people on the screen
You know, the movie stars, picture perfect beauty queens
But we got dreams and we got the right to chase ‘em
Look at the nation
That’s a crooked smile braces couldn’t even straighten
Seem like half the race is either on probation or in jail
Wonder why we inhale, ‘cause we in Hell already
I ask: If my skin pale, would I then sell like Eminem or Adele?
But one more time for the 'Ville
And fuck all of that beef shit, nigga, let’s make a mil
Hey officer man, we don’t want nobody gettin' killed
Just open up that cell, let my brother outta jail
I got money for the bail now, and well now
If you askin' will I tell now—ayy, hell nah
I ain’t snitchin' 'cause, man, they get them niggas stitches now
If you was around then you wouldn’t need a witness now
How you like this crooked smile?
Even though I—
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down (That crooked smile)
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

We got the crooked smile, we can style on 'em
Back round, crooked smile, we can style on 'em
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round


La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
La la la, la la la, la-la—la—la
On my way, on my way, on my way down
On my way, on my way, on my way down
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round
Back round
You were the one that was tryna keep me way down
But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round

You good, T-Minus?

Niggas been countin' me out
I’m countin' my bullets, I'm loadin’ my clips
I'm writin' down names, I'm makin' a list
I'm checkin' it twice and I'm gettin’ ’em hit
The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I’m back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I'm all in my bag, this hard as it get
I do not snort powder, I might take a sip
I might hit the blunt, but I'm liable to trip
I ain’t poppin' no pill, but you do as you wish
I roll with some fiends, I love 'em to death
I got a few mil' but not all of them rich
What good is the bread if my niggas is broke?
What good is first class if my niggas can't sit?
That's my next mission, that's why I can't quit
Just like LeBron, get my niggas more chips
Just put the Rollie right back on my wrist
This watch came from Drizzy, he gave me a gift
Back when the rap game was prayin' I'd diss
They act like two legends cannot coexist
But I'd never beef with a nigga for nothin'
If I smoke a rapper, it's gon' be legit
It won't be for clout, it won't be for fame
It won't be 'cause my shit ain't sellin' the same
It won't be to sell you my latest lil' sneakers
It won't be 'cause some nigga slid in my lane
Everything grows, it's destined to change
I love you lil' niggas, I'm glad that you came
I hope that you scrape every dollar you can
I hope you know money won't erase the pain
To the OGs, I'm thankin' you now
Was watchin' you when you was pavin' the ground
I copied your cadence, I mirrored your style
I studied the greats, I'm the greatest right now
Fuck if you feel me, you ain't got a choice
I ain't do no promo, still made all that noise
This year gon' be different, I set my intentions
I promise to slap all that hate out your voice

The real ones been dyin', the fake ones is lit
The game is off balance, I'm back on my shit
The Bentley is dirty, my sneakers is dirty
But that's how I like it, you all on my dick

I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel
If it ain't 'bout the squad, don't give a fuck
Pistol in your hand don't make you real

I'm dead in the middle of two generations
I'm little bro and big bro all at once
Just left the lab with young 21 Savage
I'm 'bout to go and meet Jigga for lunch
Had a long talk with the young nigga Kodak
Reminded me of young niggas from 'Ville
Straight out the projects, no fakin', just honest
I wish that he had more guidance, for real
Too many niggas in cycle of jail
Spending they birthdays inside of a cell
We coming from a long bloodline of trauma
We raised by our mamas, Lord, we gotta heal
We hurting our sisters, the babies as well
We killing our brothers, they poisoned the well
Distorted self-image, we set up to fail
I'ma make sure that the real gon' prevail, nigga
I just poured somethin' in my cup
I've been wantin' somethin' I can feel
Promise I am never lettin' up
Money in your palm don't make you real
Foot is on they neck, I got 'em stuck
I'ma give 'em somethin' they can feel

Bad things happen to the people you love
And you find yourself praying up to heaven above
But honestly, I've never had much sympathy
'Cause those bad things, I always saw them coming for me
I'm gonna run, run away (Oh, I), run run away, run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Run away and never come back (Well, alright)
Run run away, run run away (Oh, I), run away (Oh, I-I-I)
Show 'em that your color is black (Well, alright)

Damned if I do, damned if I don't
You know I got a girl back home
You got a man, what you want, what you want?
What these bitches want from a nigga?
On some DMX shit, huh
I know them other niggas love tricking
On some BMX shit, but not me
Now I'm sure you done heard about me
A black star, Mos Def, Kweli
Good so them bad hoes try me, they try me
This is Martin Luther King in the club, getting dubs
With a bad bitch in his ear, sayin' that she down for whatever
In the back of his mind is Coretta

To put a ring on it
Got a bitch on my dick right now
And she just want to sing on it
Got me up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
I be up so high, try and get a piece of that apple pie
Dancehall vibes with my pants on fire
'Cause I told her I was sleep
'Cause I creep with this pretty young thing that I chose
She could be doing the same thing, I suppose
And she knows, she knows

Sometimes you worry 'bout the things he can provide for ya
Whenever you around I seem to come alive for ya
I finally recognize the feelings that's inside for ya
Although I know your man and trust me he would die for ya
These quiet thoughts of you been going on for years now
I saw you in the party, soft lips, soft-spoken
I came to talk to you but homie interfered now
He introduced you as his girl and I was heartbroken
Some people talk about that love at first sight shit
To keep it real I don't know whether I believe it's true
But if it is then tell me if I'm wrong or right if
I fell in love with you before I ever even knew
I catch your eye then look away as if it never happened
At times I feel as though I'm caught up in a strange dream
If eyes could talk then mines would tell ya that I'm feeling you (Feeling you)
Sometimes I swear your eyes be telling me the same thing

Huh, I'm staring at you from afar
I'm wondering 'bout you, like where you from and who you are
'Cause you a star, no, not the type that snort the white lines
I mean the type that light the night time
I heard you got a man, but who in their right mind letting you out the house alone?
Tell me is your house a home?
Why you in the club looking like you out to zone?
Now be discreet and pull out your phone and put my number in it
Text a nigga when your man leave you unattended
On a scale from 1 to 10 that girl's a hundred and I want it
No question, I know destiny well
And though I sin the Lord blessing me still
Every saint got a past, every sinner got a future
Every loser gotta win and every winner gotta lose someday

Compared to some my niggas down the block, man, we were blessed
And life can't be no fairy tale, no once upon a time
But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me, Momma please, why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?

Livin' with nothin' to lose, I hope one day you hear me

Fuck you 'cause there, there is no right or wrong, only a song

Think back to Forest Hills, no perfect home
But the only thing like home I've ever known
Until they snatched it from my mama
And foreclosed her on the loan
I'm so sorry that I left you there to deal with that alone
I was up in New York City chasing panties, getting dome
Had no clue what you was going through
How could you be so strong?
And how could I be so selfish? I know I can be so selfish
I could tell by how I treat you with my girl, damn, she so selfless
But she put up with my ways because she loves me like you do
And though it don't always show, I love her just like I love you, and
I need to treat you better
Wish you could live forever
So we could spend more time together, uh
I love you mama, uh

Another day, another time zone
Today, I woke up feeling horny so it's only right, I got two bitches playing on my trombone
Keep up, never sure where the words would take me

Shit trump tight never slurred it lazy
Give a virgin the urge to rape me, nigga please

Aim for the stars and I shouldn't have missed
But I was riding on fumes, so I stopped by the moon
Now I'm sitting on the hood of this bitch
Like, ""Thanks for the view,"" waiting on thanks from a few
'Cause without me you wouldn't exist
You know that shit, gave you the blueprint, don't forget
Cole is your phone on zero percent
Going off, now niggas showing off
Niggas swear they hard, but they flowing soft

She my number one, I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time

Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over

All a nigga know is how to fuck a good thing up
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

(Who's the king?)
Came from the bottom, nigga, with stains on my shirt
What you expected from me, I came from the dirt (Who's the king?)
Money my motivator, the songs that I sing
Picture a peasant passin' from pawn to a king
(Who's the king?)
You tell me you still love me, if so then let me go
Will I return or will I burn, never know (Who's the king?)
Look in my eyes and see the future
But don't sugar coat it (Yeah)
Listen, history repeats itself and that's just how it goes
Same way that these rappers always bite each other's flows
Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock 'n Roll
Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore
While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound
This year I'll prolly go to the awards dappered down
Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit
Same rope you climb up on, they hang you with
But not Jermaine, my aim too sick
I bang, nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick
You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid
I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid
And break the chains and change minds
One verse at a time, and claim 2-6
And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?
We all kings (We all kings, nigga)
Kings of ourselves first and foremost
(True)
While the people debate who's the king of this rap game (Hehehaha)
Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
With every ounce of strength in his veins
To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it (True)
But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic
With a flash and a bang, the crown disintegrates
And falls to the Earth from which it came
It's done
Ain't gon' be no more kings (Ain't gon' be no more kings)
Be wary of any man that claims
Because deep down he clings onto the need for power (Mm)
In reality he's a coward (Mm)
Ultimately he's scared to die
And sometimes so am I
But when I'm in tune with the most high
I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side (The other side, ayy)
Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I (Yessir)
Different kind of skin, different set of eyes
Two different minds, but only one God (It's only one God, nigga)
It's for all the kings (Uh)

(For your eyes, for your eyes)
For your eyes only

Hey, niggas be dyin' on the daily
It seems my dreams faded for far too long
The consequences deadly
Can't visualize myself as nothin' but a criminal
Control the block, servin' up rocks and stay subliminal
'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they lettin' off
Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause
Ain't no comin' back, family dressed in black
Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack
And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressin' me
Like I ain't the one who put them Js on her feet
Like I ain't out in the field like that
I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless
Screamin', ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless
That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic
To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
I try to find employment even if it's wipin' toilets
But these felonies be makin' life the hardest
Resistin' the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike, and pawn it
That's why I write this sonnet
If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) Let her know my life is on it
(For your eyes) For your eyes only

You prolly grown now, so this song'll hit you
If you hearin' this, unfortunately means that I'm no longer with you
In the physical, not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
He got me prayin' that the spiritual is real
So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too
So I know how part of you feels
Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me
Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me
I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots
And fiends that smoke rocks
I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
I'm writin' this because me and the devil had a dance
Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizin' in advance
Don't know if I ever had a chance
At a glance, I'm a failure
Addicted to pushin' paraphernalia
But daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once
Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
My pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted
So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hangin'
Blood was stainin' the concrete
Older niggas I loved, talked like they was above
Maintainin' a timesheet, that's slow money
Picked up the family business, by the age of thirteen
Six years later was handed sentence
'Round the same time is when you came in this world
Me and your mama thinkin':
""What the fuck we namin' this girl?""
I told her, ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of (Most prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen)
For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was nineteen
Took me two felonies to see the trap this crooked-ass system set for me
And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
The one that set examples that was never set for me
I'm livin' fast, but not fast enough
'Cause karma keeps on catchin' up to me
And if my past becomes the death of me
I hope you understand
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand)
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand? (Hope you understand)
For your eyes, do you understand me?
For your eyes, do you understand?

It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count
Was it the trigger-happy crackers that the badges give clout?
Was it the young niggas, blastin' frustrated 'cause the cash runnin' out?
Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
See, baby girl, I realized my definition of a real nigga was skewed
My views misshaped by new mixtapes
That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo
And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food
I was a fool, spent all my time duckin' school, duckin' cops
Duckin' rules, huggin' blocks that don't love you
I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you
Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops
And the cyclical nature of doin' time continues
My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
And see your father face while hearin' 'bout tragedy on news
I got the strangest feelin' your daddy gonna lose his life soon
And sadly if you're listenin' now it must mean it's true
But maybe there's a chance that it's not
And this album remains locked in a hard drive like valuable jewels
And I can teach you this in person like I'm teachin' you to tie your own shoes
I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
For your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, for your eyes only
For your eyes, do you understand?
For your eyes only

One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feelin'
What he'd been dealin' with lately, he wasn't tellin'
I tried to pick his brains, still, he wasn't revealin'
But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
And it was chillin', he said:
""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children
I never asked for nothin', when times was hard
I never had discussions with you, beggin' you to help me
I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
But that shit was in my blood, you know my life
I know your momma, nigga, send my love
In case I never get a chance to speak again
I won't forget the weekends spent sleepin' at your crib
That's the way I wished my family lived
But my granny crib was in the 'jects""
I had to interject like:
""Nigga, what you talkin' 'bout? Fuck is you gettin' at?""
He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions
But I been havin' premonitions
Just call it visions from the other side
I got a feelin' I won't see tomorrow
Like the time I'm livin' on is borrowed
With that said, the only thing I'm proud to say, I was a father
Write my story down, and if I pass
Go play it for my daughter when she ready""
And so I'm leavin' you this record, for your eyes only
Don't you ever scratch or disrespect it
This perspective is a real one, another lost 'Ville son
I dedicate these words to you and all the other children
Affected by the mass incarceration in this nation
That sent your pops to prison when he needed education
Sometimes I think that segregation would've done us better
Although I know that means that I would never
Be brought into this world 'cause my daddy was so thrilled
When he found him a white girl to take back to Jonesboro
With lil' Zach and Cole World, barely one years old
Now it's thirty years later, makin' sure this story's told
Girl, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was cold
Not because he was the first to get some pussy, twelve years old
Not because he used to come through in the Caddy on some vogues
Not because he went from baggin' up them grams to servin' O's
Nah, your daddy was a real nigga, not 'cause he was hard
Not because he lived a life of crime and sat behind some bars
Not because he screamed, ""Fuck the law""
Although that was true
Your daddy was a real nigga 'cause he loved you

Everybody say the music that they make is dumb
I remember I was 18
Money, pussy, parties, I was on the same thing
You gotta give a boy a chance to grow some
Everybody talkin' like they know somethin' these days
Niggas actin' woke, but they broke, umm
I respect the struggle but you all frontin' these days
Man, they barely old enough to drive
To tell them what they should do, who the fuck am I?
I heard one of 'em dissed me, I'm surprised
I ain't trippin', listen good to my reply
Come here lil' man, let me talk with ya
See if I can paint for you the large picture
Congrats 'cause you made it out your mama house
I hope you make enough to buy your mom a house
I see your watch icy and your whip foreign
I got some good advice, never quit tourin'
'Cause that's the way we eat here in this rap game
I'm fuckin' with your funky lil' rap name
I hear your music and I know that rap's changed
A bunch of folks would say that that's a bad thing
'Cause everything's commercial and it's pop now
Trap drums is the shit that's hot now
See, I've been on a quest for the next wave
But never mind, that was just a segue
I must say, by your songs I'm unimpressed, hey
But I love to see a Black man get paid
And plus, you havin' fun and I respect that
But have you ever thought about your impact?
These white kids love that you don't give a fuck
'Cause that's exactly what's expected when your skin black
They wanna see you dab, they wanna see you pop a pill
They wanna see you tatted from your face to your heels
And somewhere deep down, fuck it, I gotta keep it real
They wanna be black and think your song is how it feels
So when you turn up, you see them turnin' up too
You hit the next city, collect your money when it's due
You gettin' that paper, swimmin' in bitches, I don't blame you
You ain't thinkin' 'bout the people that's lookin' like me and you
True, you got better shit to do
You coulda bought a crib with all that bread that you done blew
I know you think this type of revenue is never endin'
But I wanna take a minute just to tell you that ain't true
One day, them kids that's listening gon' grow up
And get too old for that shit that made you blow up
Now your show's lookin' light cause they don't show up
Which unfortunately means the money slow up
Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped 'cause you was ridin' trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
'Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain't judgin' you
I'm just tellin' you what's probably gon' happen when you rappin'
'Bout the type of shit you rappin' 'bout
It's a faster route to the bottom
I wish you good luck
I'm hoping for your sake that you ain't dumb as you look
But if it's really true what people sayin'
And you call yourself playin' with my name
Then I really know you fucked, trust
I'll be around forever 'cause my skills is tip-top
To any amateur niggas that wanna get rocked
Just remember what I told you when your shit flop

I guess the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope, sellin' dope
Okay, the neighbors think I'm sellin' dope,  sellin' dope
Sellin' dope, sellin' dope, sellin' dope

Yeah, I don't want no picture with the president
I just wanna talk to the man
Speak for the boys in the bando
And my nigga never walkin' again
'pologize if I'm harpin' again
I know these things happen often
But I'm back on the scene
I was lost in a dream
As I write this, the team down in Austin
I been buildin' me a house
Back home in the South, ma
Won't believe what it's costin'
And it's fit for a king, right?
Or a nigga that could sing
And explain all the pain that it cost him
My sixteen should've came with a coffin
Fuck the fame and the fortune
Well, maybe not the fortune
But one thing is for sure though
The fame is exhaustin'
That's why I moved away, I needed privacy
Surrounded by the trees and Ivy League
Students that's recruited highly
Thinkin' ""You do you and I do me""
Crib has got a big 'ol back 'ol yard
My niggas stand outside and pass cigars
Filled with marijuana, laughin' hard
Thankful that they friend's a platinum star
In the driveway there's no rapper cars
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Just some shit to get from back and forth
Welcome to the Sheltuh, this is pure
We'll help you if you've felt too insecure
To be the star you always knew you were
Wait, I think police is at the door

Death, taxes, and a ra-

Every nigga feel like a candidate
For a Trayvon kinda fate
Even when your crib sit on a lake
Even when your plaques hang on a wall
Even when the president jam your tape
Took a little break just to annotate
How I feel, damn, it's late
I can't sleep cause I'm paranoid
Black in a white man territory
Cops bust in with the army guns
No evidence of the harm we done
Just a couple neighbors that assume we slang

Uh

Since a youngin' always dreamed of gettin' rich
Look at me, my nigga
Fantasize about a white picket fence
With some trees, my nigga
Used to want a Pathfinder with some tints
That's all I need, my nigga
Throw some 20's on that bitch and get it rinsed
But now I see, my nigga
That the world's a lot bigger ever since
Picked up the paper
And they say my nigga Eddie caught a body, I'm convinced
Anybody is a killer, all you gotta do is push 'em to the limits
Fuck being timid in the Civic
Politicin' with the pushers and the pimps
I'm tryna write a story, can I get a glimpse?
Yeah, can I get a glimpse?
Last night I had a bad dream (Bad dream, bad dream)
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing? (Bad thing, bad thing)
They robbin' niggas on the daily
Can you blame a nigga that ain't never had things?
(What's the value of a thing?) Guess not
Last night they pulled up on my nigga at the light like—
Ugh, nice watch, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air, run it
Hands in the air now, hands in the air
Hands in the air now, hands in the air

Fuck with me, my nigga
We gon' circle 'round the Ville and hit a lick
Cop some trees, my nigga
And some powder, bag it up and make it flip
You gon' see, my nigga
One day we gon' graduate and cop a brick
And that's the key, my nigga
Listen up, I'm 'bout to go and get rich
Stand back and watch if you want to, nigga
Me, I want my pockets fat, a badder bitch
Tired of seein' niggas flaunt, I wanna flaunt too, nigga
Watch some rollers in a fuckin' Crown Vic
Tryna lock a nigga up, that's what they won't do, nigga
Wanna know a funny thing about this shit?
Even if you let 'em kill your dream
It'll haunt you, nigga, haunt you
Last night I had a bad dream
That I was trapped in this city
Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?
I look around like—
Do you wanna be another nigga, that ain't never had things? (What's the value of a thing?)

I look outside and all the clouds are gray
I need your hands to take me miles away
Your wish is my command, my command, my command
But before you go I've got to warn you now

Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip

Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, ""baby, don't yell""
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death

La la la (Yeah)
La la la la la (Yeah)

I grew up, a fucking screw up, tie my shoe up
Wish they was newer, damn, need something newer
In love with the baddest girl in the city, I wish I knew her
I wish I wasn't so shy, I wish I was a bit more fly
I wish that I could tell her how I really feel inside
That I'm the perfect nigga for her, but then maybe that's a lie
She like a certain type of nigga, and it's clear I'm not that guy
Ball player, star player, I'm just watchin' from the side
On the bench, 'cause my lack of confidence won't let me fly
I ain't grow up with my father, I ain't thinkin' 'bout that now
Fast forward four years or so from now, I'll probably cry
When I realize what I missed, but as of now my eyes are dry
'Cause I'm tryna stay alive, in the city where too many niggas die
Dreamin' quiet trying to dodge a suit and tie
Who am I? (La la la)
Ayy, who am I? (La la la la la, yeah)

I might bend a little bit but I don't fold
One time for my mind and two for yours
I got food for your thoughts to soothe your soul
If you see my tears fall, just let me be
Move along, nothing to see

I always did shit the hard way
My nigga  slangin' in the hallway
Burnt CD's and trees like this was Broadway
Times Square, kept the dimes there in the locker
Some Reggie Miller with more brown hairs than Chewbacca
Whispers that he got it for the low-low, sell a
Dime for a dub, them white boys ain't know no better
Besides, what's twenty dollars to a nigga like that?
He tell his pops he need some lunch and he gon' get it right back
I peeped game, got home snatched my mama keychain
Took her whip, the appeal, too ill to refrain
I hit the boulevard, pull up to my nigga front do'
His mama at home, she still let 'em hit the blunt though
I told her, ""Hello"", and sat with my nigga and laughed
And talked about how we gon' smash all the bitches in class
I complimented how I see him out here getting his cash
And just asked, ""What a nigga gotta do to get that?
Put me on,"" he just laughed when he seen I was sure
17 years breathing, his demeanor said more
He told me, ""Nigga, you know how you sound right now?
If you wasn't my mans, I would think that you a clown right now
Listen, you everything I wanna be, that's why I fucks with you
So how you looking up to me when I look up to you?
You 'bout to go get a degree, I'ma be stuck with two choices:
Either graduate to weight or selling number two
For what? A hundred bucks or two a week?
Do you think that you would know what to do if you was me?
I got, four brothers, one mother that don't love us
If they ain't want us, why the fuck they never wore rubbers?""
I felt ashamed to have ever complained
About my lack of gear and thought about how far we done came
From trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky
Thank you mama, dry your eyes, there ain't no reason to cry
You made a genius and I, ain't gon' take it for granted
I ain't gon' settle for lesser, I ain't gon' take what they handed
Nah, I'm gon' take what they owe me and show you that I can fly
And show old girl what she missing, the illest nigga alive
Ayy, who am I?

It ain't always for the better, dawg, I can't lie (Who am I?)
I get high 'cause the lows can be so cold
I might bend a little bit but I don't fold

Ayy, we've got a good thing
Don’t know if I’ma see you again
But is that a good thing?
'Cause girl, I can’t be your man, no ma'am

Like, “Is it the real thing
Or is it just a one-night stand?”

Now, girl, won't you drop that thing down to the floor?
I’m here for one night, how far will you go?

I’m here for one night, how far will you go?
I wanna see you (Work out for me, work out for me)

She like them boys with the big ol' chains
Ridin' around town in a big ol' Range
I knew her when I rocked big ol' jeans
Now the little nigga doin' big ol' thangs
Would you look at that? I came back for her
Just to give it to ya, like you asked for it
Man, that thing in them jeans too fat for her
Rebounds so I caught her off the backboard
I told her: “Baby girl, come here
Know I run the town even when I ain't from there.”
And I brag hardly, but just to show up at this party
I made what yo' nigga make in one year
That's unfair, but so is life, take a chance, roll the dice

Look, never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh

And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
Niggas thinkin' that they fuckin' with JID, y'all got the game fucked up
Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
""Oh, my God, don't be mean to me""

And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
Bird bitch, take flight, no pilot
Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
I got to get on stage, you better get on page
I have you looking out the windowpane
Or in the rain or anything but in a way
And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king, ayy)
Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s (Yeah, uh)

Again, never been shit, never had shit, (Woah) never knew shit (Woah)
Never out, never do shit, damn (Look)
But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
Never had shit, I'ma take
Never asking, ""Give me this, give me that shit
Give me everything, nigga, fuck you…""

Let's go
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, what?
Umm

Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan some'
You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
She moan, sound like German or something
Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
You need work, you need purpose
Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
We don't dap niggas, get the rrr-rat from the ratchet
Get the pack out the package
Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait (Yeah)
Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticle
Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo

I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
That it's too soon to for—

Push the fuckin' pack off of the porch or break a pound down
Get this strap, if it happen to blow, it make surround sounds
Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down (Oh, oh, woah)
Puttin' rap on my back, and I'm black and snatchin' crowns (Uh, woah, shit)

I done came back around
Like a nigga sellin' crack in pounds
I got a bag now, but it's nothing to brag 'bout
Gun blast in the background (Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo)
I'm a black man with the bloodhounds
MAC-10 makin' love sounds
To a bad chick, she from Uptown
I'm from down South, not a loudmouth (Can't you see?)
We can fuck around (Woah, shit, woah)
Hit the music, baby, cut it down (Woah, shit, woah)
Hit a doobie while you do me indubitably (Woah)
I feel like I'ma bust now (Woah, shit, woah)
I feel like a bust down (Woah, shit, woah)
When I shine bright, blind niggas is up now (Woah, shit, woah, shit)
In the cut, big black truck, pack sacked up (Woah, shit, woah, shit)

I know I can't afford to stop for one moment
That it's too soon to for—

Me and my money attached emotionally
I get to clutchin' if you get too close to me
I'm at the top where I'm 'posed to be
Jumped in the game, niggas act like they coaching me
Four hundred racks ain't shit but a show to me
I'm on the road and I bet that your ho with me
When I'm in traffic, it's always a pole wit' me
Pillsbury man, I keep dough with me (Can't you see?)
Hit from the back, she givin' me slurp, and I ain't even pull my pants down
Jump in the box and slide to the other side, it's always a man down
Draw down, hands in the air, nigga, make one move, get gunned down
Givin' out smoke so long, they don't even wanna talk no more, they just run now (Can't you see?)
No locked doors, I serve with a chop
Bitch got spent, she was hangin' with a opp
We call him Mickey, he talk to the cops
I was on Pinedale, glass in the sock
Back in the day, I invest in the block
Fast forward, now I'm investin' in stocks
I put a drum on the Heckler & Koch
Don't play 'cause I'm very invested in shots
Push the fuckin' pack off of the porch or break a pound down
Get this strap, if it happen to blow, it make surround sounds
Pussycat on my lap, push it back and go to town down
Putting rap on my back, and I'm black and snatchin' crowns (Can't you see?)

I put the pussycat in his face 'cause he stay off Cheshire Bridge
Then I took it back, now he say that he shakin' and he shiverin'
Like the way it taste and he ain't ate it in a minute

Talk shit, run that motherfuckin' crown, you bitch
Motherfuckin' bitch
Hehehaha (Uh, shit)

Sorry in advance for my bros
They'll whoop a nigga ass, what you whippin' up? (Woah)
JID in the back if you lookin' for the dope
Niggas got it in the bag 'cause we trappin' on the low
And I'm the shit with the flow, huh
Give me a joke
Heard a nigga say that you the next? No, no, no
I'm the best, tell 'em bitches stop the motherfuckin' press
Press stop, fuck a top-five list, get 'em a vest
He get lopsided
Fuck the cops, we was runnin' from Rottweilers
Most of my partners ain't have poppa, just a popped condom
Couple kids with Alzheimer's
.40 on his side, boy, you Mike Alstott, he on the block violent
Robbin' niggas in the hood and then swap genres
Green light, line a nigga up, stop sign him
Keep drivin', you will not find him
I'm a, I'm a, I'm an, I'm an anomaly
I turned into a rapper ironically
And ran the bag up, back up, niggas is onto me (Woah, shit, woah, shit)
Niggas should honor me, if you think I'm a wannabe (Woah, shit)
It's pretty comedy, I'm melancholy and cool (Woah, shit, woah, shit)
So calmly bustin' moves, my truths carry velocity (Woah, shit)

Take your heart, don't let me break it in two
I'm sure that I could possibly do nothin' for you
I'm nearly on the edge, I'm 'bout to jump in a few
I'm really not afraid of nothin'

Look, on everything
I gave everything and got nothing back
Ain't looking for no pat on backs
That ain't how we got where the fuck we at
Mama called, ""Where the fuck you at?""
""On the road, and I ain't coming back
Until my hundred stacks make a hundred racks
And that hundred racks bring a bundle back""
I was blowin' gas like the Honey Badger
J.I.D, bitch, the money snatcher
C'est la vie, shit, I'm coming after everybody
Don't get the bloody splatter
I'm fly and I got my niggas fly too
Shit is like buddy passes
I wanna cry 'cause I'm numb inside (Ugh)
If you wonder why, ask, ""What's the matter?"" (Yeah)

'Cause I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds

And you got a new job? Tell me, how that shit working out? Heh
Heard you doing pretty good, yeah, people talk, word of mouth
Wasn't 'round when you had the dirty house
Now they won't leave when you kick 'em out
These type of people can't stick around
Only down when there's liquor 'round or the spliff around
That's why I don't fuck with niggas now
Well, I fuck with all my niggas, you know the difference
You been living with tunnel vision
You and all of your friends are like wonder women
Wonder Woman working for it, if you ever wanted something
Searching for a purpose, I see what you on
The difference in how you be using your gifts
In the midst of the shit that you dealing with
Really specific, you paid attention, panoramic
You got the vision like a fer-de-lance
You attack and you kill it, sinkin' your teeth with the venom
Kinda like me with these instrumentals
Or the pen and the pencil or off the temple
Pimpin' since been pimpin', keep it sensible
Since you winning, you a object of ridicule
Objects appearing closer than you ready for
Obviously, you don't know what's ahead
But that's the reason you can work 'til you dead
I been working hella hard, shit ain't really working out
I been praying to the Lord, shit ain't really working out
I been looking to the stars, keep my head up in the clouds

Gotta watch what you say when you lookin' at me
Lookin' at God, lookin' for leaders, lookin' for keys
Look at the pain in your eyes, nigga, look where we been
Look at our wins, look at our sins, and look at our skin
I've been on a frenzy binge tryna get me a Benz
And then your fuzzy ass lens wanna fuck up the ends
Oh God, no, where are my friends?
Lord forgive me, yeah, I need to repent
Mind blurred, need to lay off the drugs
Yeah God, they ain't prayin' enough

Nah, I'm playin', nigga racist as fuck
Told my nigga if he leave a pack of ports around me, I'ma take em'

And we almost had got into fightin'
I'm talkin' 'bout dead that, finna fade it
But shit, but maybe I did too much
But fuck it, I love my nigga, I'ma save him
And he prolly thinkin' I'm a player-hater
I don't hate a player, I just need all my niggas to wake up
And take a real good look, we a long way from Decatur
Long days still ahead of us, grown dads still scared of us
I'm just workin' my incredible
Stick my dick in the inevitable
So fuck whatever happen, fuckin' cinematic
Sins of the father, I'm a fuckin' addict
Understand addiction, so I'm sympathetic

I ain't tryna be where I don't belong

Grab your lady, masturbation on her face
An acne patient acting patient, so complacent
Comfortable, a basic bowl of shit
Hold my own, I own my dick
Go shalom, I’m unpredictable
And roll with the clique and fold with big clips
I know I'm feelin' activated when I came in this bitch
Claiming the 6, I don’t care about being famous and shit
I was a bad little never had, nigga get the bag
Give it back to my fam, boy I am who I am
Hope I don't get in a jam in a jam

Dat slick talk followed by some stick talk then sleep
Pissed off, I done took my fifth loss this week
Big dog, I can scratch that shit off like fleas
I got a lotta shit to say, but I'ma keep my list short
I know alotta your favorites not gon' fuck with this part
When I'm done, please know that I was trying to diss y'all
'Cause if this is a competition, then I’m setting this bar
In my city, who’s with me? I'm in my own lane, jack
Niggas said JID so flame, I propane rap
I’m from East Atlanta like Gucci and Travis Porter
But my story is similar to the hare and the tortoise
Pen so sharp told stories you thought I forged it
Back in the fourth grade, never read Curious Jorge
My nigga Corey kept a little 40 inside his North Face
Left a nigga with no face and beat the court case
Coming home from ball practice, took the street the short way
We from the East, but never gave niggas a reason
To try it or think it's easy, soft pussy niggas eat the sorbet
Or eating your face, or squeeze the heat, then leaving your place
I've been telling you life's a bitch, but it’s a beach in your case
I've been yelling and throwing fits, I'm tired of screaming all day
I've been fighting these fucking demons all day
Man, this shit ain't never been easy, maybe I just need a breather
Hand your boy the blower, let me squeeze it
Blow a little steam, I ain't hating, I'm just heated
Niggas know what I mean, but niggas don't know what I been through
So if I offend you then, uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh
I heard niggas looking for a problem
But we don't even move until the rent due
My niggas' hands itching, finna rob something
Better pray to God that he don't get you

Better pray to God that he don't get you (Our Father)
Better pray to God
Look, okay
Fuck what a nigga say or, look, my mama think I made it
Lift my head to the skies, I cry and begin prayer
Thanks to the maker, got me out of an awful place
My nigga gone for 17 years like a cicada
More than a motivator for me to get off my anus
And kick ass like I'm Danny Mainus
Put the pen pad to the paper, big mad with a painting brush
Splish splash, drawing scenes from my dim lit past
Dimwit, pimp shit, syndicate with the pen grip
Ripping shit, intimate, infinite rhyme kicking, l-l-let's begin
Who's your list? Your top 10? You can say whoever better than
I'm ready now, I was ready then, I was headed down the aisle
Rap game in a wedding gown, she gave me the ring
I said, ""Yes"" and vowed for forever now
On the honeymoon getting naked now
On a money pile doing doggystyle
I'm a father now, and you are my child
Or you aren't my child, I'm on Maury now
And I'm talking loud, the results are found
You are not the, wow, I should kill this bitch like a doggy pound
We divorcing now
I want the cars, ring, clothes, all the house
And you broke my heart, I'm re-organizing
And really trying to be mature about it
But I gotta kill it like a fucking villain
Dream-villain, Spill-villain, rhyme to the ceiling
Would I should I kill a rapper 'cause I coulda
Duh nigga, this a gun and a bullet
I heard niggas looking for a problem
But we don't even move till' the rent due
My niggas' hands itching, finna rob something

Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you
Better pray to God that he don't get you

Hit me back, lil' nigga

Now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""
Glued to my apparatus, pussy harass us
Me and Siri moving steery so that shit don't matter
And, yes, them things gon' flash if you want to act up

Dead 'em from every side of the spectrum
Hannibal Lecter lecture, body part bone collector
Nosy ass hoes get punched in the septum
That's part of the woes for throwing salt like Epsom
Pardon my bros, kinda off the rocker and steps
Don't step, stupid, or you get slept stupid
East side, Lil' Route, Zone 6 vet
Showin' respect, a nigga forever in debt, but don't forget it
Anybody wanna see 'em, I can make 'em a believer
At your neck like Gillette, get you and the nigga next to ya
In present time they sayin' that I'm the next nigga
Woah, woah, that kinda sound like a death trap
Can't see the floor, elevator, where the steps at?
James Bond' 9—James Harden with the step-back
No D, niggas playin' foul, where the techs at?
That's cool, wave the 30 round, where the TECs at?
Better get back, better get you a jetpack
They shoot where the ref at
They shoot at your jefe
They leavin' 'em stank like Pepé Le Pew
They just put a hole in his Pepe
I go where the check at, Margiella Gorilla
They kill a nigga for a thrill, they feel it now, cool, keep it movin'
I won't be the nigga they taking out, breaking down, face down
As far as these rappers man, these words couldn't hurt a nigga
Far as these rappers, I can't count on a ninja turtle's finger
Who really is fucking with the kid, that is J.I.D
I am loud, that is mid, I'm a pound, that's a smidge
I'm a stallion, stout, strong, war ready, resilient
Guess the Lord put me in position just to kill niggas
A warrior, but words used is my spear
My sword, my fear, my Lord, my chance is void if I
Do it for myself and don't give back to the loyal
The unemployed, all my boys in here

Oh shit, I feel a change and a shift in niggas' thinkin'
Like Lute, I got the jugg, I'ma say it's quite the finagle
Get rich and make some babies that's weirder than Will and Jada's
But lately, I've been blocked up
Lately, I've been strugglin' with ways to get my stock up
Me and Venus workin' on new videos to blockbust and city shows and pop-ups
And really though I feel as though there's no bitch I could not fuck
Niggas make art and act hard for no Oscar
Boy, you're just Leonardo
Born in the life you had to learn to be part of
Still, no deal, still whippin' the Mazda, but fuck

""Niggas ain't seein' you, Venus""—shit, and I ain't seeing me
So many nights at the bottom, swore I was ET
My mama beat me, mu'fuck a degree
I chose both pills—my thoughts 3D
And often I probably come off so off the deep beat
That a lil' nigga like me gotta keep at least two or three BPs
In the blunt, they're off a DP as the rain pops off of these street
And the pain pops me another one to the brain
I let the strain do what you can't, I know it's hard out tryna reach me, huh
I'm battling addiction, I'm peeping premonitions
I'm clutching on my last dollars, I'm stretching common sense
A pressure point a keeper so I question my existence
Be assessing my involvement, second-guessing my deliverance
Lord, Ezekiel take the wheel, I'm flying in the young
Out of luck, out of hope to fuck up
So motherfuck a time limit, I'ma take what's mine, nigga
Ha—now, elevate my status to ""Gucci bag us""

Hasta luego, I'm finna break

All of my, all of my life
I been chasing a check and I never get it
Been around it, seen it, never had it
Mama, daddy, whole family, broke family
I'ma get it, told 'em I'll fuckin' handle it
And murder the game so the service candlelit
Emergency lane and I'm swerving, damaging the whip
But shit, fuck it, I'm fucking vanishing
Had to get out of Atlanta for a little minute
You know that there's madness in the fuckin' city
I thought it was love here
I thought I was good, I'm stuck in the mud here
I'm looking for drugs
I'm looking for big butts with the good hair
Or a ten-piece hot lemon pepper sprinkled
Fries crinkled, that's the lingo
If that's your girlfriend, she acting single
I caught the pass like I'm Ochocinco
I hit the gas down ocho cinco, like 85
It's like 8 or 9 'o clock, my nine cocked
If you on my guap, I won't stop 'til that boy go pop
They won't stop 'til they boy like Pac
They just pop 'til they brain fall out (Damn)
They never know what I be talking about
I only do it 'cause they never really talking about it
Bout it, bout it, turn the music louder, louder
How the fuck did anyone assume the God
The Son, the Son of God, the runnin' from the money
Bleed the blood just like the money, it's not Jumanji
I'm the doom that damned the dungeon
I'm the spoon that fed the hungry
Stand for something, fall for nothing, all or nothing
Y'all niggas balling, huh?
Just to find out that shit is all for nothing
You might also like
I been going crazy, somebody pray for me
Take a second, take a knee
It'll mean everything, it'll mean everything to me

I tell 'em to get out the way, I'm finna take it to 'em
Hasta luego, we finna make a move
Give me a break, what is you saying to 'em?
Give me the 'K, I'm finna spray the room
I'm finna spray the room (Shit, uh, okay)

Ok, everybody rich, everybody skraight, yeah, everybody ballin'
I never had shit, mind over matter, outside, I can't call it
All my niggas finna get a job, or they already got it
Couple trapping, couple catching bodies
Please don't come to East Atlanta, shawty
With your bullshit and your flex cap tryna' juug shit
Nah nigga, you'se a good lick, be a good guy, you a good kid
Never really understood this
But it's probably not for me to understand
I just played the cards I was fucking handed
And dealt with it like a fucking man
You my nigga then you my nigga then
Then we stick together like we Huck and Finn
We gon' get the chicken while we fucking hens
Don't let any nigga come fuck up the plan
If we gotta ride, well then, fuck it, then
If a nigga die, it got out of hand
If I touch the sky then my other guys
Recognize, must avenge
Jeopardize, I publicize, justified
When we busted in, were you terrified?
Was it televised when them rebel guys started busting heads
Over what a nigga said or do to JID?
These the crazy niggas that I grew up with
In the shady city that I grew up in
They ain't doin' shit, but they doin' shit
Hasta luego, I gotta get up away from here
Hoping that somebody pray for me
Telling you it'll mean everything
Everything you know what I mean
There's no working no emergency
I don't wanna be a burden, yeah
I just really hope you love a nigga when he's hurting

I tell 'em get out the way, I'm finna take it to 'em
Hasta luego, we finna make a move
Give me a break, what is you saying to 'em
Give me the 'K, I'm finna spray the room

My girl booty soft and it's shaped like a skrawberry
Her pussy bald with a tat like Stephon Marbury
Carry all my dirt to the grave, I'm the pallbearer
Bury all of my sins, staring out of the Benz
Gone off weed, gone off Hen', gone with the wind
Gone with the pretty long heiress with the fairest skin
Yelling in her face, and she repeat it like a parrot and
Apparently, she gone keep yelling at me, I'ma never win
Where your ass was at when I was sleeping on the couch
And in the whip?
Probably with another nigga, on another nigga dick
I'm on another tip, my skin so tint, strength on strength
One on ten against me, I won't break, I don't bend
Watch your statements, guard your chin
Guard your heart, guard your light
Find your zen, mind your lightness
You doing without cause you ain't looking within
But if you ever in doubt, give this a spin

Yeah, for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl, I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down (I said)
Everybody needs somebody to hold them down

Check, look, cool
I mean shawty had relations that we never could speak about
You get mad, I'm mad, we sleep it out
And then she had a man who used to beat her
So she told me she wanted out
Got a couple abortions, now that pussy's a haunted house
Now her heart cold, Antartica, Siberia
Had it planned out, curriculum, criteria
Change, she feel pain, strain, built-up anger
From dealing with a dickhead, putting her life in danger
I understand, it's times that you go through your women things
And sometimes can't gauge clearly on what you be thinking
I swear I got your back and got the tab on what you drinking
You ain't gotta move a finger or pinky when we linking
Whatever keeps your boat afloat or ship sinking
From loose lips of side women stepping out of position
Breaking out of a system, prison
Parallelogram, shaping the prism, stop signs never stopped I
Let's be realistic, I been trying to get in touch with my senses
And be better to my sisters
But niggas think that you feminine when you sensitive
My homegirl rap, and she feminist
Hold it down for the women, I call her ""Feminem""
Tell 'em how you really feel headass
'Cause ass shots are dead ass and fake tits been around, we gas it
Girl, you perfect without that makeup or the plastic surgery
I'ma tell you how it is like Ron Burgundy
Yeah, for life, baby, I'm dressed for the war
Baby girl, I'm your soldier
But trippin' like this, back and forth, wonder who gon' hold you (Who's gon')

Yeah, okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch (Yeah)
The dopest dope you smoke, gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth (Damn)

Get my girl angry and pissed and give that pussy a kiss (Damn)
Pushing the same piece of shit until I get me a Bentley
Same niggas, same goals, same dreams and epiphanies (Damn)
Me and my niggas are same lines as symmetry, wasn't empathy (Damn)
Remember we would front yard brawl with big Timothy? (Damn)
Kicked them doors because we had a lot of energy (Damn)
My brother was locked up for shooting at the enemy (Damn)
Caught one nigga then caught fifteen (Damn)
I ain't meet that nigga 'til I was fifteen (Damn)
Now I'm kicking 16's with a big screen in attempt to get the big cream (Damn)
Little guy with a big dream, I need guidance (Damn)
'Cause if I'on succeed, I probably proceed violence (Damn)
Sippin' on the brown, no Bobby, I don't fuck with nobody
No team and no posse, you can catch it like Shockey (Damn)
King of all kings, praise Haile Selassie (Damn)
Rastafari, I don't need nobody, the God's got me (Damn)

Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch (Damn)

Yeah, get that shit how you live
We on a trade for a trade
I do this for you, I do this for you, you know what I mean?
I took the risk, you took the risk, I ain't disrespect it

So part of the reason I be so hard on my people
We never had it easy, never had a pot to pee in
I be on my knees praying till my onomatopoeia's packing a coliseum
Ain't no parking, I gotta see J.I.D
Gotta be there for my family, I gotta, can't try to be
I could be out of my mind, thinking logically
No apologies for speaking how I feel, I silently swore solemnly
That I would be the guy to make my black people proud of me
Roses to the mothers of anybody that doubted me
Yo' chick want dick, bitch dove in the covers
Overseen my areas, surveyed over my brothers
You touch them, you kill me, you can't get close to none of us
They still double-dribble, we going for triple-doubles
Triple up on your investment fuckin' with us
Probably have to rock that vest shit, you fuckin' with us
Wait (Nah bro) Huh? (What you talkin' 'bout, homes?)

Okay, I told motherfuckers I was sick as a bitch (Damn)
The dopest dope you smoke gon' get you a whiff
Watch how these niggas flip the script with the flick of they wrist
Southern lyricists don't exist like my flow is a myth (Damn)
Okay but fuck that shit, I gotta get it, I gotta get 'em
Tired of picking these locks, you don't respect my existence
I used to sleep in my car, never a park or a bench
But damn a nigga was broke, damnit if I didn't get it
Them niggas was thinking that it was just a wrap for the kid
One day they gon' hit my phone, hit the show, scream, clap for the kid
Let's get it poppin', they're pulling pistols on Apostle Paul
So pay the piper or meet the sniper, legend of the fall
I knew in diapers you and I was nothing alike at all
I do or die, you do it to die, I'm really making calls
You couldn't kill it and take it out of me, the ideology
This the Odyssey, I'm Odysseus, you gotta follow me
Watch how I maneuver, I influence the influencers
The flow is like a fluent influenza going through the motion
So I motivate all of my niggas, they tell me kill 'em with kindness
I'd rather kill 'em and they other significants
Writing lyrics in the city with pretty booties and titties
Don't get the cooties, it ain't like the movies
It kinda is 'cause they're shooting, kind of shit is you moving?
Shit I'm pushing, empower the people life where I grew up
Someone tutored the students, these niggas stupidest, stupider, stupid shit
Sick as a bitch, flick of the wrist, my pen cleanse  my many sins
The irony the iron can't straighten out any wrinkle in existence
Ripple in time triple my eyes realistically sick in the mind
Sick in the head?
Wish I was dead, sick on a med, 'dicted
My lead sick 'em, give 'em, send 'em to hell, eh

Radar, sonar, laser beams
Jets, tanks, submarines
Megathons, H-bombs, napalm, ga—

I got the shit you would light with a lighter
Fuck a lighter, I could light on the stove
Dark at night, I'll drop a log on the fire
Wander in the woods out in the cold
I got the shit you could play for your mama
I got the shit you could play for the hoes
I got the shit you could sell to the trappers
In Decatur with the 'K and the Colt
I know some rappers that—how I'ma say this?
I know some rappers who paid but broke
Lotta money but you played your soul
You played yourself, you played the role
I know some niggas from down the street
Some of my niggas been down the road
Lost a nigga that was down with me
You know what they say, it rains, it pours

It rains, it pours
(Ooh, we have a penalty flag thrown at the thirty yard line)
(Personal foul, unsportsman-like conduct, number six on the defense, fifty-) It rains, it pours
It rains, it pours

They got the shit they could pull out
I know it could blow out a back, yeah
They got the cure to the vax'
Facts, you know where it's at
They put the money, the crack in a sack
They got the axis, they got the Atlas, they got the maps
I got a real, real, real bad bitch
I just told her to come to the back (Oh man)
They got the people in office
Them crackers that had us in chains
They make the laws, they goin' hard
Dang, they even started a gang
How you gon' win in a losable game?
Make a change, man, niggas say the same thing
Every day, complain and the sun shine
And the cloud rain, but won't lift a finger
In the danger, niggas been endangered
Been indentured, now my niggas got business ventures
With my .9, I'm like ten Avengers
Snap a finger, I could end adventures
Rapper? Singer? No, killer, nigga
You a cop or you a nigga killer, woah

It rains, it pours
It rains, it pours (Ooh, we have a penalty flag thrown at the thirty-yard line)
(Personal foul, unsportsman-like conduct)
It rains, it pours
(Number 6 on the defense)
It rains, it pours

Man, they won't understand, man (Oh, shit)
And, man, they won't understand, man (Fucked up)
And, man, they won't understand (Uh)
I live in harmony and peace
And the sun will once again rise up in the East (See)

Somebody told me when I was small
That the pride cometh right before the fall
God son died for us all
So for mine, I'm running through a wall
Lost a battle, it's still a war
I'ma steal the cattle, then burn the farm
We could travel but the journey long
I prefer we get a lil' murder on
Drop the top on your convertible
How we feelin' should concern you
We been speakin' but ain't never been heard
So now we screamin' at you word-for-word
Everything a nigga learned gotta burn
My lil' nigga in a hearse, I was hurt
Fuck a rap and fuck a verse, I could blur it
Tryna see how many urns I could earn
Are you entertained or are you concerned?
I'd be afraid, I'd be in church
I'd say a pray, I pray I say, I say I shade
They play like God, no play-by-play
We take our charge, we take our place
It'll take our hearts, it'll take our faith
But we need the majority to make shit shake
I'ma get me a quarter, I'ma get in a car
And I'ma get on a call and go state-by-state
And I'm picking the target then I'm picking them off
You better be Beyoncé if you say my name
Orange ambient sunlight and daylight savings
Might save a nigga's life
It ain't never too bright to broad day a nigga
Night time vampires and they'll slay a nigga
It's not like landslide so you can take their slide
I'm a canine straight in the pack lookin' for Jiddy, he's takin' it back
Crackin' a whip, whippin' the crack
Just like them crackers that did to the blacks
Just like they thought I was finished attacking
A beast awoken, I peel at the crackin'
They inferior and fear when I'm rappin'
But I ain't rappin, this is spiritual
Shed a tear so it'll curate when miracles happen, huh
Mirror, mirror, why the fuck is you laughing?
Dear, dear, let me volunteer 'cause I'm not in fear
I'ma jump in the ashes (Ooh)
Oh shit, ""It's getting weird""
Nah, shit is weird, what the hell is heaven on this hemisphere?
If them bitches sell it, I'ma end it here
If we come together we can send a message
But I know they never gonna land it here
So I got the method, one, do you better
Do you want better?
Bitch, you won't do it, let's bet I will
Collect my stones, ho, collect my gems
Protect my stronghold, respect my shield
Until I'm long gone but while I'm here
I can snap my fingers, they'll disappear (Boom)

Gotta bring it to you cowards, y'all wanted it
Cowards, and it's gonna be sicker than all the niggas–
Yeah, uh, look

You can tell a nigga like me ain't never had shit
R.I.P., I miss my dawgs like Mike Vick
Zombies in that midnight fog, them bars sick 'em
Fall victim to a gun brawl, started over some bitches, huh
Niggas trippin', they takin' whatever's given
The irony when a nigga's starvin', gotta grip the biscuit
Jump the fence, empty all the dishes out your kitchen
If you witness it, then click, click, click, and they spill the grits
Feel the kick, fuck a fair catch, kill 'em, who tryna take the hit?
First take go to first base, Stephen A. Smith Wess'
On the hip, talkin' shit like Skip
Or Shannon, sharp-shootin' off the top of the cliff
And if I gotta bring it to you cowards then it's gonna be sick
Put in my ten thousand hours while the clock still ticks
Zone-6, five fingers with the ""Suck my dick""
Me and Izzy was slap-boxin', nigga bust my lip
Start fightin', lil' brother on some tough guy shit
But if you ever did me wrong, he on some ""What's right?"" shit
Bust a left, feel the pressure like the bus pipe drip
Blood red, rum sippin', they ain't cut like this, momma said
You might also like
""When you fall down, stand up, get a bandage""
""I ain't got cheeseburger money, make a sandwich""
""Why you bein' bad? See ya dad, get your ass whipped""
Seven crackhead bad kids in a caravan

Somebody involved in stealin', it's on, it wasn't
It's gon' be so bad
When the girl went off on Precious
The girl went off on Precious, Rosalyn went in
No, Rosalyn said, ""Oh, for real, I'll see you when you get outside""
Exactly, exactly
That's okay, my fault, my fault, my fault
For real? No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Look, uh

You can tell a nigga like me ain't met a nigga like me
Metaphysical things seen in dreams, what you believe?
You believe I bleed, then draw blood
I'm a fuckin' artiste, Artest with the gun
I can give my world peace, give your world ether
Big dick or grief, I can give your girl either
She could be the, could be the collapse of a kingdom
But king's gotta peep the seat, word to Caesar
Remind me to keep receipts, y'all shit weak
I ain't worried that that bullshit leaked
See the volumes, it speaks to your broke speakers
Niggas breakin' they back tryna promote some shit that ain't even dope
They ask for my coat when I walk through the door
God flow, I don't walk on the floor
God knows y'all hoes, y'all shows ain't packin' the door
Crackin' the floor, I don't even know if niggas rappin' no more, come on (Uh okay)
'Round in my city, I am my shooter
Mindin' my business, I am not you
'Round in my city, I am my shooter
Mindin' my business, I am not you
'Round in my city, I am my shooter
Mindin' my business, I am not you
'Round in my city, I am my shooter
Mindin' my business, how about you?

Look, uh, I do it for Royal and Rosalyn, Rachel and Carl
Izzy, Precious, Destin, strong seven kids, different blessings (Hey)
Izzy athletic as fuck, All-American star, hard head
Scholarship at a school in New Orleans
On the football shit, but in class, he on the smart shit (Hey)
Black man using his mind, it's a target on your forehead
Gotta stay on point like a marksman
Make a mark, leave a footprint, went for a marching
Bro graduating so we heading to the blue state
Fam' celebrating, granny cooking up a few cakes
Yeah, gown on with the cap like a toupee
Handed a diploma, all the Routes say, ""Hooray""
Yeah, hooray, today, catch a bouquet
Tonight it probably be a movie, what's a Blu-Ray?
I got some new Js and a fade, we hit the section
With the football team and a couple other professionals
It sound cool but really, this a confessional (Hey)
Twenty minutes in it, Precious and 'nem went to the restroom
Said they got to hittin' with some women and they 'bout to get kicked out
They ain't even tell us what that shit was about
All I really seen from the big VIP couch
Was a nigga swing, and hit my sister right in the mouth
The bouncer tried to block the door, that way we couldn't get out
But fuck that, the whole team bust that motherfucker down
Now we fighting in the street, it's like ten against twenty-three
I was seventeen, swinging on any and everything
Bing, bing, see my brother doing buddy like a boxing ring
Ros' got a bitch doing the hair weave sling
So beautiful, beating ass was like a family thing
Fighting together made us tighter in spite of how we would argue and scream
And now we brawling right outside of a party in New Orleans
And all the people start police-calling
Pack us inside of a paddy wagon, we sardines
To Saltine crackers that wanna shackle us in chains (Hey)
Lo and behold, they held us in a holding cell for six
Or maybe seven hours just to let us go without a stain
But who's to blame when all of us got the same mind frame?
We like a gang, mom and pop'll probably be proud and ashamed
Pound for pound, my sister Precious never lost a fade
Got up off the ground and she said she could hear my father sayin'
""When you fall down, stand up, get the bandage""
""I ain't got cheeseburger money, make a sandwich""
""Why you bein' bad? See ya dad, get your ass whipped""
Seven crackhead bad kids in a caravan, yeah

Hold on, hold on, hold on
What happened? What happened? What happened?
We came in the club
We're talking, we go in the restroom
I go in the bathroom, open the door
""Dang B, you could've said sorry""
Ros' said, ""B, you ain't gotta say all that, it ain't that serious""
And she was all, ""Oh, it's that serious because you were in the bathroom""
Ros' said, ""Okay B, I got you B, come outside""
Taj, she opened the door, Rosalyn said ""Roof""
I said, ""Okay, we fighting""
Damn, she was in the stall
Oh the stall door
Yeah, she was peeing, girl, she pulled her pants up
She opened the door and received it (Rosalyn met her)

Cole, you stupid

Look, you told me never let this get a hold of me
You hate to see me hurt, you wanna hurt someone for me
Way too down to Earth, don't do no dirt for me, please
I don't need nobody else takin' a deal or a plea
God knowin' what I'm doin', he gon' deal with me
Niggas ain't cut like that, she'll kill for me
And I don't care if we don't speak for like a million weeks
You right there when I need you but I know these ain't your kind of people
I finally bought a home to raise my family
I'm done with all the hoes and they anatomiеs
I tried to call your phone again, you said, ""It wasn't on""
And by the timе you got my letter, I was long gone

Back on the road, gone with the wind blows
Packin' the shows, hoes and the nymphos, platinum and gold
You know how this shit go when family's gone
You don't know what you here for, uh

Just remember, remember who I am
Mommies, daughters, models, callers
Ballers, fathers, all have fallen
Mommies, daughters, models, callers
Ballers, fathers, all have fallen
You might also like
Look, you said I shouldn't worry 'bout the fame
You seem to be concerned of what you heard about the game
'Cause soon as niggas get a little change, niggas change
And playin' with the Lord's name, sayin' it in vain
You heard this song and said I did the same thing
You seein' somethin' different in my eyes, and she emphasized
And I ain't get it at the time, I couldn't listen
Had to call her back, line packed, sold out tickets
I'm on the wrong track, road back, fuck it, I'm hittin' it
On the road, I'ma bulldoze the globe for the dough
She know she happy that we doin' better than before
As long as I'm sellin' shows, you ain't sellin' for your soul
I felt like she was yellin' like Azealia in that megaphone
Said, ""I'ma hit you in the mornin', keep your message on""
I did my set then sat alone for a second by myself
Asked questions, choices, destination, courses
Highways, routes, Royces rollin' voices
Goin' on and on and on, it's noisy
I'm not the only one affected by the poison in the mind
And the lifestyle that shine from the iced-out diamonds
That combine with misogynistic mindsets
Dialect from slave, diatribe, they tryna dissect to re-digest
I tossed that mindset overboard like an object
I'm tryna find a letter to the Lord from the projects
'Cause when I was a boy, I didn't know that we was poor
And now I'm on tour, I got a moment to explore
And show my niggas somethin' we ain't never seen before
Open doors, so you know I'm goin'
Back on the road, gone with the wind blows
Packin' the shows, hoes and the nymphos, platinum and gold
You know how this shit go when family's gone
You don't know what you here for, uh

Just remember, remember who I am
Mommies, daughters, models, callers
Ballers, fathers, all have fallen
Mommies, daughters, models, callers
Ballers, fathers, all have fallen

Why do I get so damn high that I can't feel my face?
Try and try to free my mind, but I can't find a way
Why do I get so damn high that I can't feel my face?
Try and try to free my mind, but I can't find a way

Look, I never gave that much a fuck about this shit
To let it challenge my integrity
But you questionin' me, got me thinkin' you thinkin' less of me
The lesson in this shit is we should talk face to face, fuck the messagin'
Meet me in the flesh and you can see that I'm still lil' Destin
Lil' brubbie, lil' BB, bald head as a baby in the Huggies
Stunt like my dad, I'm a druggie
Money in my hands but it's bloody
Try to understand if you love me, ayy
Make plans, we can roll like the old days
FaceTime call came with a stone-cold face
We don't talk often, when we do, it's an, ""Are you okay?""
Somebody fuckin' with you? I'm on the way
It's on the waist, I can tell the way you look, that ain't the case
Figured you was mad at me when you said you need a break from the family
And you not participatin' in no Pagan holiday gatherings
And ever since I start rappin', I ain't never in Atlanta too long
And I hate havin' to only see the family when somethin' bad happen
Like when Granny passed, I ain't wanna answer the phone
Writin' in my pad, hope I don't remember this wrong
Last time I seen you, we was sendin' her home
October, November, December was gone
But on the 25th, we gotta be there for mom
I'm talkin' to you now, but can I see you tomorrow?
I could be on the way soon as I finish this song
So you can see I'm still true in everything that I been doin'
And I don't fuck with the Devil but I know he pursuin'
And I know that Jesus died, thirty-three, like Ewing
And he prolly did the same shit that we like doin'
I know you got to feel the animosity brewin'
It's gettin' bad and I'm sad our relationship ruined over some trash, but it's past that
Send me all the money that I gave you over Cashapp back since you actin' as if you—
We're sorry, you have reached a number that is— (Aw)
That's fucked up (That's fucked, that's fucked, man, that's right)4Embed",https://images.genius.com/0833ddfa5a1d200227e80a3b1f88c16a.1000x1000x1.jpg

I been so down on my luck and stuff ain't lookin' up

And maybe I'm outta touch in a rush
And life been kickin' my butt but that ignited the fire

How you gon' dump me and then leave wit' my hoodie?
And you ain't comin' back, give me back my hoodie
And now you tryna make a scene at the movies
You really wanna act, bitch, we at the movies
I want my money back, I'm leavin' for goodie
And I get aggy, don't even wanna be here
And you get mad 'cause you don't even wanna leave here
And now it's bad 'cause we ain't even seen the previews
And now she mad, takin' shit to social media
And I just need you to tell me how you feelin'
And I just need you to come at me wit' real shit
Botherin' people 'cause we fightin' in the dark, yeah
We ain’t gotta leave but we gon' sit a seat apart (Yeah)
Uh, tears in the bucket of fuck-its
Fightin' and fuckin' and tusslin' and fightin' and fuckin'
Lovin', lovin' unless you lucky
I fuck wit' you because you real and you beautiful
But still, starin' at the screen only thinkin' how I feel
For real
I wanna share my popcorn wit' you
'Cause I won't eat the whole thing
But you still got an issue
And I been tryna sip yo' drink, meet the kid in the middle
But naw, movie over, she just goes to the car
Pull off, she drove, didn't open the door
So cold, outside

He, wait, who after me, huh? (Huh?)
Wait, don't actually explain nothin', I don't wanna know

Our offense is awesome, our defense dominate
We got that winning combination
To what? To regulate
Offense is awesome (Forever)
Yeah

2007, Cole dropped The Come Up
I was in high school playin' corner
I never dreamt of mumblin' words in front of hundreds
Studyin' plays all summer
I'll hit the league if my growth spurt come in, on my mom
2009, bro dropped The Warm Up
I was in warm-ups playin' Weezy
And Yukimi, Little Dragon, flame breathin' the weed
Patrick had the studio dorm room next to me
I freestyled ovеr his beats
My nigga Keese transferrеd in from Tennessee
He's a receiver, I played DB like Aqib
Snatch a nigga chain, Talib
Talib Kweli, I could be lyrically, but I put on cleats
Scribbled lines goin' through my mind like a paper piece
While I covered three, playin' nickel, doin' safety reads, watch the flats
I can rap, but I rather tackle and pedal back
Get a pick when my growth spurt hit (It don't matter 'bout the size, it's in here, man)
I'ma be captain, and I was around 2010, no cap
I got 'Freshman Player of the Year' and figured I was on track
This nigga Pat' been in my ear talkin' 'bout rhymin' on tracks
So after practice we record and then we got it on wax
And on campus I heard about a couple rappers from Atlanta (Earthgang!)
Said them niggas was snappin', maybe we could make somethin' happen and shit
I wasn't serious enough to even be curious
And we lose like every game, so every day I be furious
So, the spirit of a nigga had changed
To the point I had to reframe and focus my skills for other things
I took the steel wheel, I'm steerin' in other lanes
But my fuel on low and my oil need to be changed
Amongst all the other shit that's goin' in my brain
My brother got out of jail, I only know him by name
He did a nickel and a dime in time, probably be stayin' with my mom
And dad probably get mad, actin' lame some times
You might also like
Uh, look
The Sideline Story came out September of 2011
Ib said around that time:
We was huntin' for a record, under lots of pressure
Just combine the leverage with a better effort
You could find a sound to get us out the underground forever
Maybe you can bless a little brown effervescent kid
Youngest of seven from the six, eight sections
Section.80 dropped, yeah, we used to play that shit to death
And if I recollect correct, you tried to sign him for yourself
All the while I was round my out of  town college, wildin' out
Restaurants, Destin dinin', dashin', call it dinin' out
Fuckin' bitches, 'posed to be in class, but I was hiding out
My friends take a little shot, smoke a lot of cannabis, coolest nigga on the campus
Now a nigga skippin' practices, and actin' like a rock star
Going from in the dorm to in the car, leavin' the football field
But fuck that, we still sorry, and the problems from the home front
On my home screen callin' me, I don't wanna answer
My brother Carl hit me, said my granny had cancer
I'm 'posed to graduate and make my way back to Atlanta
No job, no money or nothin' from ballin'
Because between that and school, that was really all
And maybe here's the back that broke the camel with the straw
I wasn't on camera with them amateurs that they saw
But they said they still caught me and my dawgs stealin' boxes
Like Craig on his day off
Called us in the office day before we 'posed to walk, uh
Called a squad car, a couple officers
I know bro was finna tell, he was lookin' nauseous
Now I'm sittin' in a cell, nigga double crossed us
Crossed me off the list for scholarship because I lost it
No more football, my red-shirt senior season, exhausted, so I'm off it
And I'm right back in Atlanta with a half a gram of weed
And a gold Pontiac that my granny had bought for me
I was sleepin' in the back, my dad kicked me in the streets
When he saw my neck tatted, then I told him I was rappin'
Fuck school, no goin' back, he said
If I can not follow his rules, just go and pack
Told you he be actin' lame some times
This my son, he came from these nuts
This negro come back from school
All tatted up like the Sistine Chapel
Talkin' 'bout he ain't playin' football no more
Because he know he ain't goin' pro (Hey, it's a stamina that you left the house with)
But he left on a full scholarship to go to school and get a degree
Because we taught education was the number one thing
Anyway (Every one of you gon' be like your oldest brother)
He came back, determined to do what he was determined to do
And I know because he, he is, who he is, we taught him
Hey, whatever you do, put your full self into it
So he did that, anyway (Do it your best, damn what other people want)
He's back home, I ain't with that
So I'm sayin' ""Hey, you got to go to work""
And he sayin' ""Hey, this is my job, what I'm about to do""
So I'm like ""Hey man, some times you got to work (Or don't be a partner)
To do what you really wanna do""
We went through this whole brain wrestle
But anyway, he won (I'm standing by you)
He decided that ""Hey dad, I'm puttin' this thing, I'm doin' this
This is my job"" and he committed to it
And hey, the rest is history (You can do anything that you want to do)
I'm lookin' at him, I believe in him
I know what was in him
All him and his brothers and sisters
They all got the same mindset
Do your best, give a hundred percent or don't do it at all
So, I know whatever he put his all into, it was gon' be golden
Anyway
Look
March 10th, 2017, The Never Story dropped
And I'm comin' off of tour with ****
That was three years after openin' up for Ab-Soul
But it's EARTHGANG's set, I only came to do a song
DoeBurger used to say ""Ayy bro, this lil' nigga cold
Keep on doin' what you doin', you gon' make it, you 'gon blow""
I ain't know that Ced had went ahead and played my shit for Cole
But I knew he knew the game, and he pulled up to his show
And then that's where we first met, but I ain't think of it no more
'Til Ced Brown said that I should open up for Omen on my own shit, if I wanted
Only four cities, maybe we get Rob Gibbs on the phonin', I got to hone in
In the game grown men uncomfortable in they own skin
But all I wanted was a chance
It feel like I'm in a mannequin challenge
Still stance, but I'm still standin'
'Til my nigga lend a hand and I'm no longer stranded
Lookin' for strengths in the streets of East Atlanta
Momma said ""Don't take advice, they gon' try and take advantage""
I was 'bout to sign with Coach K, I ain't take the advance
Cole say ""Hold on, wait, bro, I got the plan
So come on, damn, lil nigga, come on, shit, let's roll, fuck""

Shsh, yo, that's crazy
That's crazy, yo JID, I remember
I remember you came to the crib
You remember this? After we had met
And I told you and EARTHGANG to pull up
To the crib in Carolina, it's the studio house
I wasn't on no shit, like ""Yo, I'm tryna do some Dreamville shit with y'all"", nah
It wasn't no talk of no deal, I didn't even know if I wanted to sign niggas
I just knew I, y'all was dope, I fuck with you
Just pull up, let's see what the vibe is like, let's work
In my mind, if something happen, it happen
If not, then cool, niggas just got a chance to link and kick it
But while we was there, the thing that I noticed off rip
I said, ""Oh, this nigga want it, this nigga really want it""
That look in your eye, nigga, I know that look
I know that look too well
But a lot of niggas want it
The thing I noticed about you my nigga, off rip
""This nigga don't just want it, he willin' to do the work that it takes to get it""
And that's the difference, that's the separator
That's the difference between the niggas that never get what they want
And the niggas whose names ring out forever

Oh, woah, woah, woah

Baby girl, have faith in a nigga without a job
And let a nigga stay at your place
Play it for your friends when I drop a mixtape
Both of us will win if I get a big break
Broke nigga dick? Baby, had a long day
Tryna get rich, buy you Dolce
And Gabbana, baby, just be honest
Don't be tryna play me, I'm an artist, baby, I'm an artist
Baby, I'm an artist (And I'm sensitive about my shit)
I been tryna make it on my grind, I'm takin' what is mine
I'm racin' with the time
I been tryna make it at my hardest, makin' it a promise
Chasin' with my heart in it
I just gotta make it to the stars, a spaceship or a rocket
Paintin', I'm an artist
I'm just tryna make it as an artist (And I'm sensitive about my shit)
I just gotta make it

Heavy way to hold the head and notice
Just a long and cold and scary
But I don't even feel a thing no more
I set my goals and I'm preparеd (Look-look-look-look-look, uh)
Will you be there? (Look, uh)

Evеrybody wanna come and hang with the stars

A hundred miles an hour on the way to Lee-R
You don't even believe in Jesus wearin' Christian Dior
You crazy on a Twitter, who we need for PR?
You out of control, P-O-W-E-R
Went to the head and now you doin' bodily harm
On the meds and nobody wanna say
Because they scared to lose a gig
But yeah-yeah, you wanna be JID, kid
I used to wanna be Jay, I used to wanna be Wayne
I used to wanna be Kanye and Andre 3K
And all my homegirls wanted to be Beyoncé
Can you pay my telephone bills?
Woah, shit, I was just lookin' for a deal
Workin' so hard, had to sharpen my skills
Work with my dawgs, still sharpen my steel
Was still in apartments, stealin' and starvin'
Fast-forward, I'm in a buildin' with stars
And I got in Yachty car, he got stars in the ceilin'
Pause for a minute (Wait)
Gotta know the difference in the stars and the gimmicks
Are you really in it for the arts or the image?
Do you really live it in your heart and spirit?
It's part of all you are, and all you isn't
Heavy way to hold the head and notice (Trust your vision)
Just a long and cold and scary (Trust your vision)
But I don't even feel a thing no more
I set my goals and I'm prepared
Will you be there?


And now, a word from our ancestors
Man, I, I like these new slaves

Your chain hangin', bling swingin', back breakin'
But it's gleamin', problem posture, double cup leanin'
Slide, slouchin' tiger, pimpin' dragon on swagger
VVS is very vertebrae snappin', lights flashin'
A manicured appearance concealin' the shattered spirit
Jinn sneerin' out the paradox prism
The palace as the prison, retail religion
Red carpet constriction, the freedom is the fiction
As niggas raised specific is race really existin'
Man, get the bag, you're trippin'
Go 'head partner, hit this, sip this
Wishlist, hitlist, top ten, shit list, bitchless
Chickless, playmate, playboy, flip sides, same coin, big front

No relation to class of Osiris
Kissin' cousins 'til the climbin' gas prices kill a climate
Yikes-es, sucker, mean muggin', who the nicest?

Always thinkin', ""Why my lips so big?
Was I too dark? Can they sense my fears?""
These gay thoughts would always haunt me
I prayed God would take it from me
It's hard for you when you're fightin'
And nobody knows it when you're silent
I'd be by the phone
Stanning Nicki mornin' into dawn
Only place I felt like I belonged

I only see you in your halo

But we no longer sing the same notes

Hello, old friend from the road
I wanted to write a note
To let you know that all in all, it ain't all what it seems
I feel like I've hit a low
One I've never hit before
Lately, I've been feeling small as the salt in the sea
Oh, it's so much to do in so little of time
I feel like I fell a little behind
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
It seems so out of reach
The place I want to be
Whoever thought I'd get there anyway?
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go

Oh, Blue, I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue, I love you, too
But today, I'm gonna run away from home

Oh, I weep through the night
Can't find a love who loves me the same
Or as much as you do
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
Oh, I reach out my hand hoping that they'll see
I'm more than what everyone tells me
Hodo, Hodo, Hodo
See, I'm getting tired of the way I've been living
I'd rather die than to live with these feelings
Stuck in this world where there's so much to prove
Every win gives you more room to lose
It's too many ups and downs on the ride
I spent inordinate 'mounts of time
Trapped in a lonely, loner life
Looking for love where I'm denied

I find it hard to get
Way too hard to live
Tell me what you know
Now before I go

Oh, Blue, I wrote for you
To say I'm gonna run away from home
Oh, Blue, I love you, too
But today, I'm gonna run away from home

Life sucks and I never tried suicide
Mind's fucked even more than I realise
Time's up, keep it moving when she arrives
If you ever heard what I heard in my mind
Never try, you would cry, that's a lie, you would die
I don't wanna ever come down from a high
I'm in the best seat, from time, been a next breed
If you comin', come at me directly
Don't need no one to defend me
Soul's in a place even I can't get to, don't fuck with the deadly
Moon waves and open seas, quick coasting overseas
Fuck those who don't believe
They will never wanna admit I'm the best here
From the mere fact that I've got ovaries
It's a woman's world, so to speak
Pussy, you sour
Never givin' credit where it's due 'cause you don't like pussy in power

My, my, if you've ever heard what I've heard in the night
What a fright, must've been a parasite in my past life
I don't wanna ever come down from a high
My soul ascended to the sky, it's just you and I
God but I'm feelin' too alive
Tryna get me out of spite
Someone's gotta pay, I ain't talkin' big amounts
Some kind of physical pain
Some kind of traumatic shit
Niggas wanna see dead bodies
Probably not, they ain't rollin'
With no automatic clips
Moving scatty, all erratic and shit
Niggas pussy lickin', batty and shit
Oh, you mad? Then come at me, you prick
Make a move, better pattern it quick
I assume you'll be comin' for blood

Not a word, you will listen when my soul speaks
Down I go, so follow me, follow me, follow me
Actually, don't follow me, nobody bother me
I'm a mess, honestly, fuck all of your policies
They wanna kick me down and demolish me
Use me and fuckin' abolish me
I don't wanna hear no apologies
Or am I in my own head?
Can't tell anymore, psychotic to the death
When I dig deep, I can never find nothin' left
It's a mystery
Rage, nothin' but rage
Can't figure out if I'm goin' insane
Ain't no doubt we'll be showing no mercy
So think twice if you wanna get blazed
Nothin' ain't nice 'round here, no games

There's a war, there's a war

The kingdom's on fire, the blood of a young messiah
I see sinners in a church, I see sinners in a church
Sometimes I might be introvert
There's a war inside, I hear battle cries
Mothers burying sons, young boys playing with guns
The devil's a liar, fulfil your wildest desires
Now I don't wanna be the one to doctor this
But if you can't feel pain, then you can't feel the opposite
The fight between the Yin and Yang's a fight you'll never win
I study humans, that makes me an anthropologist
I'm not into politics, but I know it's dark times
Parts of the world still living in apartheid (Thеre's a war, there's a war)
But if I don't takе this winner's flight, that's career suicide
Though I should've been a friend when your grandma died
I see the illness eat my aunt laying in her bed
I see her soul rising as her body gets closer to death

Find a way, I'll find a way
The world's not over
I will make it, don't you cry
In God we trust
'Cause we're not alone
You might also like
I need a licence to feel
Internal wounds and I'm not tryna be healed (No, I don't, no, I don't)
I sabotage what we are trying to build
'Cause of feelings I keep inside, but it's time to reveal (Reveal, reveal)
I hate the thought of just being a burden
I hate that these conversations are surfaced
Simz the artist or Simbi the person?
To you I'm smiling, but really, I'm hurting
I dedicate my life and gave my heart over twenty-something years
Left wondering how I even feel
But was it even worth it?
I bottle up and then spill it in verses
One day, I'm wordless, next day, I'm a wordsmith
Close to success, but to happiness, I'm the furthest
At night, I wonder if my tears will dry on their own
Hoping I will fulfil Amy's purpose
Angel said, ""Don't let you ego be a disturbance""
Inner demon said, ""Motherfucker, you earned this""
Like they strip you of everything you're deserving
Realise there is a prison in us, we are conditioned as fuck
Man, it's like they can't sleep till our spirit is crushed
How much fighting must we do? We've been fearless enough
All we seen is broken homes here and poverty
Corrupt government officials, lies, and atrocities
How they talking on what's threatening the economy?
Knocking down communities to re-up on properties
I'm directly affected, it does more than just bother me
Look beyond the surface, don't just see what you wanna see
My speech ain't involuntary
Projecting intentions straight from my lungs
I'm a Black woman and I'm a proud one
We walk in blind faith not knowing the outcome
But as long as we're unified, then we've already won
Find a way, I'll find a way
The world's not over
I will make it, don't you cry
In God we trust
'Cause we're not alone

Sometimes I can be introvert
Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert
Introvert
Feels like, feels like, feels like I can be introvert
Sometimes I can be introvert
And so it begins
The base is an amalgamation of everything
Rules are not to be played by rebels
The story of never-ending
Your introversion led you here
Intuition protected you along the way
Feelings allowed you to be well balanced
And perspective gave you foresight
The top of the mountain is nothing without the climb
Only the strong will survive
Only the strong (Will survive)
Alone, but not lonely
Your truth unveils with time
As you embark on a journey
Of what it takes to be a woman34Embed",https://images.genius.com/82967dab7e5483f2cdfb659e7b29a4e5.1000x1000x1.jpg

Oh
All my life been a black sheep
All my life been the black keys
True I never really was a bad breed
Daddy probably rather me an athlete
Man that nigga move like a taxi
All my life in the backseat
You talk about life is it that sweet?
All these eyes staring at me

I've been feeling real low nigga, lowkey (lowkey)
How a brave heart feeling so weak? (so weak)
Tattoos on my passport, no sleep (no sleep)
This is what you asked for don't weep
Don't winge, man I'm here and I won't leave
All I wanna do, make songs, blow trees
Wouldn't be honest with myself if I don't speak
So I make the point to address 'em man you know me (hey)
Got me believing in Buddha the more I proceed (yuh)
Oh this life isn't guaranteed (yuh)
All my life felt a cold breeze
In and out but staying up and never down, you hearing me now?
Give me some time and a little space, I'll figure it out
They wanna know my whereabouts, and who I'm around
Been in wonderland for time, tryna' find our way out
You can hear it my rhymes, I'll be thinking aloud
I'ma be ghost for a minute don't get in your feelings
I ain't even wrote for a minute, not a single lyric
Man I got a life that is crazy most cannot live it
See 'em tryna' sabotage me, got me fucking livid

All I hear 'em saying is look what you've become
This is what you signed up, before you forget
This is what you get, uh, this is what you get

All these eyes in the front row, hella' pure souls in the front row
Remember seeing J Cole I was in the front row
Couldn't move, was in awe if you must know
Still struggling to find who I trust though
All my life in the cut though (yuh)
All my life caught the bus home, through the north side
Then I got a pedal bike, mommy flipped when I got home
Like, people get, killed out here but mummy I'm a rider and a fighter
Never been a dickhead in life, don't ever try me
Don't get it confused 'cause I'm humble and I'm quiet
Loud niggas step into Simz and get silenced
I ain't gotta say how but it don't involve violence
Though I got Gs that are already in the hair for it
But there's no need, I just want peace
Take me higher, get an eight from the supplier
Make your mind up, what you mean? What you desire?
Niggas hating but it's cool man, it's a minor
I just do me on my own and I'm the driver
Twenty-three feeling older and I'm wiser
All my life been searched for what I'd die for
Guess I am the one, the people I'ma fight for
Surely you should know who you rep, who you ride for

Yoruba girl tougher than imperial leather
He was gettin' bitter while she was gettin' better
Diamonds are forever
Miss Sierra Leone, lookin' like a gem
Works hard in the week, party on the weekend
Know you wanna live with no one watchin' how you spend
Got a thing for the finer things and the finer men, hm
Miss Tanzania, she a do or die
Say she want to know more 'bout the Sukuma tribe
We hit the zoot, once wasn't enough
Got an ocean full of knowledge, you could scuba dive
Miss Ethiopia can play so jazzy
Then sit you down and school you on Selassie

Tell 'em you're nothin' without a woman, no
Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow
Tell 'em what's up

I love how you go from zero to one hundred
And leave the dust behind, you've got this
All action, no talk

When you have beauty and brains, they find it astoundin'

Self made, ain't nobody doin' gold digger
Now, Miss India always speaks with her chest
Got respect from her people 'cause she leads them the best
Hm, real life queen in the flesh
Know the crown get heavy, still it be's on your head
Brooklyn ladies, know you hustle on the daily
Innovative just like Donna Summer in the eighties
Your time, they seein' you glow now
Intelligence and elegance, show 'em how
Miss Jamaica understand food for the soul
She get up in the kitchen know she throw down

Ain't nothin' without a woman, no
Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow
Tell 'em what's up

I love how you go from zero to one hundred
And leave the dust behind, you've got this
All action, no talk
I see you glow, you're the finest gold
When you walk in the room, they feel your soul
Our style, it shines, so ahead of time
And you know that you're fire, you're so damn fine, girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl
Girl, girl, girl, girl

She a Ghana girl
Calm with it, never let the marijuana fail
Though a sucker for the romance, take you to the homeland
One way, she ain't comin' back, nah

Time's up, tell the people that we comin', yeah, yeah
Done bein' in the shadow, goin' public, yeah, yeah
Don't know how to bear it, how to stomach, yeah, yeah
Hand over the shit and let us run it, yeah, yeah
All we know is lookin' flawless, all they know is stare, stare

Ain't nothin' without a woman, though
Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow (Glow, glow)

I love how you go from zero to one hundred
And leave the dust behind, you've got this
And lead them with your light
You've got this (Woman to woman, I just wanna see you glow)
All action, no talk (Tell 'em what's up)
You know, Simbi
Sometimes, you know, I just look around
And I just think of all the things we've gone through
All the great things in life and all the horrible things that are just the other half of the great things in life
And how you don't really get greatness without sacrifice
And you don't get good things without a little bit of pain
And how happiness is the substitute for the emptiness that you can sometimes feel on the other side
I dunno, it just reminds me to call you
But then you never pick up the phone!10Embed",https://images.genius.com/82967dab7e5483f2cdfb659e7b29a4e5.1000x1000x1.jpg

But still, nah, they don't wanna give no props, but life's good when you make this much dough

We all have our demons
Our thoughts, our imperfections and our insecurities
None of which make us inhumane
This is our tale
The proton, the neutron and the electron
The positive, the negative and the ground
The trial, the person and the story of
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Prolly not

Real dark in the cemetery
Where the souls lie, oh my
What've I become, man, I’m so high
Quit killing my buzz
Love drunk in the maze like: ""What have you done?
Where the hell are you taking me?
What are we running from?""
Demons in the back of my closet, don’t talk to them
You wouldn’t want to be me, 'cuz I’ve walked with them
And it wasn’t a nice walk: traumatised
Left me in a bad head space
Lookin' to Heaven’s door, I've been saved, or have I?
Asked for forgiveness, can I or will I?
Negative at heart, am I?
Or shall I explain what the world done to me?
You wouldn’t understand what I been through fully
And these dark thoughts never been new to me
And nobody lovin' me; everybody through with me
Everybody lookin' at me different
And nobody’ll listen
I can see you starin' at me: what do you envision?
No faith in me, should I resort to religion?
But even, I could never change the life I’m livin'
I’m a druggie, I’m a fiend
Neva' been clean
Soul’s always been tainted
Homeless: what'chu know about livin' on the street?
Cold nights, you know, right? Nothin' to eat
Figured that you wouldn't give me money anyways
Even though I hear the coins rattlin' in your jeans
I ain’t even beggin' no more
Fuck it! Maybe I’ll just beg a little more
But don’t judge me
God above me, why do you have me livin' like a junkie?
Fuck, man
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Prolly not
Dark clouds, nigga, fuck a rainbow
Nobody talk until I say so
I just might sell my soul, if it’s worth anything
But we’ll see how the day goes
You might also like
I just might sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Will anybody miss me?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not
I'mma sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not

Ooh, mind’s on overload!
Hit straight to the face, might overdose!
This ain’t the life I chose: what would you know?
This ain’t the beginning: I ain’t even come close
Bare robbing, activity indulge
Is it very human? I don’t think I have a pulse
Blacked out in the night, nigga
Devil on both shoulders: ain't no motherfuckin' angel to my right, nigga!
Have you ever seen a grown man cry? Never me
Shit, I need that nicotine
Heals me like medicine
Gotta be aware all times
Better be dogs out here
Lookin' for a different pedigree
Know you see it
Never get too comfy
Me nuh' trust nobody
Feds always wanna roll on me
I ain’t done nuttin', I’m so sorry
You can take time, no hurry
Even though that I ain’t slept for days
My body’s aching, but my mind’s awake
Shit, the flow is crazy, I should rhyme for change
Oh, dear lady, gimme the time of day
See you a mile away
I can never own up to my mistakes
Perhaps, it’ll take me to a higher state
No escape, I’m tryin' to find a way
I’m the one that you was tryna save
Please, give up, you don’t have time to waste
This is real, I’ve been waitin' my whole life to feel
Do you wanna see a dead body? No chill
I just might sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Will anybody miss me?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not

Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?

This is my story, wait, nah
This is our story, this is our fate
This is our kingdom, this is our place
This is our freedom, cut off them chains
This is our struggle, this is our pain
This is our love, this is our trust
This is our daughters, this is our sons
Give me back my wings, yeah
Oh
Give me back my wings, see, I just wanna fly again
Wanna try, fail, try to try again
Head up in the stars, I promise I'm higher then
The right person for the job, you hire then fire them
I be working for the same thing, towards the same goal
Are we losing the passion in which we came for?
I was strong but identifying the same flaws
Fighting each other but battling for the same cause, let me breathe
Ain't got the time to be your enemy
That shit is draining, they're taking up too much energy
I'd rather invest in something that's worth it, the time is precious
So for Simz to waste it is something you'll never see, hold me to it
Everything is just a memory
It's getting modest then and never modest then, then I remember
I am not fucking about, getting modest is an error
I'll be fine as long as I've got my head up (breathe!)
I ain't prayed in a minute
Before you judge me, hold that thought and let me finish
For a long time I thought that praying was just asking for things
Like the road to riches and diamond rings
But now I know that I just gotta be thankful
Blessings every day, shit, I've got my hands full
Lessons every day, I'm learning for more angles
Mum, stop stressing over shit that I'mma handle, don't you know?
Simbi got you, I ain't even gotta say it
The album's here, I hope you love it, hope you play it
I know you knew this day would come, I know you prayed it
Can't wait to look at you and tell you that I made it
It's amazing
Good things come to the people that wait and I waited
Tell me, do you believe the quote above I stated?
Nobody handed me a dream, I had to chase it
I had to be business-minded and put aside my feelings
I had to find my own truth, my own meanings
Wrote this in the same bedroom I started in
Had to dream big, had to look beyond my ceiling
Do you feel it?
Hand on my heart, if only you could feel the way it's beating
I mean it
This the type of music that ain't never gonna sell? Well
Shouldn't never ever tell me that
Should've never ever told me that
What if I prove you wrong? Tell me know, could you live with that?
No, you wouldn't wanna live that
I ain't saying this'll go to number one, oh, I ain't saying that
I know you know that I ain't saying that
I just wanna do this all for my people, fuck the rest
Give you realness every time, nothing more, nothing less, and it goes like
No time for these low-lives
I'm onto something bigger all thanks to the most high
Becoming more relentless and less defensive, it's in my mechanism
Who give a fucks about cosigns?
Never scared of killing 'em, something that's too real
They don't have to play this, I know that Huw will, and you will
No, you can't ignore it
Many of us want this life but just ain't cut out for it, yeah
So don't you ever
Forget who told you this
No, don't you ever
See, this is for your kids
Yeah, don't you ever
Overlook this here
So this is our message, this is our faith
This is our voice, this is our names
This is our new, now we want change
This is our sun, this is our rain
This is our win, this is our fail
This is our hands, how can we help?
This is our heaven, this is our hell
This is our story, this is our tale, our taleYou might also like2Embed",https://images.genius.com/82967dab7e5483f2cdfb659e7b29a4e5.1000x1000x1.jpg

I love you
I hate you
I love you
I hate you
I love you

So much, I would give my life for this (I hate you)
If the bullet was the beat, I would probably die for this (I love you)
How many times did I cry for this? (I hate you)
I would hate myself if I didn't at least try for this (I love you)
What's at stake is bigger than me
Blood, tears, how it stains, can't rid it with ease (I hate you)
What we have in common is our pain, we're given the keys  (I love you)
To unlock what it takes to fight for what we believe in (I hate you)
Hard to confront the truth of what you see in thе mirror (I love you)
Some peoplе you inspire and others you trigger (I hate you)
Fightin' in blind faith, led by the internal voice (I love you)
You might not wanna do it, but you don't have a choice (I hate you)
Will the pressure take me to new heights or be my demise? (I hate you)
Will my intentions coincide with what I advise? (I hate you)
The people lookin' up to me, doin' everything right (I hate you)
But who am I to tell anyone how to live their life? (I hate you)
Your pain threshold will determine if you survive
I'm amazed by it
Lyin' to myself, pretendin' I was never phased by it
Maybe 'cause you're in my DNA, that's why
You might also like
I love you

Always, I love you
But right now, I hate you
I love you

You made a promise to God to be there for your kids (I love you)
You made a promise to give them a life you didn't live (I hate you)
My ego won't fully allow me to say that I miss you (I love you)
A woman who hasn't confronted all her daddy issues (I hate you)
The day will come when you gotta find all the answers to your sins (I love you)
Pressures of providin', feelin' unhappy within (I hate you)
Or what kind of external family shit up on your plate (I love you)
But I understand wantin' and needin' an escape (I hate you)
Too much unsaid now, the silence givin' me headaches (I love you)
Only through speech can we let go of all this dead weight (I hate you)
Even though I'm angry, don't wanna be disrespectful (I love you)
Tryna figure out how to approach this in the best way (I hate you)
Hard to not carry these feelings even on my best days (I love you)
Never thought my parent would give me my first heartbreak (I hate you)
Anxiety givin' me irregular heart rate (I love you)
Used to avoid gettin' into how I really feel about this (I hate you)
Now I see how fickle life can be and so it can't wait (I love you)
Should've been the person there to hold me on my dark days (I hate you)
It's easier to stargaze and wish than be faced with this reality (I love you)
Is you a sperm donor or a dad to me? And still
I love you (Hard to love tonight)
I hate you
I love you (Hard to love tonight)
I hate you
Always, I love you
But right now, I hate you
Always, I love you (Hard to love tonight)
I hate you

On this mission, you live and learn (I love you)
The world will show you no mercy from birth (I hate you)
How do you humanise your hero? (I love you)
'Round here, you're only respected if earned (I hate you)
Half-hearted sorries, can't let your guard down (I love you)
To get to nirvana, where do you start out? (I hate you)
Angry 'cause they don't meet your unrealistic standards (I love you)
Then you realise that they're human and you calm down (I hate you)
Sometimes I'm unbalanced and I think, ""Rah, why am I losin' my steps?""
Lately, I'm paranoid, I feel my life is a mess
I'm just usin' my voice, hope it will have an effect
He was just once a boy, often I seem to forget
Lookin' at Polaroids of pictures secretly kept
You know what was destroyed, but you don't know what was left
Tryna phase out the noise of who you hear in your head
Everything is a choice and anything can be said
Is you missin' the point? Are you just hearin' me vent?
Or is you in understandin', knowin' my words will connect?
I keep you in my prayers 'cause life is short as we know
Every mistake you make should contribute to your growth
What you choose to avoid'll probably come in your dreams
I'm not forgivin' for you, man, I'm forgivin' for me

I hate you
Sometimes, I love you

I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish

Got a very big ego
Embedded in me that's the heritage ego
And let 'em hate, they ain't messing with the steeze though
And now I'm here, can't entertain no bummy niggas
Need my nigga fresh in a tuxedo
Me and my new case, steady blowing weed smoke
I'm a woman who can teach you a little something about class (Class)
Diamonds will forever be a girl's best friend (Friend)
Everything's imperative for the way I live
I know it's material, but not irrelevant
All this here is worked for, not inherited
Tell myself I write my niggas off but never did
Self loving
Need more self loving, that's how it goes
They wanna know you when you're buzzing
But first things first, number one and priority
Call it what you want, doesn't phase
Doesn't bother me, honestly

Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha
I'm so selfish

Love and hate can never be friends
Don't rush everything in this divine time
I peaked, you couldn't handle a woman in my calibre
Had to let you mature like some fine wine, yeah
No validation, no applause
You don't have to prove you got it when you know it's yours
I don't wanna feel disloyal for wanting to do me
Then you act brand new and I know the cause, wait
Call it what you like, till now I ain't ever been the selfish type
Till now I ain't ever told nobody no, don't get it twisted
This shit didn't happen overnight
Still, if your life is amazing, what you got to fear?
Can't be concerned about what they're saying over there
I make it clear, don't be in and out about what you hear
You say I always get what I want and it isn't fair
But life isn't fair, go
I can't sleep at night
I don't wanna fight
My best friend is I
I'm so selfish
Guess I'm in denial
Maybe I'm wrong, you're right
Heard it all my life

Never cared 'bout bein' immortalised
How can I stand with the opps and not with the tribe?
They sell you a dream and then want you to glorify
Got a rude awakenin' by ignorin' up all the signs
Why did I give you the keys to authorise shit on my behalf?
Now I'm scarred and mortified
What did I expect from those livin' the corporate life?
Unfortunately, honesty isn't normalised
Had to get my shit together and get organised
If your hand's in my pockets, I'm callin' up all the guys
Though, I don't wanna be the reason of more divide
Guess that's in my nature of bein' a water sign
I'm sort of like
Nothing is makin' sense in my awkward mind
Give me your ears to lend me for the night
Shootin' in the dark, guess I never saw the light
Revoke access, I'm runnin' it back, yes
Missin' opportunities, I wish I was that pressed
Yeah, I say that shit with my damn chest
You need me and you feel the loss of my absence
The novelty wears oft after a few years
After a few tears from challengin' new fears
Learnin' everything I didn't on the come up
We was too busy makin' music till the sun up
Every day through the summer
Didn't learn the business and now I'm duckin' for cover
What a fuck up
Might just leave a bad taste thinkin' I'm a sucker
Come up out my damn face, nigga, did I stutter?
It's gon' be a sad case if you see my brothers
I can see how an artist can get tainted, frustrated
They don't care if your mental is on the brink of somethin' dark
As long as you're cuttin' somebody's payslip
And sendin' their kids to private school in a spaceship
Yeah, I refuse to be on a slave ship
Give me all my masters and lower your wages
Huh, what I'm bringin' to the table is more than a feast for the belly of the beast
Didn't know I'm droppin' somethin' heavy for the streets
Fuck the politics, I'm goin' Meghan on you neeks
I need the best seats in the house
When the truth unfolds, it's gonna be one hell of a scene
Harry listenin' from Heaven on repeat
He was backin' it when nobody believed
""Play the game, play the game,"" is what they scream
You can play the game, I don't see the need, no

Feel so alive
I woke up and I prayed for a sign
I know good things take time
God sent me you as an angel
When you're alone
The little thoughts that nobody knows
Hardest thing to do was stay strong
I knew I needed an angel

My Saturn return in effect
Life doesn't come with presets
My frequency's seamless
They want you give more, expect you to dream less
Got me confessin' all my secrets
You ain't the only one under deep stress
Please don't take my kindness for a weakness
Get G checked for your disrespect
Perception and observation is clinical
More headspace, I've been shavin' off my occipital
They say you can't hate who you don't love
And they say love is unconditional
I'm ready to do the unthinkable
Fuck rules and everything that's traditional
Giving your heart to someone might just leave you in a somethin', somethin'
Feel so alive
I woke up and I prayed for a sign
I know good things take time
God sent me you as an angel
When you're alone
The little thoughts that nobody knows
Hardest thing to do was stay strong
I knew I needed an angel
An angel

How you go against the same system you were colonised by?
Brother, your whole ting compromised
Havin' these conversations with self and nobody else
Thinkin' they don't understand my thinkin' when I socialise
I need a angel with me for armour
I need accountability, partner
I know that all these blessings are karma
I need a fire lit by the seaside
Purest manuka up in my beehive
Give me a second and let the beat ride
Is there a golden key to the sweet life?
I don't know what's got into me
But at least I'm makin' time for self and not others when I got free time
New woman, don't tell me I shouldn't just because you couldn't
They say, ""Don't you give up too much of the truth to 'em""
Well, I got nine more songs in the boot for 'em
Figure this is the moment, I gotta speak now
Head high, back straight, feet down
Posture goin' crazy
Had to stand tall while they were tryin' to break me
Fuck that, you niggas didn't make me
And I say you will never infiltrate me
Dim my light? Are you crazy?
Yo, we two worlds apart, you know, lady, lady, lady
Flo and I comin' like DeNiro and Scorsese
Stop tryin' to box me in, there's no way you can place me
Hit 'em with a classic then I got a little lazy
Had to get a pen when I remembered that I'm JAY-Z
Had to cut you off because I found out you were snaky
I got angels guidin' my steps, guardin' my life from now until death
Perspective is everything and I wonder what they see
Hurt people hurt people, I get it, but don't play me
My Saturn return in effect
Life doesn't come with presets
My frequency's seamless
So, please don't take my kindness for a weakness

Me again, allow me to pick up where I left off
The biggest phenomenon and I'm Picasso with the pen
Niggas always talk shit until I hit them with the realness
Figured I should say some', but you don't wanna hear me vent
You can talk bad all day long, I will never be impressed
Dunno what I did to make you feel that you be earnin' my respect
You do not scare me, no, you are not a threat
Anyone that want it they can get it in a flash, no sweat
If you're gonna talk on my name, least say it with your chest
Got my team on deck taking out all pawns and my knight got your queen in check, mate
Don't get touchy, don't be getting in your feelings
All I do is kill shit, shit, even when I'm chillin'
I'm Jay-Z on a bad day, Shakespeare on my worst days
Never been a punk, trust you can get it in the worst way
Fuck it, lemme get a birthday cake and it ain't even my birthday
'Cause when I switch then they wanna say that I'm a bitch

You're not listening, you're not listening
I said it with my chest and I don't care who I offend, uh-huh
Haa

Came through swinging out the gate on a mad one, no fucks
Steppin' to the kid tryna bring it, I promise you'll have no luck
You sold out for a quick buzz and honey, you got no love
No less than what I know that I'm worth and I won't budge
In and out of doorways juggin'-juggin' through the broadway
Anthony, where would I be now if I went and done it your way?
I been exhausted, man, I think I need a tour break
Might take a trip to the Philippines with my Spanish boy Jorge
Holla my plug like, ""I'm back in town and I need a ounce gimme more flavs""
Take Mum on a spree like, ""Get anything you want, this is your day""
I followed the white rabbit, got a couple carrots I know that I got bad habits
Tryna find the balance, I'm in the store like, ""I wanna have it I gotta have it""
You are not the toughest or baddest, my pen is the maddest
I've probably ended careers and it's never out of malice
Gas level ain't even on 10 and still they can't manage
They think I'm a shy one, like, ""Nah Simz won't flip""
But when I switch, then they wanna say that I'm a bitch

Got in a pattern, followed the rhythm
I disregarded all opinions and continued my mission
Unapologetically I be bossin' it, getting better with age
Got it back, never lost it, my legacy remains
Rejected the dotted line but not the pen
Invested in myself, that was money well spent
Came home, mummy burning incense
'Member tryna think of ways to help contribute to the rent
Now the room's upstate, top suite penthouse
Views where there's no family or friends
What life do I want? Know I gotta choose 'fore it's too late
Well I guess it all depends, uh
I was running with Toby and them
Never looked back once I discovered the pen
Dedicated it all to the art
Who would've known it would be this from the start?
Stop fucking with my heart
Nigga, you was my dream, fool (Little bitch)

Grew up in the South side of that River Thames
Hard to think outside the box when you're stuck in the Ends
I had dreams of many things as a youngin
I was fourteen when the streets offered tough lovin'
Older brother went to jail, daddy weren't around
No choice now but to be the man of the house
If you're talking role models, nowhere to be seen
You can't fathom what I think 'til you been where I been
PTSD from the roads, trouble was everywhere that I looked
Hard to avoid it even if I just kеpt my head in my books
There ain't no еasy way out, drownin' internally
When you're stuck in a ocean of doubt with all this uncertainty
Lived bein' angry my whole life like it's part of my DNA
I couldn't tell you why it became something that we embraced
Then we take that same anger and turn it into someone else's pain
Nothing's changed here, the cycle still remains

And when mama told me, I prayed to God
To walk with me, my journey's begun
See, my mama told me my sun will shine
We don't decide everything in God's time
And when mama told me, I knew that I
Was strong inside, but we all cry sometimes

Shit changed when I had a brief encounter with death
Thought the pearly gates opened when that knife was in my chest
Not the mental scars, the physical's all you see
But the boy that stabbed me is just as damaged as me
I could have been the reflection that he hated
The part of him he wishes God did not waste time creating
The broken homes in which we're comin' from, but who's to blame when
You're dealt the same cards from the system you're enslaved in?
It's fucking mayhem
Imagine being in a hospital, wired up to the machines
They told me I had been in a coma for two weeks
But time is an illusion, my mind told me I'm invincible
But my body reminded me I'm human
When you're so close to the Heavens, God shows you who's there
Nowhere to be seen are the people who said they care

Would you take me as I am? Overlook all my mistakes?
Though correct me when I'm wrong, humble me, put me in my place?
Would you be the one I come to when I'm needin' an escape?
Still be my biggest fan if I canceled all my dates?
I got shit I haven't dealt with, would you help me through my pain?
If it's any reassurance, just know I would do the same
Lookin' at you, I know that God took His time
Hope I'm seein' the real you, not a disguise
Know I like my time alone, but still don't wanna be lonely
Whisper in my ear and tell me you won't leave
Time flies, can't tell you how much we've spent
'Cause I'm present in this moment, hope this feeling never ends

Hopin' that I never wake up
'Cause in this dream, I'll never be alone
You saved my life
I'm hopin' that I never wake up
Somethin' so special, we can't let it go
With you, I'll never be alone
I'm hopin' that I never wake up

Never thought you'd be so special in my life
This is love built over time, this wasn't love at first sight
When plannin' for my future, I've been keepin' you in mind
If we ever grow apart, hope our stars will realign
You know where you come from, you ain't forgotten
It's an honour to witness and watch you blossom
You want words of affirmation and I got 'em for you
No situation is perfect
But givin' up without tryin' is what we're not gonna do
I'm speakin' your love language, readin' body language
Our connection requires a deeper understandin'
Communication isn't always verbal
But energy transferred is universal
They talk it, but we put it into practice
Centre each other, makin' sure nothin' here can knock us off our axis
That's real companionship, you as sweet as molasses
Intelligence that's matched with beauty in all its facets
Here to see us goin' forwards and never backwards
Anyone that's in our presence sees the clear attraction
Past situations didn't work and someone done the hard graft
Just for you to reap the benefits, but that's what happens
My God, been lookin' divine lately, hydrated, melanated
Don't like the fuss, but this deserves to be celebrated
There's just certain flex that comes with feelin' exhilarated
Ain't it just the best ownin' it? Knowin' you've elevated?

Don't stop
I can feel your pain

So misunderstood
You're Miss Understood

I don't wanna be up, I been down for days
Layin' in my misery, hopin' I will be saved
Stuck in my ways, stubborn, I know it can't be changed
Livin' in isolation, attention I never crave
There go little Simbi from around the way
She wanted the credibility, never cared for fame
While the palette fades, release the colours of pain
It's a black and white world, still in the area GREY
(Don't stop) Lookin' back, was it all a waste of
Handshakes and how-are-yous and what-you've-been-up-tos
And will-you-be-home-soons and when-are-you-droppin'-again?
Sussin' me out, secretly hopin' I'm done with the pen
No receipts, can't return the gift I was sent
Everything I touch is felt with the purest intent
Conversations with you is causin' resentment
Hard to accept the realness, she said
(Don't stop) I've been lovin' you freely
Back when you was broke, handin' out them CDs
Tried to fall in love and you cut 'cause you need me
I told you, ""Give it up"" and you never believed me
Your obsession with me is with me has been your Achilles' heel
Feelings equals weakness and that's why you bury yours
Understand you are just a vessel for the Lord

Eyes wide open to fake love
'Cause no one's checkin' for you when you got it bad
And you're in the worst, lowest place, still could never crash
Strong women bounce back and secure bags
Know it's in my DNA to only be great
Niggas tryin' hard to get the juice and I'm lemonade
I write words for a livin' and still can't communicate
Honesty is in my bones, I can't do the fake
Life's too short and I've seen too many tears
I've come too far for me to be consumed by my fears
Can't believe the space I'm in with my older sister
I left the global empire and now she thinks I dissed her
It weren't that, I just needed to explore shit on my own
I just needed to figure out—, mmm
I probably let my anger get the best of me
When it comes to family, see, now you testin' me
You want my everything until there's nothing left of me
I just wanted you to call me, sayin', ""Hey, sis, how's your day been?
How's your love life? Who you datin'?
Oh, he fucked up? Girl, I had the same thing
But there's a bigger picture God is painting""
It's hard mixing family and business

Bitch, you thirsty, please grab a Sprite
My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, it gets shady
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson, or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the D-low, and he know

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)

Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me

You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk

Still down, I'm a Norf Norf soldier
G slide right down Sawyer

Another story of a young Black man
Tryna make it up out that jam, Goddamn
Bag back, let me make my bands, got plans
If you hatin', don't shake my hand
Take it easy, homie

In the foreign with the GPS addressed to your mama house
Compensation, conversations, what I'm all about
Took the smart route, never been marked out
Shoulda been dead broke, shoulda been chalked out
But it didn't happen, now it's time to get it cracking

Wanna fuck now, they beg to bend over
Half these hoes chauffeurs, half these hoes useless
Fucked the face toothless, easy, so ruthless
Ask where he from then leave his dome roofless
Sweet Chin Music kick back, gruesome
Watch out for Judas, Vice and G Unit
5-0 fucking with the yayo too

And play this shit in Ironwood where my little brother livin'
Live or die for the whoopin' or the Crippin', pick a side
Death row, till they put you in the Pikachu to fry
That's life, three strikes, that's life

Long road to the riches, bravos from the bitches

Hope your skin is black as midnight, I'll take you out that Honda
I can put you in a Benz, I can balance out your chakras
Fornication is a sin, we can fuck all night regardless
Our father art in heaven as I pray for new McLarens
Pray the police don't come blow me down 'cause of my complexion
Everybody think they know me now 'cause I'm chicken-checkin'
Negro, you are not my homie, how dare you think it's different?
Boy, you trippin'

Gas break and dip, the cash came, I flipped
And stacked that, yeah, I stacked that past the ceiling
So sacrilegious, don't ask to chat
And don't ask for pictures, back back, I'm trippin'

Go in 'til they take my bro and 'em out them CDCRs
Prison system broken, racial war commotion
Until the president get ashy, Vincent won't be votin'
We need Tamikas and Shaniquas in that Oval Office

So tell me, what's the difference? So tell me, what's the difference? (All right!)
I feel like ""Fuck Versace"", they raping niggas' pockets
And we don't get acknowledged, just thank me for the profit
A prophet just like Moses, and Moses looked like Shaka
Zulu, my .44 loaded, I'm aiming at Nirvana (Nirvana)
My bitch look like Madonna ('Donna), they staring at Katana
Waiter still ain't brought the chopsticks, should've brought the chopper (Whoo)
Uber driver in the cockpit look like Jeffrey Dahmer
But he looking at me crazy when we pull up to the projects

See, this weight is on my shoulders, pray, Jehovah, lift me up
And my pain is never over, pills and potions, fix me up
I just want to live it up, can a motherfucker breathe?
Life ain't always what it seems, so, please (Hey)

This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby

Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever, baby
Open up your eyes and tell me what you thinking
Open up your mind, and tell me what you seeing inside of me
Why we fussing, fucking up this evening?
I probably couldn't fix it if I knew the reason
Up on the sea, where I see you fallin' in the deep end
Is it love? I would really love to know the meaning
What's the grudge that you're holdin'? Hold my hand
Let me take you to the land where the ocean and the sands are meetin'
Look at the sun, all we need to see to know our freedom
Open up your heart
If we don't love, then we fall apart

This could be forever, baby
I never seen you wetter, baby
Than when the tears fall, soakin' up your sweater, baby
I didn't mean harm—don't make me regret it, baby
'Cause if I never knew you, I could never do this to you
Hope you understand
They never taught me how to be a man, only how to be a shooter
I only need the time to prove it
'Cause this could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, baby
This could be forever, maybe
Do you like the sunshine, do you like the snow?
Do you wanna talk about it, or be alone?
I think that you should know
That this could be forever, baby

My teachers told me we was slaves
My mama told me we was kings
I don't know who to listen to
I guess we somewhere in between
My feelings told me love is real
But feelings known to get you killed
I feel as if I'm misconstrued
I spend my moments missing you
I'm searching for atonement
Do I blame my darker tone?
I know somethings are better left unsaid and people left alone

As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man
Be like my daddy's friends, hopping out that minivan
Chrome '38s spinning like a ceiling fan
Crying on my momma's phone swearing he a different man
Talking to me monotone, hardly ever coming home
Knew he was the villain never been a fan of Superman
Beaten on my momma in the kitchen screaming:
""Bitch you better listen when I speak my mind!""
Used to think he was unbreakable he did fed time
But made sure a nigga plate was full and I shined
Was walking in the first day of school new J's, and all of that
Football was cornerback, never made a game I played for Compton High
But my daddy was the man that would be suicide
Picked me up from visitation in the newest ride
Always told me that he loved me, fuck his foolish pride
As a kid all I wanted was to kill a man

Cause my daddy did it, eyes bloodshot
With the caddy tinted, fuck handouts
Fuck the county building, never seen that

Black bandana on his arm, needle in his hand

Drinking Hen' with his homies blowing cig' smoke

What's your addiction, baby?
Love can make a bitch go crazy
Kiss, hug, fuck, and then get faded
Fall out, and it's all-out war
Head twirl, and your vision blurrin'
Dopeman in that kitchen stirrin'
Sold it, we so lit, dope burners
Fuck is you so forgetful for?
Girl, you know that you need that raw
Girl, you know that you need Visine
Preem laced with that cocaín'
Pop a pill, pop what's in them jeans
Cop a feel, cop a half-sixteen
Pour a deuce up, and then start leaning
Tryna die higher than Pimp C
And Big Moe, you know how the shit go
(You know how the shit go)

I pray to God 'cause I need Him
I need Him, I need Him
Cocaine withdrawals, and I'm fiending
I'm fiending, I'm fiending
Life way too hard, am I dreaming?
I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming

I be all around the city with the semi naughty crippin'
All the homies say I'm different, police say I raise suspicion
Buy a million-dollar home and blow my dome to paint the kitchen
Bitches like, ""Is that Venetian?""
Niggas salty when they meet him
Cause they never finna beat him
And they'll never get a feature
I'm a star, tell Billy I'ma bill him for the sneakers
You conversin' with a nigga, better be about the green
I've been broke, I ain't goin' back
Rather go to Calipat, or murdered while I'm shootin' back
Call me King Latifah
If we talkin' bout your bitch and she a keeper
Better keep her in the house
Watch your mouth
Don't be talkin' from the bleachers, nigga

Softly as if I played piano in the dark
Found a way to channel my anger now to embark
The world's a stage and everybody's got to play their part
God...with the signal clear as day
Put my Glock, put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay
Put my Glock away I got a stronger weapon
That never runs out of ammunition so I'm ready for war, okay

My bitch look like Mona Lisa
Hammers busting like a soda in the freezer
Think of heading to Ibiza
Need a breather from the tripping
Either that or my brains to the ceiling
Bite the bullet, tryna fight the feeling
Fuck around and pull it, push it to the limit
Ain't a thang to a G
Life give you lemons, nigga hang from a tree
Cold game all came in a dream
Woke up feeling like the walls caved in
Fought to the death, never gave in
Write that on the grave that I get laid in
Heaven, Hell, free or jail, same shit
County jail bus, slave ship, same shit

Learned the power of words when we was younger
Saying fuck the sign on his curb can make him hunt you
Turned the African into the nigga then they hung him
Said it earlier in the verse, sometimes I wonder
Who the activist and who the Devil's advocate
Or do it matter? Shit
They only fucking with the rapper if the rapper rich
Or got a platinum hit
A chain or two
Seem the music interchangeable
Raging bull, what you headed for?
Heaven doors, or hell below
I write directions for the road to let you know
Edgar Allen Poe
Tried to warn 'em of demise and all he seen was crows
Feel for 'em, words, we kill for 'em
Leave the bitchin' to the birds, we still war'n

Let 'em pop shit, gimme some drums to go pop with
Need white women at the shows unconscious

Prolly 'cause I'm feelin' like the world gon' crash
Read a hundred somethin' on the E-class dash
If I'm feelin' funny, guaranteed gon' flash
Cock back, blast, put 'em in a bag
Prolly gon' regret it in the retrospect
Got a lot of problems I ain't let go yet

Spend a lot of money on the CDG
Ain't I lookin' lovely on the TV screen?
Battle with the white man day by day
Feds takin' pictures doin' play by play
They don’t ever want to see the Black man eat
Nails in the Black man's hands and feet
Put him on a cross, so we put him on a chain

Fall with the rules to bask in the glory

Tryna fight for what's right and got sidetracked
Where your mind at? Never mind that
Can we think in a blink, you swimmin', you sinkin'
You win, you leavin' a head where I've loaded my weapon
I stay with my brethren, I pray for protection
My prey in my sight so I'm doing what's right and not askin' no questions
I wanna be home free, where's one that was lonely?
But I'm ready and waitin'
For my day of salvation, and I'm patient

(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I’m coming home now
I’m coming home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

They're looking for saviors, I'm looking for safety
They never gon' break me, take me
Down on my knees, believe I'm never gon' beg or plead
Yeah, I never say never, but I guarantee
Gather my strength, goin' hard in the paint
Paint you a picture, it's put on display
I'm gonna get, they don't give then I take
Can't take me down now
My feet on the ground now
Fight 'til I'm down now
Say it out loud now
Say it out loud, are you ready for war?
You might also like
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
I’m coming home now
I’m coming home
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Right where I belong now
Right where I belong

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh20Embed",https://images.genius.com/50aad9654ca5d87e5ca278c85511792d.1000x1000x1.jpg
